trickle bits of water on leaves,

117

and getting as much water as

119
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,313

00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:54,914
>> Come on!

195
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,415
>> It's tiring.

196
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,375
It's very tiring.

197
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,251
>> It is.

198
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,043
>> It's going to take a long

199
00:06:59,127 --> 00:06:59,961
time to do.

200
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:00,878
Do you want to take a break?

201
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,630
>> Go, go, go, go, go.

202
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:06,134
>> Right now, Ravu is in pretty

203
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:09,303
bad shape.

204
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:09,887
We've got heart for days, but

205
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,514
heart doesn't do any good when

206
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,808
you're as thirsty and hungry as

207
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,101
we are.

208
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,561
We rub sticks and we rub more

209
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:17,937
sticks.

210
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,521
Rubbing sticks is great if you

211
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,690
have 30 people who are all

212
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,483
hydrated and have energy.

213
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,527
When you have eight people who

214
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,654
are tired as hell and who have

215
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,906
no water in their system, it

216
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,367
burns you out pretty fast.

217
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:43,838
>> So since we did not get any

218
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,798
fire yet and weren't able to

219
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:46,632
boil water, the plan here is to

220
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,469
fill up as many canisters as we

221
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,888
can with coconut water.

222
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,682
With a good knife, it takes

223
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,267
about a minute to crack open a

224
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,351
coconut.

225
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,436
With a bad knife it takes, like,

226
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,395
three, four, minutes.

227
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:00,521
I mean, that really takes a lot

228
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:01,939
more energy.

229
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:02,565
>> I think I can get one open in

230
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:06,444
one minute.

231
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,658
What's that, 30 seconds?

232
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,785
>> Ooh!

233
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,121
A little cocky, are we, buddy?

234
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,080
I didn't know we had a

235
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:18,873
competition.

236
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:19,874
>> Let's get the stopwatch out.

237
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:20,958
>> Trying to take your title,

238
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,210
there.

239
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,669
>> They are completely full.

240
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:31,719
>> Are you kidding me?

241
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:35,598
Nothing!

242
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,350
>> Today, what's going on is

243
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,601
basically everyone's beat.

244
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,852
Nobody really has the energy to

245
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,145
chop anything open or run

246
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,647
around, so you, like, chop up

247
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,023
five coconuts, take a nap for an

248
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,275
hour.

249
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:50,988
I'm telling you, right now,

250
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,114
nobody has a clue.

251
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,241
We're walking around into the

252
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,117
rocks and the trees, guy.

253
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,452
Half of us can't even stand up

254
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:57,954
for more than, like, an hour and

255
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,206
a half, I'm telling you.

256
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:00,790
I just... you know, I've never

257
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,625
experienced dehydration like

258
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,087
this so much.

259
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,588
You guys want this, or what?

260
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:08,839
>> Rocky, just swallow it.

261
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,216
>> Yeah?

262
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,176
I was eating clams off the

263
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:12,760
ground.

264
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,680
I don't do that!

265
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,348
I eat clams, too.

266
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,683
I don't eat them off the ground.

267
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:19,976
Huh?

268
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,018
No!

269
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:21,936
It's crazy!

270
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,313
We're starving here, bro!

271
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:33,739
>> On the stick?

272
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,741
>> On the sign.

273
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:36,701
>> Man, you'd better get some

274
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,411
water into that.

275
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,288
>> Boo caught something in his

276
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,831
eye, and his eye's red.

277
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,166
He's got an obvious indentation

278
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,543
in his eye.

279
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,502
Just blink with your eye as I'm

280
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,670
pouring it in.

281
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,671
Try to go as long as you can.

282
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,798
Just blink.

283
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,758
Just keep it, keep it.

284
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,302
It's going to be bad.

285
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,344
It's going to be annoying.

286
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,304
Just keep it.

287
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,973
All right.

288
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,647
>> Look how he dropped that ax

289
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:10,776
so close to his leg.

290
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,237
>> Oh, my god, Boo, be careful.

291
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,199
>> Oops.

292
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,200
>> Oh, my god.

293
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,288
>> Oh, my god, Boo, how did it

294
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:22,788
happen?

295
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,291
>> Hang on.

296
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:25,833
>> I just barely finished

297
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,668
helping him with the eye

298
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,753
situation, and the next thing

299
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,212
you know, he takes an ax, and

300
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,465
literally the ax went through

301
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,090
the finger and right down to the

302
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,051
knee.

303
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,344
>> Quit worrying about my

304
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,386
injury.

305
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,346
>> We aren't worrying about your

306
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,221
injury.

307
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:39,972
>> We have other stuff we need

308
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:40,765
to do.

309
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:41,682
>> Like what?

310
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,224
>> I will tell y'all when I

311
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:42,725
think I need some help.

312
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,851
>> It's too late then, Boo.

313
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,228
Boo is very stubborn.

314
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,022
He's a real hazard to himself.

315
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:48,898
I can see it happening where we

316
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,900
don't have to vote nobody out

317
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,234
sooner or later.

318
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,404
For real, he has one leg, one

319
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,907
hand, and one eye.

320
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,908
He really ain't no good to us

321
00:10:58,991 --> 00:10:59,867
now.

322
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,785
What can we do?

323
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:01,410
We've got to think about that

324
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,578
kind of stuff.

325
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:03,579
That's the kind of stuff I'll be

326
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:04,538
thinking about, you know what

327
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,289
I'm saying?

328
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,123
Everybody knows it.

329
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:06,916
Everybody is predicting it.

330
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:07,750
Boo will hurt himself out of the

331
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,086
game.

332
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,548
>> Darn it, Boo!

333
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,633
>> Oh, my god.

334
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,426
>> Had to happen to me.

335
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,943
>> Sylvia.

336
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:34,860
>> Is she here?

337
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,613
>> Yeah.

338
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,198
Yeah, there she is.

339
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:42,660
Come on, you guys.

340
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:46,372
>> Hey, Anthony!

341
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,456
What are you guys called again?

342
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,416
>> Ravu.

343
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,583
>> Ravu!

344
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:50,960
I knew it was going to be good.

345
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,254
Did you guys make a home?

346
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,381
>> Huh?

347
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,465
>> Did you make a home or are

348
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,425
you waiting for me?

349
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,342
>> We waited for you.

350
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,468
>> Oh, my god.

351
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,846
>> Oh, my god, it was horrible.

352
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,848
Hi!

353
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,766
I was... I was hoping... I was

354
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,310
hoping I would be on your team.

355
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:08,894
>> Welcome home!

356
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,981
When Sylvia came back from Exile

357
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,482
Island, everybody was excited.

358
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,108
But when I went up to greet her,

359
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,444
I had only one thing in my mind,

360
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,195
and that was to see if she found

361
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:18,821
the immunity idol.

362
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,282
So when I was giving her a hug I

363
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:21,824
was actually quite nasty.

364
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,160
I looked over her shoulder and

365
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,078
opened up her shoulder bag and

366
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:26,954
did a little quick search, and I

367
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,165
didn't find anything.

368
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,458
>> Oh, my god!

369
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,083
>> That was my first thought in

370
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,043
mind-- "When I'm hugging her,

371
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,628
I'm going to feel her up and see

372
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,589
if the idol is there."

373
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,173
>> I made fire for the first

374
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:41,385
time in my life.

375
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,345
There's no flint here?

376
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,680
>> No, we had no fire here.

377
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:45,139
>> We've got nothing.

378
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,015
>> We don't have water.

379
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,100
>> So when I got here and they

380
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,353
told me they had no fire and no

381
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,689
water at all, you know, you're

382
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,441
just kind of like, "We're stuck

383
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,901
in a really bad situation."

384
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,153
So how many canteens do we have

385
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,196
filled yet?

386
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:00,988
>> None.

387
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:01,864
>> We're just starting the

388
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:02,072
process.

389
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,866
Okay.

390
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,702
Isn't that awesome?

391
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:06,911
>> Here.

392
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,704
I'll try it, Erica.

393
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:09,872
Okay, so...

394
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:10,831
>> You need to give it a good

395
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,541
whack.

396
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,752
Here, over the... so you drip...

397
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,003
>> Hey, it ain't working for me,

398
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,880
guys.

399
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:18,881
>> Harder.

400
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:19,215
Just hit hard.

401
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,718
>> I am!

402
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,054
I feel like at this point I'm a

403
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,931
bit extraneous.

404
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,766
I'm a bit like... because I

405
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,726
missed the whole day with them,

406
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,061
and they've got the whole rhythm

407
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,103
going, so I feel like I'm coming

408
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,313
in and trying to help, but I'm

409
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,981
not...

410
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,024
>> Oh, man.

411
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,901
>> ... you know, part of the

412
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,152
core right now.

413
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,570
If the sun gets intense for long

414
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,781
enough, you might get something

415
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,366
there.

416
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,367
It looks like your left hand

417
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,409
could use a little support.

418
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,285
Could you?

419
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:48,953
Um...

420
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,121
>> Michelle.

421
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,998
>> Yeah.

422
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,917
>> I was not really excited for

423
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,168
Sylvia to come back.

424
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,711
I already didn't have great

425
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:58,337
feelings about her personality.

426
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,297
I personally think she's a

427
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,006
little bossy, and just likes to

428
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,008
push people around.

429
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,385
>> How about fishing along the

430
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,095
shore?

431
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,805
>> We can try it.

432
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,766
>> You know, if this is low

433
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:11,976
tide, we ought to go out and get

434
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:12,893
some oysters.

435
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:13,978
>> In many ways, Sylvia's the

436
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,564
outsider.

437
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,565
She kind of does rub people the

438
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,649
wrong way.

439
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:19,692
I mean, it's not so much that

440
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,777
she's a bad person.

441
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,404
It's just that she's... for lack

442
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,739
of a better word, she's bossy.

443
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:05,779
>> Yep.

444
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:06,405
If I throw the machete, are you

445
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,866
going to catch it?

446
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,579
>> There you go.

447
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,414
>> Being on<i> Survivor</i> is pretty

448
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,832
much a little bit easier than

449
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:17,207
being homeless.

450
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,125
Hey, watch out!

451
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,084
Look, I'm going to bring down a

452
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,713
family of them.

453
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:23,922
>> Oh, that was a good one,

454
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:24,882
buddy.

455
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,884
You got six out of that.

456
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,427
>> When I was first homeless, I

457
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,763
was about seven years old

458
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:31,889
because my momma started doing

459
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,390
drugs.

460
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,433
>> I wouldn't step on that one

461
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,934
for too much security.

462
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,061
>> Our momma was a crackhead.

463
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,354
And my brothers and sisters and

464
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,730
I decided all we got is each

465
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:40,189
other and ourselves.

466
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,441
And so we used to just get the

467
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,776
food out of the trash can that

468
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,027
people throw away.

469
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,571
It's very similar, having to go

470
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,156
out and get food, having to find

471
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,407
food.

472
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,700
And when you find food you ain't

473
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,326
going to be greedy and eat it

474
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,328
yourself because you're hungry,

475
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:54,995
because you know everybody else

476
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,623
is hungry, too.

477
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,040
>> That's beautiful.

478
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,084
That's a beautiful thing.

479
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,794
>> There's so much more, there

480
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,920
are so many more.

481
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,214
The more trees we find, the more

482
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,049
we run wild.

483
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,342
I know my teammates don't know

484
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,009
what it's like to suffer.

485
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,220
When I first got here, I was

486
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,346
like, "What are these people

487
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,347
doing here?"

488
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,390
I don't think they know what

489
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,516
it's like to struggle.

490
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,892
I think this is the most

491
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:18,435
struggle some people had that's

492
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,645
here, which is not really even a

493
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:20,854
struggle to me.

494
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:21,939
This is easier than being

495
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:22,439
homeless on the street.

496
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,148
I know people are going to be

497
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,442
jealous.

498
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,777
People sitting at home, they're

499
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,695
going to be jealous, because

500
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:28,570
we've got more food here than

501
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,114
they have in their refrigerator.

502
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,323
>> Oh, wow.

503
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,825
That would be sad.

504
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:33,909
>> Yeah, that would be really

505
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:34,785
sad.

506
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:35,703
>> This is more food that I've

507
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,287
got in my refrigerator.

508
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,330
>> I have a weight of

509
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,331
responsibility to last in this

510
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,332
game, because I do want to help

511
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,542
my family.

512
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,461
I'm in an amazing spot in my

513
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,046
life right now.

514
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,965
I'm going to help my family when

515
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,341
I get back.

516
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,567
>> Ahoy!

517
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,902
I am beyond starving.

518
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,112
I'm looking for anything, any

519
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:14,867
tree of life, anything.

520
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,704
>> Look on the ground, man.

521
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,831
>> Hey, this is something.

522
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,458
Are those nuts?

523
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,876
>> Mango, bro.

524
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,127
>> Yeah, it's a mango.

525
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,420
This is definitely the beginning

526
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:27,713
stages.

527
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,339
Can't eat them.

528
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,174
I'm going to go up here a little

529
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:34,052
bit more and see.

530
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,194
We went all the way up to the

531
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,863
top, around, nothing.

532
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,407
I went all the way up that way.

533
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,325
There's no other fruit here.

534
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,745
Nothing.

535
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,550
>> Oh, my god.

536
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,885
Pineapples.

537
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,720
There are so many of them.

538
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,555
Hey!

539
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,307
>> Oh, my god!

540
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,142
>> Pineapples.

541
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,560
This is ready.

542
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,479
>> Pineapple!

543
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,563
>> We're running around hungry

544
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,689
and stupid for the past few

545
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,857
days.

546
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,150
We've been looking over there.

547
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,527
>> Amazing!

548
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,736
>> Beautiful!

549
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,946
>> We've been trekking the whole

550
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:34,530
island, climbing mountains and

551
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:39,159
stuff, and right in front of us

552
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,452
has been, like, hundreds of

553
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,995
pineapples, sitting there.

554
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,790
>> Oh, my god!

555
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,792
>> Erica, you're the hero.

556
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,126
>> Oh, my god!

557
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,253
>> No way!

558
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,922
>> Oh, sweet!

559
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,716
>> Oh, my god!

560
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,218
>> We've got pineapple power for

561
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,678
the challenge tomorrow.

562
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,347
>> This is huge.

563
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,640
This is... now I'll be ready.

564
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:02,683
I'll be ready.

565
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:03,725
Wow, a miracle.

566
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,810
And she just stumbled on to it.

567
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,520
Me and Erica, we're getting

568
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,021
married now.

569
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,314
She just saved my life.

570
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,357
And I appreciate that.

571
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,150
That's a good woman.

572
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,068
>> I just want to smile.

573
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:14,987
I just want to smile.

574
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,872
>> Yo!

575
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,040
>> Hey!

576
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,542
>> What is that thing?

577
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,293
>> Tree mail?

578
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,879
>> Bring it here.

579
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,964
>> Is that fire?

580
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:34,339
>> We got mail.

581
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,424
>> No.

582
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,258
No fire, stupid.

583
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,176
He goes, "Fire?"

584
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,011
Yeah, I got fire right here,

585
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,262
buddy.

586
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,306
"Run, paddle, pull, think.

587
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,390
This one's anybody's game.

588
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,559
Teamwork and the will to win..."

589
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:46,643
>> We've got the will!

590
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,686
We've got the will!

591
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:48,645
>> That's right.

592
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:49,646
..."helps with food and saves

593
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,856
your flame."

594
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,232
>> Key word, "flame," baby.

595
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,860
We've got fire.

596
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,069
>> We've got flint.

597
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,906
We've got heart.

598
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,867
>> I am not going to have any

599
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,119
problems kicking butt today.

600
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:04,620
It's definitely all about

601
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,412
payback today.

602
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,497
I mean, we helped build that

603
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,624
shelter.

604
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,125
We wasted all of our fresh

605
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,418
energy on making that camp home.

606
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,754
So today is the day that we can

607
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:14,421
get back at them and we can make

608
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:17,549
them suffer a little bit.

609
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,259
>> Ow!

610
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,137
>> I want to win for many

611
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,388
reasons.

612
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,015
I'm the most vulnerable member

613
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,433
of the tribe right now, having

614
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,393
been an outsider, and I've

615
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,187
realized for a couple of days

616
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,605
now, of course, that the

617
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,190
immunity idol is here at camp.

618
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,192
But I haven't had the strength,

619
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,860
the energy, or really

620
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,278
opportunity to go look for it.

621
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,321
So there is no option for me to

622
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,073
lose.

623
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:44,743
Because I know the consequences.

624
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,419
>> I hope y'all feel that

625
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,629
nervousness coming on.

626
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:56,588
It's time.

627
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:57,798
It's go-home day.

628
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,466
It's go-home day for somebody.

629
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:00,968
Somebody got to go home today.

630
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:01,969
And we don't plan on it being

631
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:02,970
us.

632
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:03,971
It's go-home day, and we want to

633
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:04,388
stay on go-home day.

634
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:08,141
>> Y'all doing it, I'm going it.

635
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:08,684
It's definitely game on, and

636
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:09,476
we're pumped.

637
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,311
We're pumped in more ways than

638
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:11,687
they can imagine.

639
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,689
Our tribe has a distinct

640
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,773
advantage.

641
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,108
It's a huge advantage where

642
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:16,650
we've been fed, we've been

643
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:17,401
happy, we've been cracking up

644
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,360
laughing, we've been sleeping

645
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,403
well.

646
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,363
We're going to be calm.

647
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,447
We're going to be steady.

648
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,490
They're going to be nervous.

649
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,616
We don't want to lose, but we

650
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,826
know in our minds we're not

651
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:26,827
starting from the bottom

652
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,453
anymore.

653
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,920
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

654
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,010
Moto, getting your first look at

655
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,678
the new Ravu tribe.

656
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:45,387
Jessica voted out at the first

657
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,431
tribal council.

658
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:50,684
Sylvia has taken her spot.

659
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,102
First order of business.

660
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,271
Sylvia, your buff.

661
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:54,730
You're now official.

662
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,648
>> Finally.

663
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,569
>> PROBST: All right, first

664
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,611
things first.

665
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,281
Take back immunity.

666
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,703
Immunity, back up for grabs.

667
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,246
For today's challenge, each

668
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:12,581
tribe will paddle in a canoe out

669
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,751
and around your tribe flag.

670
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:16,460
On your way back, you must

671
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:19,171
collect four supply crates.

672
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,589
Each time you paddle over a

673
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,590
crate, one tribe member will

674
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:25,177
attach a long rope to the crate.

675
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,346
Once you're back to shore,

676
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,264
you'll pull the crates in and

677
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:30,766
carry them to your tribe mat.

678
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,100
When you have all four crates on

679
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,560
your mat, you'll untie them to

680
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,562
find six puzzle pole pieces and

681
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,106
a flag.

682
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,483
The first tribe to correctly

683
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:40,984
assemble their puzzle pole with

684
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,402
their flag and raise it wins the

685
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,154
challenge.

686
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,113
Want to know what you're playing

687
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:45,906
for?

688
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:46,990
>> Yes.

689
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,909
>> PROBST: A lot of fishing

690
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:49,493
gear.

691
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,535
>> Nice.

692
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,788
>> Oh, man.

693
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,122
>> PROBST: Ravu, because you

694
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:54,706
still do not have fire, you're

695
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,167
still playing for fire in the

696
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:57,626
form of flint.

697
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,503
>> Let's get it, baby.

698
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:00,420
>> PROBST: Talk about making a

699
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:00,629
change.

700
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,380
It would be nice to have some

701
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,215
water, wouldn't it?

702
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,007
>> Yes, it would.

703
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:04,841
>> PROBST: And the most

704
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:05,634
important thing in this game,

705
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,676
immunity.

706
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,011
In addition, the winning tribe

707
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,221
will choose one member from the

708
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,515
losing tribe to go to Exile

709
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:12,891
Island.

710
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,935
There is a lot at stake, winner

711
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,061
take all.

712
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:16,978
Worth playing for?

713
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:17,854
>> Yes.

714
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:18,730
>> PROBST: Give you a minute to

715
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,316
strategize, we'll get started.

716
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:24,611
Here we go.

717
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,530
Ravu looking for some revenge.

718
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,489
Moto looking to put them deeper

719
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,658
in the hole.

720
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,201
For reward and immunity,

721
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,369
survivors ready?

722
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,745
Go!

723
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,421
Got to go out past your flag and

724
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,965
then head back!

725
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,007
>> Row!

726
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:46,591
Row!

727
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,593
Row!

728
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:49,761
Dig deep, you guys!

729
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,721
>> All right, you guys, reverse

730
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,973
it, reverse it.

731
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,182
>> Start backpedaling.

732
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,893
>> Go backwards.

733
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,479
>> PROBST: Ravu makes the turn.

734
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,106
Moto makes the turn.

735
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,399
Both tribes dead even as they

736
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:05,819
pass their flag heading back.

737
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:08,280
Rain starting to come down.

738
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,199
Ravu right on line.

739
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,784
>> Say when, say when.

740
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,954
>> PROBST: Michelle clips in for

741
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:16,913
Ravu.

742
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:17,831
>> Push!

743
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:18,832
Push!

744
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,250
>> PROBST: Stacy clips in for

745
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,793
Moto.

746
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:22,878
>> Don't stop!

747
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:23,962
Don't stop!

748

Ravu clipped into their second

752
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:30,468
crate.

753
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,469
>> Go!

754
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:35,557
>> Push, push!

755
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,727
>> Stop, stop, stop!

756
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,519
>> Get it out of the boat!

757
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,687
>> PROBST: Moto's rope is

758
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,730
tangled.

759
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,274
They're losing time.

760
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,859
Ravu getting a big break.

761
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,194
>> Hurry!

762
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,445
Come on!

763
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:49,070
>> PROBST: Moto has their second

764
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,530
crate.

765
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,740
Michelle clips in for Ravu,

766
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,159
extending the lead.

767
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,660
>> Backpedal here.

768
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,704
Backpedal!

769
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,581
Backpedal!

770
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:05,045
>> You guys, keep it going.

771
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,338
>> PROBST: Michelle has clipped

772
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:07,964
in the fourth and final crate

773
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:08,548
for Ravu.

774
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,717
They're heading back to shore.

775
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,927
>> Let's go!

776
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,470
>> Stacy clips in with the third

777
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,597
crate for Moto

778
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,640
>> Untangle that rope.

779
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,643
Come on, let's go!

780
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,978
>> PROBST: Moto clipping into

781
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,230
their fourth crate.

782
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:26,816
They're heading to shore.

783
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,068
It's going to come down to

784
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:28,985
strength now.

785
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,028
>> Go, go, go.

786
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:30,904
>> PROBST: Which tribe can get

787
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,323
their crates in more quickly?

788
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,579
Ravu working together very well.

789
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,456
Still with the lead.

790
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,833
Ravu, got to get that fourth

791
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,418
crate up there.

792
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,962
Keep moving!

793
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,630
Go, start untying!

794
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:52,342
Ravu untying their crates.

795
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:52,884
Moto back with their third

796
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:56,221
crate.

797
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,394
The guys trying to get that

798
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,980
fourth crate back quickly.

799
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,314
Go, Moto!

800
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:06,648
Start untying!

801
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:07,607
>> Let's go!

802
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,692
Put it together now!

803
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,694
>> PROBST: Which tribe works

804
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:11,736
together well here will win this

805
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,988
challenge.

806
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,490
>> I have the bottom piece.

807
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:21,913
>> It's not fitting.

808
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,957
>> That was it!

809
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,417
>> PROBST: Erica certain she's

810
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,751
right.

811
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,627
Nobody's listening.

812
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:32,090
>> Everybody calm down.

813
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:44,853
>> PROBST: Moto very close.

814
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,730
>> That's it, turn it.

815
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:47,814
Put it in, put it in!

816
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:48,857
>> PROBST: Moto thinks they have

817
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,400
it.

818
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,901
>> Go, go, go!

819
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,614
>> Everybody!

820
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:57,032
>> One, two, three!

821
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,700
>> PROBST: Moto wins the

822
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,453
challenge!

823
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,716
>> PROBST: Moto, once again,

824
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,844
you're safe from tribal council,

825
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:21,056
and you'll be taking back a lot

826
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:21,848
of fishing gear.

827
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,684
Ravu, more bad news for you.

828
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:25,935
Somebody's going to be going to

829
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,145
Exile Island.

830
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,772
The only saving grace is that

831
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:29,731
whoever Moto chooses will be

832
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,858
safe from tribal council

833
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,401
tonight.

834
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,861
Moto, give me your decision.

835
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:37,197
>> It's Earl.

836
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,531
>> PROBST: Okay, Earl.

837
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,450
Boat's waiting for you.

838
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,659
You will get another clue to the

839
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:42,285
whereabouts of a hidden immunity

840
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,787
idol.

841
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,330
Watch out for the sea snakes.

842
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,748
>> I'll eat them.

843
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:47,707
>> PROBST: Ravu, tonight you

844
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,877
lose another member to tribal

845
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,836
council.

846
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,754
You have the afternoon to figure

847
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:53,296
out who that's going to be.

848
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,547
Grab your stuff, head on back to

849
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:55,965
camp.

850
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,154
>> "Here you won't find the idol

851
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,280
you crave.

852
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,615
Search back at your camp if you

853
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,325
hope to be saved."

854
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:22,826
Clue number two:

855
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,994
"To search with success you must

856
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,246
become centered under the

857
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:27,497
highest point upon which you

858
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,998
have entered."

859
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,166
Back at the camp where I just

860
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,626
left?

861
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,503
Wow!

862
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:34,504
To find out that the idol was

863
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:35,922
back at camp was very shocking.

864
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,590
But it doesn't really matter

865
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,216
that Sylvia has that first clue,

866
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,759
because as of tonight, she most

867
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:43,471
likely will be gone.

868
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,018
Exile is an upgrade from how we

869
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,270
were living.

870
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:50,854
For one, I have fire.

871
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:51,896
But at the same time, I'm not

872
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,856
involved on what's going on at

873
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:56,443
the camp.

874
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,618
There's a freaking snake.

875
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,163
The highly poisonous sea snake.

876
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,926
Can't take that chance.

877
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:22,802
Can't take that chance.

878
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,054
That same one.

879
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,182
It's like<i> Saving Private Ryan.</i>

880
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,475
If you let that one go, it might

881
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,059
come back and get you later.

882
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,769
Sorry, buddy.

883
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:32,353
I really don't like killing

884
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,730
animals.

885
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:34,272
Snakes are misunderstood.

886
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:34,939
But we have an understanding

887
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:38,359
now.

888
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,164
>> That one was a tough loss,

889
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,499
guys.

890
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:53,666
Just wait till the challenges

891
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,542
when there aren't no puzzles.

892
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,877
We'll kill everybody, you know

893
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,920
what I mean?

894
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:57,921
>> I love you.

895
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,005
>> It's the puzzles that kick

896
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,381
our ass every time, bro, every

897
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,966
time.

898
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,093
>> Here we are, we bust our

899
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,471
asses today, and what do we got?

900
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:07,472
Nothing.

901
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:08,640
Empty-handed.

902
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:09,766
You know, we can't even win with

903
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:10,808
the sun.

904
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:11,351
And now we've got to go to

905
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:11,935
tribal council again.

906
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,019
And that's just frustrating.

907
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:15,104
I'm just mad.

908
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,523
I'm mad and a whole lot tired,

909
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:22,403
and it's only day six.

910
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,865
It's only day six!

911
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,325
I just want some freaking water,

912
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,702
that's all.

913
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:48,972
>> I'd say Erica panicked today.

914
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,474
You know, she was kind of grumpy

915
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:52,976
and screaming, which is all

916
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,561
right, because we always... you

917
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:55,770
know, lot of us are.

918
00:30:55,853 --> 00:30:56,604
But not at the challenges, you

919
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,522
know?

920
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:58,314
She's screaming, she's yelling

921
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,107
at people about pieces, this and

922
00:30:59,190 --> 00:30:59,899
that, when it wasn't even her

923
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,068
place to be there.

924
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,625
>> Mookie's probably going to be

925
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,876
my partner in crime, you know.

926
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,169
We pretty much made an alliance,

927
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,504
and that way we can manipulate

928
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,923
everybody and just get it done.

929
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,883
I know it sounds bad, bro, but

930
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,343
what am I going to do?

931
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:27,927
What am I going to do?

932
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,972
All right, come up here so I can

933
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,765
talk to you.

934
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:32,974
Come on.

935
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,268
Come on.

936
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,353
So we're switching it out, bro.

937
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,479
>> Oh, we're switching it out?

938
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,606
>> Yeah.

939
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:40,648
So Erica is going to go now, and

940
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,025
if and when the next time we

941
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,443
lose, Sylvia goes next.

942
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,444
>> Wouldn't you rather get rid

943
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,403
of Sylvia now?

944
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:46,529
>> No, no, because Erica is the

945
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,030
threat.

946
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,032
Sylvia is not.

947
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,033
>> Yeah, but we've got to get...

948
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:50,992
we need the strength is the

949
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,577
thing.

950
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,828
>> To be honest with you, I love

951
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:54,871
her to death, but I can't always

952
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:55,913
read her.

953
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:56,539
I don't always know where she's

954
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,291
coming from.

955
00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,500
>> So you'd rather have Sylvia

956
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,418
here?

957
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:01,419
>> No, Sylvia is next.

958
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:02,420
>> But we need to take out

959
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:03,504
Erica.

960
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,005
>> Oh, no.

961
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,007
>> She broke down today.

962
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,051
She... when we had those poles

963
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,302
in, when it didn't work, we

964
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,178
should have taken it out, she's

965
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,179
like, "No, do it again."

966
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,847
>> Mookie said "We're going to

967
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,182
vote Erica off."

968
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,934
I said, "Whoa!"

969
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:17,977
>> Things change real quick.

970
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:18,978
>> Yeah, they do.

971
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,813
>> Gee, I thought my days were

972
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:21,856
numbered here.

973
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:22,940
Bye.

974
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,442
If you have laundry, just bring

975
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,652
it to us.

976
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,195
And the one thing I learned, if

977
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,613
nothing else, is when you're in

978
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:29,781
a situation like this, a

979
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,366
survival situation, rule number

980
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:34,661
one-- you keep your head.

981
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:35,870
She was panicking and screaming

982
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:36,954
in my ear.

983
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:37,955
>> Explain to him, because he's

984
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:38,790
upset about it, and I don't

985
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:39,666
blame him.

986
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:40,625
>> She was completely in a

987
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,501
panic.

988
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:42,710
You have to stay calm as a team.

989
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,420
When one person's yelling and

990
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,964
screaming, we're all distracted.

991
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,424
>> It's nothing personal, bro.

992
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,509
>> It's just performance.

993
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:50,593
>> I know it's not personal.

994
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:51,469
I know it's not personal.

995
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:52,345
>> I'm telling you.

996
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,262
>> Do you want to keep losing or

997
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,013
no?

998
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:54,389
It's up to you.

999
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,807
>> Dude, do I look like I want

1000
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,557
to keep losing?

1001
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,266
>> I'm just asking you, bro.

1002
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:57,892
>> Do you want to ask me that

1003
00:32:57,975 --> 00:32:58,226
question again?

1004
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,769
>> Do you want to keep losing?

1005
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:00,561
Don't get all mad at me,

1006
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,354
brother.

1007
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:02,146
>> I'm not getting mad at you.

1008
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:02,772
>> You're bickering with me for

1009
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:03,064
no reason.

1010
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,899
>> I'm not bickering with you.

1011
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:05,733
Dude, I'm not bickering.

1012
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:06,734
>> Okay.

1013
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,694
>> You're upset, guy.

1014
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:08,778
>> I'm upset at the whole

1015
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:09,570
situation.

1016
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:10,363
>> Who would you rather it be?

1017
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,155
>> I'm upset about the whole

1018
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,115
situation, man.

1019
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,367
This sucks.

1020
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,455
>> You know, Erica lost her top.

1021
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,623
She completely blew her stack at

1022
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,166
the challenge today.

1023
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,460
And because she panicked,

1024
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,504
everybody saw it.

1025
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:27,130
And those who didn't trust her a

1026
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:30,091
lot now just want her gone,

1027
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,968
which in many ways I think is a

1028
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,344
mistake for the tribe.

1029
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,554
I don't think it's smart.

1030
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:35,513
I don't think it's smart.

1031
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:36,431
>> No, I don't think so, either,

1032
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,266
but then....

1033
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,183
>> Right, it's the majority.

1034
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,102
>> It's the majority.

1035
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,186
>> Okay, well...

1036
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,647
>> They've got the votes.

1037
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:45,189
They've got the votes.

1038
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,149
>> They have enough already?

1039
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,859
>> Yeah.

1040
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:48,735
>> Well, if they have enough

1041
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:49,694
already, let me put Sylvia, so I

1042
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:50,903
can be like, "I'm voting you

1043
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,072
because I don't like you."

1044
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,198
>> Okay, then that's cool.

1045
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,241
Then I'll vote for Sylvia, too.

1046
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:56,242
I'm playing the game.

1047
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,326
So is everybody else.

1048
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,286
You just have to play with what

1049
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,662
cards you're dealt.

1050
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:00,788
And right now I've got a really

1051
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,247
funky hand.

1052
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,374
Getting rid of Sylvia in a lot

1053
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,792
of ways would probably be good,

1054
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:05,960
you know, mental health for all

1055
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:07,462
of us.

1056
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,796
We were all fine before she

1057
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,922
showed up.

1058
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:10,923
We were actually all pretty

1059
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:11,924
tight before she showed up.

1060
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:12,383
>> Here's my question.

1061
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:16,137
How did you feel before she got

1062
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,597
here and after she got here?

1063
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,806
>> It was just kind of weird

1064
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,807
when she got here.

1065
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:20,850
>> That's what I mean.

1066
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:21,934
How did you feel before?

1067
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,060
>> I was cool.

1068
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,061
>> I thought before we were...

1069
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,021
>> We were all good with who we

1070
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,022
had, you know?

1071
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:26,647
>> I mean, I feel like we have

1072
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,316
the right combination between

1073
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,693
the girls and the guys that we

1074
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,653
have to make it through.

1075
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,946
>> Well, if we keep it together

1076
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,406
and if you and I keep together,

1077
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,074
then we'll be good.

1078
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:40,286
So we'll do it, and we'll...

1079
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,955
>> Okay.

1080
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,845
>> We get all the bad luck for

1081
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,972
losing, huh?

1082
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,016
>> Any more?

1083
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,060
>> If we landed in Bizarro World

1084
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:06,270
and we end up with a split vote

1085
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,231
of four for Erica and four for

1086
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,566
Sylvia, I think a couple of

1087
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,193
people's heads would explode.

1088
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,196
That would be a whole lot of

1089
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,114
people who have been lying to a

1090
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:17,698
whole lot of other people who

1091
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:18,366
are already lying to a whole lot

1092
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,158
of other people.

1093
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,077
Gives me cramps in my brain to

1094
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,496
think about.

1095
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,876
I'm just hoping that we're not

1096
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,253
in Bizarro World, and everybody

1097
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,213
keeps up with what they're

1098
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,256
planning to do, because, you

1099
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,465
know, in this game, you can't

1100
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,968
take anything at face value.

1101
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:56,946
>> PROBST: Mookie, back-to-back

1102
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,531
losses in winner-take-all

1103
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,116
challenges.

1104
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,409
How big of a hole is this tribe

1105
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:04,036
in right now?

1106
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,496
>> We're in a deep hole.

1107
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,123
We still have no fire, which

1108
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,499
means no water.

1109
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,208
We're running out of coconuts.

1110
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,919
We're tired.

1111
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:12,253
We're in a hole.

1112
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,463
We need to win.

1113
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,965
>> PROBST: Anthony, what do you

1114
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,300
think went wrong in today's

1115
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:18,551
challenge?

1116
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:19,969
>> I think there was too many

1117
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,637
people trying to help out in

1118
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,139
things where they should have

1119
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,140
backed off and let the original

1120
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:24,974
people who we thought were going

1121
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:25,850
to take care of it take care of

1122
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:26,767
it.

1123
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:27,852
>> PROBST: What I saw today,

1124
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:28,895
Erica, was you at one point

1125
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,354
screaming, "It goes like this!

1126
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,230
It goes like this!"

1127
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,983
Can that be an interference?

1128
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:34,609
>> A lot of people tried a lot

1129
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,445
of different pieces, and I was

1130
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,238
really trying to help out, give

1131
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,406
some input.

1132
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:41,657
I'm passionate about my team.

1133
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:42,950
I'm passionate about winning.

1134
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,243
And I feel like putting my input

1135
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,328
in wasn't such a bad thing, and

1136
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,663
all I asked them to do was to go

1137
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:48,998
back and try it again.

1138
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,458
>> PROBST: Sylvia, you divide

1139
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,711
these tribes, then you leave.

1140
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:55,338
You come back.

1141
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,839
Did you feel welcomed?

1142
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,508
>> Actually, I felt kind of like

1143
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:00,468
an outsider.

1144
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,179
They had the challenge itself,

1145
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:03,763
and then going back to camp,

1146
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:04,347
putting it together, and then

1147
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,473
having to come here, and that's

1148
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,517
a lot of bonding.

1149
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,811
So by the time I showed up, I

1150
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,481
felt I was on the outside.

1151
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,149
>> PROBST: Rocky, what was your

1152
00:37:15,232 --> 00:37:16,859
reaction to Sylvia coming back

1153
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:17,360
and joining the tribe?

1154
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,695
>> Sylvia is used to leading.

1155
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,072
She's used to, you know,

1156
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,198
dictating and telling people

1157
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:22,490
what to do.

1158
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,325
But whatever she tries to put

1159
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,493
across, she's doing it in a

1160
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,661
positive way.

1161
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,120
>> PROBST: Anthony, is what

1162
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:28,496
Rocky said true?

1163
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,207
Is Sylvia more of a leader?

1164
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,833
>> Bless you, Sylvia.

1165
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:33,459
You have a wonderful habit of

1166
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:36,128
kind of throwing out an idea and

1167
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,213
saying, "Let's do it," and not

1168
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,214
actually talking with anybody

1169
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:38,589
about doing it.

1170
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,967
>> PROBST: So, again, Sylvia,

1171
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:41,467
people are saying you're

1172
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,427
somewhat of a leader.

1173
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,137
Is this surprising to you?

1174
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,305
>> A little, because I came in

1175
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:47,765
late.

1176
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,141
So I could not be the leader

1177
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,434
just walking in off Exile Island

1178
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,519
and say, "Okay, everybody, clear

1179
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,561
the way.

1180
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,688
I'm leader."

1181
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,231
But I can offer ideas.

1182
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:56,774
An idea that's been gurgling in

1183
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:57,984
my head, which I haven't brought

1184
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,193
up to everybody, but tomorrow

1185
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,988
when we're fresh, when we wake

1186
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,531
up, is to assign a leader.

1187
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,117
>> PROBST: So Yau-Man, last

1188
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:06,742
tribal council it was "Let's get

1189
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,327
rid of the weakest member, make

1190
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,204
our tribe stronger."

1191
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,330
What's the criteria this time

1192
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,999
for voting somebody out?

1193
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,458
>> The criteria this time I

1194
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:19,338
think is to have a more cohesive

1195
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:22,091
tribe, to form a tribe where we

1196
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,467
get along better and be open to

1197
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,011
discussion and get rid of

1198
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,054
someone who is too vocal or too

1199
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,556
stubborn, who is too arrogant

1200
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,266
about things.

1201
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:32,268
>> PROBST: Okay, before we get

1202
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:33,769
to the vote, here are the rules

1203
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,312
about the hidden immunity idol.

1204
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,397
It is good through the final

1205
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,857
five.

1206
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,275
If you decide to play it, you

1207
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,526
will do so after the votes have

1208
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,445
been cast, but before I read

1209
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,696
them.

1210
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,239
You can also give it to someone

1211
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:45,656
else at that point.

1212
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,658
If the person who uses the idol

1213
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,285
does in fact have the highest

1214
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:50,661
number of votes, then the person

1215
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:51,454
with the next highest number of

1216
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:54,165
votes would be sent home.

1217
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,751
Okay, it is time to vote.

1218
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,378
Erica, you're up.

1219
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,100
>> I just can't read you

1220
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,060
anymore.

1221
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,061
And quite frankly you're the

1222
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,187
biggest threat right now.

1223
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,731
Sorry, baby.

1224
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,533
>> I'm voting for you because

1225
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,618
you've been a little bit pushy

1226
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,495
for me.

1227
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:35,164
I'm sorry.

1228
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:46,967
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1229
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,096
votes.

1230
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:00,815
>> PROBST: If anyone has the

1231
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:01,941
idol and wants to play it, now

1232
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:04,527
is the time to do so.

1233
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,570
Okay.

1234
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,614
Once the votes are read, the

1235
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:09,782
decision is final.

1236
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:10,825
The person voted out will be

1237
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:11,826
asked to leave the tribal

1238
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:12,827
council area immediately.

1239
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,162
I'll read the votes.

1240
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,705
First vote, Erica.

1241
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,587
Sylvia.

1242
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,550
Erica.

1243
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,969
Two vote Erica, one vote Sylvia.

1244
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,722
Sylvia.

1245
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,224
Two votes Sylvia, two votes

1246
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,351
Erica.

1247
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:40,813
Erica.

1248
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,815
That's three votes Erica.

1249
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:48,779
Erica.

1250
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,072
Four votes Erica, two votes

1251
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:54,743
Sylvia.

1252
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,245
Second person voted out of

1253
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:59,123
<i>Survivor: Fiji.</i>

1254
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:12,052
Erica, the tribe has spoken.

1255
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,764
It's time for you to go.

1256
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,901
Not much to say.

1257
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:27,610
This tribe has to find a way to

1258
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,196
win.

1259
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,405
Once again, you will be going

1260
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,490
back to camp without fire.

1261
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:33,866
Grab your stuff.

1262
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:34,700
Head on out.

1263
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,827
Good night.

1264
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:51,383
>> PROBST: stay tuned for scenes

1265
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,469
from our next episode.

1266
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:56,805
>> PROBST: Next time

1267
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,682
on<i> Survivor:</i>

1268
00:41:59,516 --> 00:42:00,392
Sylvia digs for immunity.

1269
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:01,310
>> I'm pretty sure I know where

1270
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:02,436
the idol is.

1271
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:03,604
>> Whoa!

1272
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:04,730
>> PROBST: Ravu sparks a flame.

1273
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:06,106
>> We're not going to die!

1274
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,233
>> We finally got the shot in

1275
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,317
the ass we needed.

1276
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,944
>> PROBST: And a Moto member is

1277
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,237
in trouble.

1278
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,196
>> He can't breathe.

1279
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,113
He was afraid.

1280
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:13,948
He said he didn't want to die in

1281
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,325
Fiji.

1282
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,914
>> I was very, very shocked by

1283
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,415
the vote tonight.

1284
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:23,916
It kind of hurts to get

1285
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,876
blindsided like that.

1286
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,127
I don't think it was a smart

1287
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,462
move to vote off somebody who

1288
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:29,463
was strong.

1289
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,547
When the next challenge comes

1290
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:31,173
around, I hope you guys win, but

1291
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,716
if you don't, I want you to

1292
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,801
think about voting me off and

1293
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:34,677
think about who you kept.

1294
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,720
And if you go home empty-handed

1295
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:37,721
maybe you should think about the

1296
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,807
decision that you made.
