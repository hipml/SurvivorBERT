>> They said, "Hey, Sarge,

194
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,299
they're calling for you."

195
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:41,924
They said "You've got to go with

196
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,301
them."

197
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,677
I got ready to go, and I took my

198
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,262
long pants off and got my socks

199
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,680
off and everything, got ready to

200
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,016
go.

201
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,019
Then all of a sudden, he hands

202
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:53,603
me a chief staff, and then he

203
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,396
puts the chief, uh, emblem

204
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,733
around my neck.

205
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,740
Then he turns around and gets in

206
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,201
his boat, and we're, like, "I

207
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:11,412
guess I'm not going with him."

208
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:13,831
>> What the hell's going

209
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,875
on today?

210
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,088
(<i> speaking native language</i> )

211
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:20,838
>> One chief.

212
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:21,422
>> Choose one chief.

213
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:21,756
>> One chief.

214
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,007
>> Choose one chief?

215
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:23,424
>> Scout.

216
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,133
>> Scout?

217
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:24,550
>> Scout.

218
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:24,801
>> Scout?

219
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,260
>> Scout's our chief.

220
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,888
>> Scout's our chief.

221
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:29,680
>> Scout.

222
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,599
She's definitely our chief.

223
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:34,268
She's the oldest.

224
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,019
She's the wisest.

225
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,229
I think it was obvious for all

226
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,188
of us.

227
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:37,688

00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:37,897
Uh-oh.

00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,315

00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,643
buddy, when it hit, man, them

299
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,810

about why chiefs were selected.

316
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,622
Sarge, Scout, over here.

317
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,043
Everybody else, drop your buffs.

>> PROBST: All right.

320
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:08,631
Let me explain how it's gonna

321
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,675
work.

322
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,510
One of you two is going to

323
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,553
divide these two tribes into two

324
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,389
new tribes, mixing up the men

325
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,265
and the women.

326
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,724
Because there is one extra

327
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:19,976
woman, one woman will not be

328
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:20,851
chosen.

329
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:21,644
We'll deal with that later.

330
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,063
Once the tribes have been

331
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,815
divided, the other leader will

332
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,692
choose which tribe they want to

333
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,693
take back with them to their

334
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:29,819
beach.

335
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,154
To make things fair, we'll rock,

336
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,323
paper, scissor to see who gets

337
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,325
to divide the tribes and who

338
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,410
gets to choose.

339
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,662
>> One, two, three.

00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,330
>> PROBST: Paper covers rock.

341
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,082
Sarge, do you want to divide, or

342
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,417
do you want to choose?

343
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,334
>> I'll choose.

00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,335
>> PROBST: It's on you.

345
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,336

347
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,171
Make sure you divide them as

00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:49,797
evenly as possible, alternating

349
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,008
between men and women to make

350
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,801
sure it doesn't hurt you later

351
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,636
when Sarge chooses which tribe

352
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,347
he wants.

It is for reward.

00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,992
Here's how it works.

431
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,577
One tribe member at a time is

432
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,703
going to dive off the platform,

433

435
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,750
There are 13 markers in total.

436
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,335
Deepest marker is 30 feet down.

437
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,712
The deeper you go, the harder it

438
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:35,504
gets.

439
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,339
Bring it back to the platform

440
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:37,882
and get it up on the board.

441
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,050
This is timed game.

442
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,302

John!

We're tied at eight.

Both tribes tied at eight.

Next marker that comes up will

00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:37,324
Both have been under a long

It's up to Ami.

If she's comes up with a marker,

If she doesn't, Lopevi wins.

Amazing effort, guys.

610
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,953
Yasur, you have a new tribe, and

611
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,830
for some of you, a new home.

612
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,332
Head on back to shore.

613

Lopevi, congratulations on your

all the beer you can drink.

00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,552
Good chance to get to know each

other.

624
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,429
Head on in.

eating greens and plantains,

634
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:17,341
this tastes like gold.

635
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,342
>> Great job today, guys.

636
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:18,717
>> Let's do it.

our new tribe mates.

642
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,767
We got rid of some people, and

643
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,310
now, um, it seems like

644
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,103
everybody's kind of happy.

Yeah, you got the summer.

>> Awesome!

650
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,279
I can relate to this guy.

651
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:39,655
I'm loving this.

652
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,406
I've got something to talk

653
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,240
about. Yes!

654
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,367
I love my other tribe.

655
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,993
Am I going to miss 'em?

656
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,162
Oh, hell, yes.

657
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:47,704
But yet I fit in better with

658
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,581
these guys up here.

659
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,374
I'm already kicking with these

660
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,833
guys where I was never able to

661
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:52,417
kick with the girls.

662
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,335
Do you take yours in comp when

663
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,379
you get overtime?

664
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,463
>> Yeah, oh, yeah.

665
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,714
I max out every year.

666
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,423
>> That is wild, dude!

Another guy that works for

668

highway transportation.

669
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:02,761
You know, this is just, you

670
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,389
know... things are clicking.

674
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:14,523
awesome.

00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,608
>> I'm all buzzed up.

676
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,359
I mean, not from the beer, but

677
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,361
just buzzed up from the change

678
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,362
and, you know, the evolution

679
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,613
here.

680
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,244
I'm sure there's underlying

00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,247
I mean, two women, the rest of

683
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,581
the men, so are they going to

684
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,833
try to pick us off?

685
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:33,417
I don't know, so me and Twila

686
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,961
are trying to weasel our way in

687
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,296
there pretty tight.

688
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,101
>> As soon as the

689
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,477
tribes started to swap, I was

690
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,353
psyched, because I knew that my

691
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,521
odds in this game had

692
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,565
drastically increased.

693
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,566
I was starting to get scared

694
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,400
because the guys' alliance was

695
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,401
really tight, and I wasn't a

696
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,445
member of it.

697
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,571
But the bottom line is now that

698
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,363
it's broken up, that's all the

699
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,907
work that I was trying to do is

700
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,953
break it up.

701
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:10,996
I'm just psyched.

702
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:11,580
I mean, our tribe's looking

703
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:12,372
really good.

704
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,373
Compared to the other tribe, I

705
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,292
think we really have an

706
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,334
advantage.

707
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,141
>> We had a tribe swap of

708
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,476
sorts today.

709
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,769
>> Welcome to our shack.

710
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:34,978
>> We lost the reward

711
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:35,979
challenge, which was

712
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:36,605
disappointing, but, you know, we

713
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,523
don't even feel the loss right

714
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,816
now, because everyone's kind of

715
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,609
excited that there are new faces

716
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:40,859
around.

717
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,652
>> Vittles on.

718
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,237
>> Thanks.

719
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,614
>> Go ahead.

720
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,115
Isn't too bad, huh, guys?

721
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,825
>> Thank you, ladies, so much.

722
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:49,993
>> Yeah, you're making

723
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:50,702
us feel very welcome.

724
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:51,912
>> Well, you're part of

725
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:52,913
our tribe now.

726
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,331
>> I thought it'd feel

727
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,332
kind of strange, but this is all

728
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:55,999
right.

729
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,001
That's the best meal I've had

730
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:58,585
since I've been here.

731
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,504
By far.

>> Get out!

735
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:04,966
>> We've been chewing

736
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,967
sticks of sugar.

737
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,052
>> I've been dying for

738
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,053
sugared stuff.

739
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,262
I think I'm really going to

740
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,639
enjoy living over here with the

741
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:11,640

swallow it.

744
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,060
>> You chew it.

745
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,269
Chew it and spit it out.

746
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,896
>> Being in a tribe with

747
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:18,647
a bunch of women, it does make

00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,149
you nervous, because one wrong

749
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,359
move, buddy, and they'll vote

750
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:22,609
you out.

751
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,945
Don't think they won't.

752
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:25,487
I guess you could say I'm

753
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,156
sweating like a prostitute in

754
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,699
church, I guess you could say.

You're the man.

759
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:37,749
These guys right now seem pretty

00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,625
willing to please.

761
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,544
Right now they're just like

00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:41,545
whatever it takes to get it

763
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,546
done.

764
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:43,922
>> We going to show them

765
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:44,923
how to do the coconut?

766
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,133
Hey, did y'all see how...?

767
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,259
>> Why?

768
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,343
>> Huh?

769
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:49,386
>> Why?

770
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:58,270
>> Why what?

771
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:58,895
We've been showing the guys all

772
00:23:58,979 --> 00:23:59,646
kinds of stuff, and I said,

773
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,731
"Oh, I'm going to show them how

774
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:02,732
to crack the coconut."

775
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,109
Ami was, like, "Why?"

776
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,235
Because to show them how to do

777
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:05,694
it-- it's cool.

778
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,071
Well, why would you want to do

779
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,322
that?

780
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,407
You know, I'm like...

781
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:10,699
why not?

782
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,826
>> You want to teach them,

783
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:13,952
teach them.

784
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,745
>> I think it's kind of

785
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,290
cool.

786
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,083
>> I was so happy that Rory

787
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,835
and Bubba started lifting stuff

788
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:22,878
and moving stuff and doing

789
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:23,461
stuff.

790
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,380
What I got irritated with was I

791
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:27,215
saw a little bit of our bond

792
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:27,632
disappear.

793
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,009
The girls were so excited to

794
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,010
show them everything.

795
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,386
I just don't think it's really

796
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:32,637
that important that we show them

797
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:33,054
all of our secrets.

798
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,681
We're definitely still five

799
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:35,682
women strong.

800
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:37,100
That's not going to change; at

801
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:37,726
least on my end it's not going

802
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,518
to change.

803
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,562
I'm sticking by the ladies.

804
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,314
So, they really need to prove

805
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,356
themselves.

806
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,442
Otherwise, they're out of here.

807
00:24:45,525 --> 00:25:06,755
There we go.

808
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,090
>> PROBST: Okay, let's get to

809
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:09,633
today's immunity challenge.

810
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,551
First things first.

811
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:14,346
Scout.

812
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,311
>> Chris, think about

813
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,563
the merge.

814
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:24,564
>> PROBST: Immunity-- back up

815
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,483
for grabs.

816
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,859
Let me explain how it's going to

817
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:28,235
work.

818
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,736
You're going to race into the

819
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,404
jungle, collecting pieces to

820
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,948
build an outrigger canoe.

821
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,449
Both tribes will start with your

822
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:35,283
canoe on the beach.

823
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,910
Two tribe members will go into

824
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:37,702
the jungle, untie the frame,

825
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,621
bring it back.

826
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,248
The next two tribe members will

827
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,749
go deeper into the jungle, untie

828
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,668
two paddles, bring them back.

829
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:47,128
The last two tribe members will

830
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,672
go even further into the jungle,

831
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,090
untie the outrigger, bring it

832
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:50,590
back.

833
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,592
Once you've gathered all the

834
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:53,885
pieces on the beach, you can

835
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,512
begin to assemble the outrigger.

836
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:56,888
Two tribe members will then

837
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:57,764
paddle out, retrieve the tribe

838
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,600
flag, come back to the beach.

839
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,560
Your outrigger must hit the

840
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:03,979
final marker pole on your way

841
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:04,187
back.

842
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,231
First tribe with all six tribe

843
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,774
members and their tribe flag on

844
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,026
the mat wins immunity.

845
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,237
The losers-- Tribal Council, and

846
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,281
this game will be over tonight

847
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,532
for somebody.

848
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:16,658
Yasur, you have one extra tribe

849
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,118
member, got to sit somebody out.

850
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,452
Bubba sat out yesterday.

851
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,578
Who's sitting out today?

852
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:20,954
>> I'll sit out.

853
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:21,746
>> PROBST: Scout, you're going

854
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,790
to sit this one out.

855
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,166
Everybody else take your spots,

856
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,253
wait for my go.

857
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,213
Here we go, for immunity.

858
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,841
Survivors ready.

859
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:33,717
Go!

860
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,228
Sarge and Twila attacking the

861
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,564
knots.

862
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,608
Bubba with the first knot

863
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:50,859
undone.

864
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,027
>> Pull, pull, pull it out.

865
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,194
You got to start pulling the

866
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,195
other one.

867
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,405
>> PROBST: One knot left in the

868
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:56,031
center; Twila working on that.

869
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,825
Dead even.

870
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:02,287
Lopevi has their frame.

871
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,455
>> Bring it down here,

872
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:04,456
Sarge!

873
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,707
>> PROBST: Yasur right behind.

874
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,666
Bubba taking it all.

875
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,294
>> Pick it up.

876
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,713
Come on, go, go!

877
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,259
>> Hit the mat, hit the

878
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:16,426
mat.

879
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,136
Ami, you hit the mat, too.

880
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,679
>> PROBST: Next two-- go, go,

881
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,056
go!

882
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,312
Chad and Julie with a bit of a

883
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,855
head start on the paddles.

884
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,525
Leann and Eliza right behind.

885
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,985
>> Come on, let's get those

886
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:34,986
oars back!

887
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,488
>> PROBST: Julie, almost there.

888
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:37,572
>> Got it.

889
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:38,198
>> PROBST: Yasur, making up a

890
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,783
lot of time.

891
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,368
Leann has hers free.

892
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,827
She's helping Eliza.

893
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:46,289
We're dead even.

894
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,292
Chad and Julie are out.

895
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,252
Leann and Eliza right behind.

896
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,754
>> Come on, ladies, let's go!

897
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,422
>> Come on, Julie, come on!

898
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,049
>> Get ready.

899
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,009
>> Go, go, go.

900
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,178
>> PROBST: Next two-- go!

901
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,847
Leann and Eliza right behind.

902
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,766
Yasur's still in it.

903
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:05,975
Next two-- go!

904
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:17,987
Final piece.

905
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,906
>> Come on, dude.

906
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,074
>> PROBST: John working his

907
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:21,574
knots.

908
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,742
Rory right behind working on

909
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:23,284
his.

910
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,869
John with a bit of a lead.

911
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:25,870
Rory trying to make up some

912
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:26,830
ground.

913
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,749
Still very tight.

914
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,210
John getting very close.

915
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:35,964
Rory falling a bit behind.

916
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,632
Rory going to have to make up a

917
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,175
lot of ground for Yasur.

918
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,468
>> Do it.

919
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,761
>> PROBST: John very close.

920
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,263
>> Lower it down, okay?

921
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:43,930
As soon as my end touches the

922
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,890
ground, come on down.

923
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,058
>> PROBST: Chris and John

924
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,476
getting the outrigger portion.

925
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,562
Chris untying the last knot.

926
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:51,563
John and Chris have the

927
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:51,980
outrigger.

928
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:52,981
They're heading back to the

929
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:53,690
beach.

930
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:54,858
>> Steady pace; I'm right

931
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:55,859
behind you.

932
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:56,860
>> PROBST: Yasur losing a lot of

933
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,194
time.

934
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,529
>> Pace, pace, pace.

935
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:00,864
>> They are not even close.

936
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:01,948
>> PROBST: Go, Rory, you're in

937
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:02,532
this.

938
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:03,158
Lopevi still needs to assemble

939
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:03,867
their canoe.

940
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,620
>> Hey, Chad, ready?

941
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:07,996
>> On the side.

942
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,081
>> Start assembling.

943
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,084
>> Over, in.

944
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,419
>> I got it.

945
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:15,420
>> PROBST: Lopevi with a big

946
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,338
lead.

947
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,716
>> Come on, Rory!

948
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,137
>> Come on, let's go.

949
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,388
>> PROBST: Rory's dragging it.

950
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,639
A lot of ground to make up.

951
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,892
Start assembling.

952
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:31,311
Ooh, careful.

954
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:32,937
out.

955

JEFF: Both tribes working on

956
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:35,523
their outriggers.

957
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,151
Lopevi with a big lead.

very well together, making up

961
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,032
some time.

962
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,327
Lopevi has theirs together.

963
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:47,994
>> Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

964
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,913
Get in.

965
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,539
Get in, Chad.

966
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:55,210
We can't go no farther.

967
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,794
>> Go; push the other

968
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:57,045
way, Chad.

969
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,047
I'll turn it, I'll turn it;

970
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,131
we're fine.

971
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,299
Keep pushing, Chad.

>> PROBST: Chad and John working

973
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,843
together out to retrieve the

tribe flag.

975
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,596
The big lead on Yasur.

976
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:07,847
>> You ready?

977
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,015
>> PROBST: Get out there.

978
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:13,686

>> Go.

982
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,317
Head the right direction.

983
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,318
>> PROBST: Yasur with a terrible

984
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:23,821
push-off.

985
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:24,113
>> Oh, man.

986
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,407
>> PROBST: They pushed their

987
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,408
tribe completely the wrong

988
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,201
direction.

989
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:28,993
>> We're going backwards.

990
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:29,994
>> PROBST: Panic by Yasur in a

991
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:30,870
bad push-off.

992
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:31,246
>> Turn it around.

993
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,081
>> PROBST: Let's go, Yasur.

994
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,958
Pick it up.

995
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,459
>> We've got to go from

996
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,544
that side, all right?

997
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:38,795
>> Straighten it out.

998
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,463
>> Don't worry, man,

999
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,714
just paddle!

1000
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:42,340
>> PROBST: Lopevi's now all over

1001
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,049
the map.

1002
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,968
>> Go, go!

1003
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:48,846
>> Stroke, stroke.

1004
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,682
>> Grab it, Chad!

1005
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:51,766
There you go.

1006
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:51,933
Yeah!

1007
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:52,934
>> PROBST: Lopevi has their

1008
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,811
tribe flag.

1009
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,230
Yasur's closing the gap.

1010
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,487
>> Keep it going!

1011
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:05,697
>> There you go.

1012
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,698

tribe flag.

1014

1015
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,076
>> PROBST: They're around the

1016
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:10,535
buoy and heading back.

1017
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:11,035
>> Row!

1018

1019
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,038
the finish.

1021
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,249
side, bro.

1022
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:17,667
When you paddle that way, it

1023
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,668
turns, man.

1024
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:19,877
>> PROBST: Lopevi heading the

1025
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:20,878
wrong way.

1026
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:21,170
>> Oh, whoa.

1027
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,839
>> PROBST: Yasur's still in

1028
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:23,423
this.

1029
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,300
>> Chad, use the bottom

1030
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,385
to turn, use the bottom to turn!

1031
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,095
>> PROBST: Lopevi's got to hit

1032
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,179
their flag.

1033
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,025
>> Get out, get out, get out!

1034
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,697
>> PROBST: Lopevi wins immunity!

1035
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,367
(<i> cheering</i> )

1036
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,998
Lopevi-- congratulations.

1037
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,834
Nobody going home tonight.

1038
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:00,793
>> Yeah.

1039
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,503
>> Yeah. Yeah.

1040
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,796
>> PROBST: Yasur, not sure what

1041
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,797
went on out there.

1042
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,007
Rory, you lost a lot of time on

1043
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,133
the knots.

1044
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,760
Some of the worst paddling I've

1045
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:09,093
ever seen.

1046
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,011
Somebody's going to pay for it

1047
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,804
tonight.

1048
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:12,347
See you at Tribal Council.

1049
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,140
Head back to camp.

1050
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,330
>> Tribal Council is coming up

1051
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,248
and Bubba and I are both...

1052
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,000
it's very, very apparent

1053
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:44,754
that one of the two of us has

1054
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,506
got to go.

1055
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,299
I feel the women of Yasur are

1056
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,094
going to vote as a solid block.

1057
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,429
I feel extremely vulnerable.

1058
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,139
The only thing I can do is

1059
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,141
assume the worst and hope for

1060
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,143
the best and pray to God that

1061
00:32:59,227 --> 00:32:59,560
I'm here tomorrow.

1062
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,061
>> What did we look like

1063
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,979
out there?

1064
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:02,563
Did we look like total idiots,

1065
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:07,568
or what?

1066
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,569
I'm annoyed as hell with Bubba

1067
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,404
right now.

1068
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,197
The second that we arrived at

1069
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,115
our challenge, I see Bubba

1070
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,534
making signals to Chris.

1071
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:15,159
He was communicating completely,

1072
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,286
and Chris was nodding like,

1073
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,204
"Yep, that's right.

1074
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,915
Yep, that's right."

1075
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:21,457
Bubba was not helping me one

1076
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,458
bit.

1077
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,084
>> No.

1078
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,085
>> During the entire time,

1079
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,086
I...

1080
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,088
>> Was he trying to tell...

1081
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:27,296
>> Yes.

1082
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,590
I saw him talking to Chris.

1083
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,175
I just watched it happen the

1084
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,176
whole time.

1085
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,721
It was disgusting.

1086
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,096
People will...

1087
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:35,930
people will get

1088
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:36,764
themselves kicked out.

1089
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:37,765
You don't have kick them out.

1090
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,558
They'll get themselves kicked

1091
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:39,392
out.

1092
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,393
I don't know exactly how the

1093
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,811
other girls are voting, but I

1094
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,980
definitely have my vote.

1095
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,273
Bubba is not part of the tribe.

1096
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,274
He's making plans with the other

1097
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:46,441
team.

1098
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,942
That's...

1099
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:48,443
Can you see Michael Jordan

1100
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,111
whispering over to the other

1101
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,487
team what their next play is?

1102
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,364
Hell, no.

1103
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,449
He is not on our team.

1104
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,366
He's out.

1105
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:55,783
I'm done with him.

1106
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,118
>> What do you guys want

1107
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:00,830
to eat?

1108
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,999
>> When we got to the

1109
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,167
immunity challenge and I saw my

1110
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,127
old tribe mates, out of a-a

1111
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,337
desperate chance, trying to

1112
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,047
communicate with Chris, I was

1113
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,175
trying to mouth "merge" for

1114
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,801
him to think of the merge.

1115
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,511
Because if, uh, they win all

1116
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,096
these immunity challenges, the

1117
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,514
women are going to have the

1118
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:19,223
advantage during the merge, and

1119
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,642
they're going to pick the guys

1120
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,643
off one by one.

1121
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,644
But, who knows, I may have got

1122
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,645
caught with my hands in the

1123
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,646
cookie jar.

1124
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,647
>> Losing sure does take it

1125
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,648
out of you.

1126
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,649
>> It took the wind out

1127
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,693
of my sails.

1128
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,445
If y'all choose me, will you

1129
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:33,780
tell me before I go?

1130
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:34,238
>> I don't know.

1131
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,282
You have to ask the boss.

1132
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,575
>> I just said, "If you

1133
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,117
choose...

1134
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,243
could you tell me

1135
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,829
before I go?"

1136
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,000
>> Ask everybody, you'll find...

1137
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:46,459
everyone knows.

1138
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:46,793
>> I didn't...

1139
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,461
I didn't say that.

1140
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:49,545
I just said if y'all choose I'd

1141
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,671
like to know before I go.

1142
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,756
I just don't want to get

1143
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:52,507
blindsided, you know what I'm

1144
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,341
saying?

1145
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,009
You know, that's all I ask.

1146
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:56,177
I wasn't asking for you to vote

1147
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,303
either way.

1148
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:58,221
I just would like to know.

1149
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:01,390
>> Yeah, no, I hear you.

1150
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,562
>> Ami noticed Bubba

1151
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,689
making, uh, hand signals and

1152
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,775
working with the other team

1153
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:11,400
trying to signal them something,

1154
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,069
so, how do you feel about that,

1155
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:13,903
little one?

1156
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,404
>> I'm worried that we're

1157
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,697
shooting ourselves in the

1158
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,698
foot, you know.

1159
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,367
>> Yeah.

1160
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,660
>> I just think it's

1161
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:21,160
going to be...

1162
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:21,536
I just think it's

1163
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,161
going to get harder.

1164
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,663
I don't know.

1165
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:24,288
>> Okay.

1166
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,206
>> It's definitely

1167
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,208
dangerous to vote the guys off.

1168
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,501
These challenges are going to be

1169
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:29,210
physical and we are going to

1170
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,336
need their strength.

1171
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,546
I don't want to vote off Bubba

1172
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,505
or Rory.

1173
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,714
We like them both a lot.

1174
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,799
I think we could...

1175
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:35,466
potentially,

1176
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,676
like, we're already down four

1177
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:37,760
guys to two.

1178
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:38,386
Now we're going to be down to

1179
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,596
just one guy on our team and

1180
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,973
then we're going to have really

1181
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:42,974
physical challenges and...

1182
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:43,724
What?

1183
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,350
>> We're not going to kick

1184
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:49,272
one of us off.

1185
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:06,831
>> Thank you, Lord, for

1186
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:07,832
everything that you've done for

1187
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:08,708
us.

1188
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,709
Thank you for all the

1189
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,127
opportunities that you've given

1190
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,211
us and thank you for the

1191
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,713
beautiful days on Vanuatu.

1192
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:14,255
Thank you, Lord, thank you.

1193
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,424
Amen.

1194
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,634
You know I love you, brother.

1195
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,345
>> I love you, too, bro.

1196
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,786
>> PROBST: Welcome to Tribal

1197
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:46,913
Council.

1198
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,080
Let's go back to when we

1199
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:48,915
switched.

1200
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,374
Lisa, after being women and men

1201
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,417
this long, is this truly one

1202
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,127
new tribe now?

1203
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,712
>> Well, we've tried to

1204
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:55,379
make them as welcome in the

1205
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,798
tribe, and we actually have

1206
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:58,424
enjoyed having two men around.

1207
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,801
Feels like they have been with

1208
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,345
us forever, and I've personally

1209
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,971
enjoyed it a lot.

1210
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,097
>> PROBST: Leann, what's the

1211
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:05,973
reaction on a split?

1212
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:06,557
Is it, "All right, this is the

1213
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,601
tribe I'm on now and who knows

1214
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:09,477
what's coming next?"

1215
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,311
>> I think it's really

1216
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,772
difficult after 11 days of

1217
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:14,357
bonding with all these women,

1218
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,067
and I'm not going to lie, I

1219
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,567
haven't made the switch.

1220
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,819
>> PROBST: So it's still men

1221
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,071
versus women for you?

1222
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:20,404
>> Yes, it is.

1223
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,865
>> PROBST: Ami, are they equal

1224
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,575
members, even though there are

1225
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,826
five women and two men?

1226
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,328
>> This morning I thought

1227
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:27,745
we were one team.

1228
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:29,038
I was excited about the

1229
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:29,956
challenge.

1230
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:30,498
I was ready to go, and I see

1231
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,667
Bubba making signals to Chris,

1232
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,127
and the second I saw that

1233
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,129
signal, I'm like, we're not a

1234
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,047
team; this is not a team here.

1235
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,340
That... I-I saw it happen.

1236
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,759
>> PROBST: So, Bubba, at today's

1237
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,427
immunity challenge, you tried to

1238
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,428
get a signal or you gave a

1239
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:44,679
signal?

1240
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,806
>> I was trying to get a

1241
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,265
signal to let me know if they

1242
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,266
were going to play it to win or

1243
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,268
they were going to strategize

1244
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,268
trying to get more men into

1245
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,229
the merge.

1246
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:53,854
>> PROBST: What were you hoping

1247
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,064
to get back?

1248
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:55,648
>> Just a...

1249
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:56,941
a thumbs up

1250
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:57,900
or a smile or a wave--

1251
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:58,651
something.

1252
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,069
I took a chance.

1253
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,028
It was a big gamble.

1254
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,029
>> We had all intentions

1255
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,197
on winning.

1256
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,532
>> And you weren't going to

1257
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,158
be the one that we had picked,

1258
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,744
if we did lose, to go.

1259
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:09,954
>> PROBST: Rory, a little

1260
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,038
worried on your end, then?

1261
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,040
>> The fact of the matter

1262
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,834
is, Jeff, the only thing that

1263
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,711
could have changed our fate is

1264
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,045
for Yasur to have won immunity

1265
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,130
today.

1266
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,339
That's the only thing that was

1267
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,551
going to stop one of us two from

1268
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,510
leaving tonight.

1269
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:25,428
>> PROBST: Ami, is it a little

1270
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,430
difficult for you to know you're

1271
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,515
going to sacrifice both these

1272
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:30,975
guys when they really didn't do

1273
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:31,559
anything other than end up on

1274
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,560
the wrong end of the buff?

1275
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,937
>> Yeah, it's a little

1276
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,689
difficult for me, but I'm glad--

1277
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:37,481
sorry to say this, guys-- but

1278
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,109
I'm glad that we have them and

1279
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,861
it's not Twila or Jules that are

1280
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,154
going home tonight.

1281
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,072
>> PROBST: Bubba, so why should

1282
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,157
they keep you?

1283
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,534
>> Because I-I busted my

1284
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,618
butt trying to win.

1285
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:50,411
I almost drowned when I was a

1286
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,121
kid in the ocean.

1287
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,205
I never set foot in the ocean

1288
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,206
till I got here.

1289
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,499
Six weeks I came here, I learned

1290
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,584
how to swim.

1291
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,543
So you know me getting my butt

1292
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:00,129
in that boat was making a big

1293
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,714
step, so I am a team player.

1294
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,632
It's just, I made a mistake.

1295
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:04,759
If you need to win challenges

1296
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:05,926
and stuff, you know beyond a

1297
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,219
shadow of a doubt, I'm going to

1298
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,346
bust my butt to do it.

1299
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,346
>> PROBST: Rory, why Bubba and

1300
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,181
not you?

1301
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,932
>> These women know where

1302
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,684
my heart is, and they know that

1303
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,394
if anybody is capable of being

1304
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:18,147
110% part of this team, it's

1305
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,190
me.

1306
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,358
I go down with my ship, and if I

1307
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,360
can't break into that union of

1308
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,945
women, of the sisters, then I'm

1309
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,280
going to take my lumps.

1310
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:26,781
I'm man enough to do that.

1311
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,783
>> I just wanted to say

1312
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:29,075
when I...

1313
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,284
initially divided up

1314
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:31,660
the teams, there were three guys

1315
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,287
that I really wanted to play the

1316
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,538
game with, and these are two of

1317
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,500
them, and, uh, the game ain't

1318
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:41,212
over till the fat lady sings.

1319
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,963
>> PROBST: It is time to vote.

1320
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,300
Leann, you're up.

1321
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:58,729
>> Bubba, you know you're

1322
00:39:58,813 --> 00:39:59,522
my brother.

1323
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,190
We were just put in an awkward

1324
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,733
situation where it was going to

1325
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:06,278
be you or I.

1326
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,410
>> Rory, I picked you,

1327
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:18,249
and, uh, go get him, girls.

1328
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:24,964
>> Sorry, Bubba, you know

1329
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:28,634
why.

1330
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,106
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1331
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,567
votes.

1332
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,868
Once the votes are read, the

1333
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:54,618
decision is final.

1334
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:55,202
The person voted out will be

1335
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:55,703
asked to leave the Tribal

1336
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,830
Council area immediately.

1337
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:00,249
I'll read the votes.

1338
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,084
First vote...

1339
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,794
Travis-- Bubba.

1340
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,215
Rory.

1341
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,800
One vote Bubba, one vote Rory.

1342
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,054
Bubba.

1343
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,223
That's two Bubba.

1344
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:19,935
Bubba.

1345
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:23,272
That's three votes Bubba.

1346
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:23,898
The sixth person voted out of

1347
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:24,607
<i>Survivor: Vanuatu...</i>

1348
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,275
Bubba.

1349
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,026
That's four votes.

1350
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:27,818
That's enough.

1351
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,988
You need to bring me your torch.

1352
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,623
Bubba, the tribe has spoken.

1353
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:43,167
It's time for you to go.

1354
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,587
>> Peace out, y'all.

1355
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,137
>> PROBST: Well, Yasur is now

1356
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,138
down to six members, same number

1357
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,389
as Lopevi.

1358
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,475
The question is, will the women

1359
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:00,267
stay united?

1360
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,393
Will there be a merge?

1361
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:02,269
A lot of questions, a lot of

1362
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,354
game left.

1363
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,605
Grab your torches, head back to

1364
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:05,481
camp.

>> PROBST: Rory makes a daring

1373
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,208
move.

1374
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:24,708
>> ...continue to slave

1375
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,877
around camp if I do not have a

1376
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:27,878
shot at making it through Tribal

1377
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:28,879
Council.

1378
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:29,713
My speech was so cheesy, I

1379
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,757
couldn't even believe I was

1380
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,758
saying it.

1381
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,218
>> PROBST: And the clothes come

1382
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:34,843
off at Lopevi.

1383
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,011
>> I think the coed thing

1384
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,179
is working really well for our

1385
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,765
tribe now.

1386
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,437
>> I had a great time

1387
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,272
playing.

1388
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,273
Got in trouble throwing a little

1389
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,274
signal.

1390
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,483
I think the Yankees are going to

1391
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,901
give me a job to work first base

1392
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,278
so I can send some signals.

1393
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,779
It really shocked me how close

1394
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,406
you can become with a person

1395
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,074
when you're with them that long.

1396
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,535
And one thing I learned, the

1397
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:02,121
important thing is what you have

1398
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:04,248
in life and that's my family.
