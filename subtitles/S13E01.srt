very unique tribes:

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,535
Asian American, Caucasian,

37
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,330

own island.

the tribes were split right

opportunity, because I think

101
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,096
it's wonderful that there's more

102
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:23,972

Uh, at the same time, I'm a

104
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:25,890
little bit worried that it might

105
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:26,975
play out to caricatures and

106
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,227
stereotypes, so I don't know,

107
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,019
it'll be interesting to see

108

122
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,231
When the tribes were divided, I

123
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:17,233
thought, what an advantage for

124
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:17,859
the Hispanics.

125
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:18,526

126
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,737
Caribbean or South American

00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,362

128
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,740

00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,034
this tropical setting.

00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,785

00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,580
>> One, two, three.

132
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,582
>> This is a unique opportunity

133
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,083
to represent our community in a

positive way.

135
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,377
I mean, we just show that we

136
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,963
work hard and we play hard.

137
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:39,881
I think we're going to go

138
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:40,173
pretty far.

139
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,216
>> Building stuff, it should be

140
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,177
the-the shelter, plus I know how

141
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,261
to make a toilet.

142
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,346

143
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:46,929
>> Well, no, first I'll just

144
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:47,472
explain it to you, and then

145
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,182
we'll all know what... well,

146
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,183
we'll be on, like, on the same

147
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:50,767

148
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,642
We'll all have the blueprint.

>> Do you want them with us?

150
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,311
>> Billy said that he can chop

151
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,771
things down and make a hut and

152
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:55,396
make a toilet, and I was

153
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,398
really fired up.

154
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,858
You know, I mean, I didn't want

155
00:05:58,941 --> 00:05:59,609
to judge him on his appearance.

156
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,320
I mean, he's out of shape.

157
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,073
>> It was kind of obvious to

158
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:05,698
me, just from the way Billy cut

159
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,826
the bamboo, that he didn't

160
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,871
really know exactly what he was

161
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:12,497
doing.

162
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,665
>> See, look-- boom, perfect.

163
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:14,999
>> All right.

164
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,584
>> I had to kind of take over

165
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,960
and build the shelter.

166
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:18,503
I'm kind of trying to guide

167
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,671
things without trying to step

168
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:21,756
into a position of being a

169
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,049
leader because I don't want

170
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:23,716
to... I do not want that to

171
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,717
happen.

172
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,468
>> You guys want some coconuts?

173
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,595
>> Yes.

174
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:28,346
>> Yeah!

175
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:28,930
>> Oh, you want to climb it?

176
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,723
>> Try that.

177
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,850

179
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,436

181
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:36,646

182

183
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:39,065
Watch out.

184
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:42,318
>> Okay, go ahead.

185
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,319
>> Good.

186
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:43,861
>> Awesome.

187
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:44,487
>> I mean, he may not be very

188
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,156
big, but he's an athlete, and

189
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,032
he's somebody who'd be pretty

190
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:48,950
good at this game.

191
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,451
>> Really good job, man.

192
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,744
>> Good job, dude.

193
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:52,745
>> I think we're all going to

194
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:53,579
be able to work as a team, and

195
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,747
I think that we have the

196
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,166
strongest tribe out of anybody

197
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,334
else.

198
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:58,960
As long as we stay fed and happy

199
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,379
with each other, then we're

200
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,296
going to be able to stay really

201
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,048
strong.

202
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:04,423
>> Ay!

203
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,675
>> Salud!

204
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:06,384
>> Ay! Ay!

205
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,011
>> Ay!

206
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,641
>> We did most of the work.

207
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:25,695
>> I'm not a first-generation

208
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,446
American.

209
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,531
I'm not even an immigrant.

210
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,657
I'm a refugee.

211
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,325
I came, uh, after the Vietnam

212
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,451
War as a refugee.

213
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,453
I'm a survivor in that way.

214
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,080
I've survived the Vietnam War.

215
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,832
I can survive this.

216
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,629
The Puka Tribe is actually an

217
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:44,589
advantage.

218
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,382
We fly under the radar.

219
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:49,135
Nobody suspects these little

220
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,928
people with slanted eyes to see

221
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,680
anything or to be strong enough

222
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:56,642
to do anything or maybe don't

223
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,019
even speak English.

224
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,688
People always underestimate the

225
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:04,567
Asians.

226
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,026
>> What's your name?

227
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,152
>> Yul.

228
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,945
>> Yul, I'm Cao Boi.

229
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:08,696
>> Brad.

230
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:09,530
>> Brad?

231
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:09,989
>> Yeah.

232
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:10,406
>> Nice to meet you.

233
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:11,324
>> Becky.

234
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,200
>> Becky, Cao Boi.

235
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:12,700
>> Jenny.

236
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:12,950
>> Jenny.

237
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,161
Okay, we've got time to get to

238
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:15,536
know each other.

239
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:15,953
Jenny?

240
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,496
>> Our tribe, Puka, is comprised

241
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,790
of five Asians.

242
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,667
I'm Filipino, Yul is Korean,

243
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:22,668
Becky is Korean.

244
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,713
Um, Brad is a mix Filipino,

245
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:29,008
Hawaiian, and Cao Boi is

246
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,635
Vietnamese.

247
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:31,552
We're a mixed group ourselves,

248
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,722
you know, within the Asian

249
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,015
community.

250
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,350
>> My grandmother's knife is

251
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:37,767
sharper than this.

252
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,019
You know, I was...

253
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,812
In Vietnam, there's this monk.

254
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,856
He lived for many years on

255
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,400
coconut only.

256
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,235
>> I have a feeling you are

257
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:47,985
gonna be telling a lot of

258
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,320
stories tonight.

259
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,529
>> Um, I gotta say, just for me,

260
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,614
I'm just.. the person I'm having

261
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,824
the most difficulty with is Cao

262
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,118
Boi because I sense a-a little

263
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,161
bit of a schism there.

264
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,538
I think there's some degree of a

265
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,916
generational gap.

266
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,627
>> My biggest concern being an

267
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,546
all-Asian tribe is I've never

268
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,339
been accepted by the Asian

269
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,007
community.

270
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:10,591
Take one look at me.

271
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:14,262
I don't look educated.

272
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,972
I don't fit the stereotype:

273
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,640
hard working, Mr. Engineer with

274
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,308
jacket, suit and tie, drive nice

275
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,309
cars.

276
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,229
I just don't fit the stereotype.

277
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,021
I belong in a hippie

278
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,940
community instead.

279
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,316
It's a very dangerous position

280
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,611
for me to be in.

281
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:33,948
>> The accommodations are

282
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,408
lovely.

283
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,492
>> Here we are.

284
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:36,784
>> Yeah-hoo!

285
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:37,785
>> I guess this is where we're

286
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,328
going to make our shelter.

287
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,079
>> Come on, let's put our hands

288
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:40,329
together.

289
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:40,871
>> We made it, and we will

290
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,581
continue to make it.

291
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,375
>> Day one, to the end.

292
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:44,834
>> To the final end.

293
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,335
>> Absolutely.

294
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,128
>> 'Cause y'all know what this

295
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:47,878
is about, right?

296
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,046
>> Yeah, we do, sir!

297
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,548
>> Represent, represent,

298
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,091
represent, represent.

299
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,175
>> Whoo, got a new chant!

300
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:53,926
>> That's what I'm talking

301
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:54,135
about!

302
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,762
>> I believe we all feel the

303
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,806
pressure to represent, and that

304
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,350
just means it's-it's just being

305
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,935
able to represent us, our

306
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:03,936
people, the African American

307
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,770
culture.

308
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,147
>> Let's get firewood.

309
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,273
One person get firewood, one

310
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,524
person get bamboo, and the

311
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:10,943
other person gets, uh, palms.

312
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:11,527
>> Okay.

313
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,278
>> Here, I don't need this.

314
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,029
I'll-I'll get the palms.

315
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:13,779
It makes me feel like, because

316
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,657
we are divided by race, now we

317
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,742
have to step up to the plate

318
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,827
and show that, yes, black people

319
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,704
do swim.

320
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,997
Yes, black people do know how

321
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,082
to get on a boat and paddle.

322
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:25,875
I mean... (laughs)

323
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,419
we don't just run track.

324
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,047
>> We almost got us a house.

325
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,009
>> Yes, honey.

326
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,594
>> Exactly.

327
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,219
>> That's some nasty hair right

328
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,388
there.

329
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,765
>> With our group, it has

330
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,641
nothing to do with race.

331
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,225
We are just a bunch of city

332
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,477
kids.

333
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,811
This couldn't cut cotton.

334
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,272
We're gonna have to sharpen it.

335
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,107
It's not that we are black.

336
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,109
We're just city slickers thrown

337
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,570
into the bareness of life.

338
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:55,696
Lay... I would lay one here, lay

339
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,198
one here, lay one here, and just

340
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:57,823
put palms over it and call it a

341
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:58,699
night.

342
00:10:58,783 --> 00:10:59,867
That's what I would do, but,

343
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,787
it's up to y'all.

344
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:04,830
>> We just got here.

345
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,040
We're trying to assemble

346
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,083
shelter.

347
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,459
It's going all right.

348
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,169
But, you know, black people

349
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,004
don't like to be told what to

350
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:12,922
do, and we have a bunch of

351
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,216
headstrong people around here,

352
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:15,758
me being one of them, I will

353
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,884
say.

354
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:17,885
>> Uh-uh.

355
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:18,928
>> 'Cause what happens is we

356
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:19,178
have...

357
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:19,887
>> I will not...

358
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,181
No, this is not going to work.

359
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:22,807
>> We got that part, so we want

360
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,974
to...

361
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:24,892
What, you want to go like this?

362
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,852
>> Yeah.

363
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:27,853
>> I think...

364
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:28,938
>> My vision, well...

365
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,064
I had a dream!

366
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,273
(laughter)

367
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,233
>> Wake up!

368
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:32,858
>> "Sekou" means leader

369
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,735
and warrior-- I do bring some

370
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,862
leadership, and I've been able

371
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,072
to pull this group's attention

372
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,407
into the focus of what needs

373
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,699
to be done, and they've been

374
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,867
able to respond.

375
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,954
Let's get some palms up, girls.

376
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,498
I wanted us to stay focused for

377
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,208
what we had to do, and I think

378
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,251
I accomplished that.

379
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,627
I'm liking this already.

380
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,295
It may have set a tone, too, and

381
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,172
if it did, I hope it, you know,

382
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:55,965
was positive for them as much as

383
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,883
it was for me.

384
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,677
>> Pretty impressive.

385
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,803
>> This is low-income housing.

386
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,889
(laughter)

387
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,321
>> How you doing back there?

388
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,406
>> I'm doing great.

389
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,575
>> Okay.

390
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,160
>> The tribes were obviously

391
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:24,994
divided by ethnicity, but it

392
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,455
doesn't matter to me if it's

393
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,039
just all other white people

394
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,708
or-or, uh, any other type of...

395
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,168
of race.

396
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:32,877
The issue is what kind of people

397
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,171
you have in your tribe, and what

398
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,464
kind of personalities, and how

399
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:36,964
you get along with them.

400
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:37,840
>> Whoo-hoo!

401
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,925
>> Here we are.

402
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,010
>> Do we anchor this thing?

403
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,679
It is going to be a true social

404
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:44,597
experiment.

405
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,222
It's going to be fascinating to

406
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,516
see how it plays out, but I

407
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,142
don't believe that just because

408
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,561
these groups have the cultural

409
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,979
similarities that that will

410
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,606
make them more specifically

411
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:54,732
cohesive.

412
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:55,608
This is<i> Survivor.</i>

413
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,109
Somebody is going to win a

414
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,027
million dollars, and they're

415
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,695
going to have to cut the throat

416
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:00,321
of the guy next to them at some

417
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,406
point.

418
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,365
>> Great haul!

419
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,283
>> Whoo.

420
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,201
>> All right.

421
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:05,868
>> As soon as we got to the

422
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,579
island, we were just pulling it

423
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,997
all in, excited about all the

424
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,998
treasure that we got.

425
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,041
We seemed to have scored with,

426
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,711
uh, two machetes and two, um,

427
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,588
slings and two chickens.

428
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:18,005
(clucking)

429
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,132
>> Oh.

430
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,050
(giggling)

431
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,092
>> Hey, make sure those chickens

432
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,135
aren't going to get out.

433
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,094
>> Yeah, but...

434
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,304
>> I did grab a chicken.

435
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,639
The chicken was belonging to

436
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,681
the green team.

437
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:28,682
I didn't even know.

438
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:29,058
I saw a chicken.

439
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,227
I grabbed the chicken, 'cause

440
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,311
the chicken was free.

441
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,854
>> Y'all kicked ass today.

442
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,439
>> Yeah, can we just say that

443
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,232
for one second?

444
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,733
>> I think we should have a

445
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:38,234
coconut and toast to our

446
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,068
victory.

447
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,028
>> Let's do that.

448
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:41,904
To us all.

449
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:42,112
>> Hey!

450
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,656
>> Cheers!

451
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:44,573
>> How cool is this?

452
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,658
>> To the whiteys!

453
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,742
>> The whiteys!

454
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,077
>> I was going to say Rarotonga,

455
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,496
but, I mean...

456
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,872
>> We are the Caucasian group.

457
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,875
We've got, like, a jock, and

458
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,627
then we've got the sorority

459
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,004
type, you've got the steady

460
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,047
type, you know, you got the

461
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,925
family man, and then you got me,

462
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,260
who's kind of like the

463
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,429
alternative option.

464
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,430
>> Tell me your name.

465
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,765
>> Jessica, but my friends call

466
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:10,766
me Flicka.

467
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:11,767
>> Flicka.

468
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,768
My friend Flicka.

469
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:13,769
That's easy.

470
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:14,186
>> My friend Flicka.

471
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,814
I've never seen that flick.

472
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:17,731
(screaming)

473
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:18,148
>> (gasps): No! Oh.

474
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,985
(clucking)

475
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,278
(screaming)

476
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,738
>> No! Flicka!

477
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,533
Why did you have to do it?!

478
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,951
>> I am so sorry.

479
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,619
>> I got a chicken in here.

480
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,537
Guys, come around here.

481
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,538
>> Where, where, where?

482
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,289
>> Okay, okay.

483
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,456
Surround this chicken.

484
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,291
>> All right...

485
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,417
>> There's a chicken right here.

486
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,001
Okay, wait, wait, don't scare,

487
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,043
don't scare, don't scare.

488
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,128
>> Did you get him?

489
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,338
>> No, he moved too fast.

490
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,840
>> Oh.

491
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,301
>> I went to pick up the...

492
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,135
and-and they ran out.

493
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,012
I can't even believe it.

494
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,222
>> Oh!

495
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,099
>> One-second mistake cost us

496
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,100
the chickens.

497
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,268
The woods ate the chickens.

498
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,269
They're in there.

499
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,353
And now I hear them.

500
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,605
I scream at them.

501
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:57,938
(crowing)

502
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,566
So I'm not happy right now with

503
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,650
Flicka.

504
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,735
I can forgive her, right?

505
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:03,944
But I-I don't have to forgive

506
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,404
her, 'cause she screwed up my

507
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,948
chickens.

508
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,628
>> Ah!

509
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:21,545
>> You found it?

510
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,504
(whooping)

511
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,047
>> Yeah?

512
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:28,260
(both laughing and whooping)

513
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,975
>> That's something very nice.

514
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:35,267
>> Oh, yeah.

515
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,478
>> Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

516
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,729
>> Oh, good going, mama.

517
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,105
Oh, my God.

518
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,191
>> Parasitic paradise.

519
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,734
>> Our water barrel is full of

520
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,444
parasites and extremely dirty,

521
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:48,197
but a lot of water is in there,

522
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,407
so when we have some fire to

523
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,158
boil the water that we have,

524
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,327
no one has to worry about

525
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,244
getting dehydrated.

526
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,663
>> ♪ We got our water! ♪

527
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:56,789
(humming)

528
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:57,873
>> Rebecca is cool.

529
00:15:57,956 --> 00:15:58,999
Rebecca is really cool.

530
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,334
We're both from New York, so

531
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,669
that already has a little

532
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,254
immediate sense of familiarity.

533
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,590
She's just smart, athletic.

534
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,092
You know, I feel like we can

535
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,677
work really well together.

536
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,595
>> All right, you got it,

537
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,596
Rebecca.

538
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,764
>> There we go, babe.

539
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:14,306
>> I feel that Rebecca and

540
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,266
Sundra are much closer than I

541
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,270
could be to either of them.

542
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,563
>> I got water! I got water.

543
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,856
>> I'm so proud of you.

544
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,440
>> They go off together a lot.

545
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,442
They're always talking, just

546
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,236
the two of them, so that's just

547
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,070
something that I'm watching.

548
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,364
I'm keeping my eyes on it,

549
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,782
keeping the pulse on it.

550
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:32,366
>> Did y'all bring back some

551
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,158
water?

552
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,243
>> No, 'cause we don't have

553
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,911
any...

554
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:36,495
>> We have no fire to boil.

555
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:37,121
>> Okay...

556
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,205
>> We will work on fire.

557
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,416
We're not going to give up.

558
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,166
>> Okay.

559
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,001
>> Okay? And I'm going to focus

560
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,087
my energy right into the wood.

561
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,088
>> Oxygen...

562
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,089
>> Yeah.

563
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,758
(sighs)

564
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,759
>> Okay, everybody focus, okay?

565
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,635
>> Who's holding the stick?

566
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:52,720
>> We're making fire.

567
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,012
>> I got the stick.

568
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,223
>> Focus on what we're doing.

569
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,141
>> Are we smoking?

570
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,058
>> No.

571
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:58,350
>> Come on!

572
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,143
>> Oh, yes!

573
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,060
>> Ooh.

574
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,937
>> I need a break.

575
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,896
>> All right.

576
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,939
>> You want to do it?

577
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:04,773
>> Yes.

578
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,524
>> It's all you.

579
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,442
>> Building houses, making

580
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,985
fire, in the name of the Lord...

581
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,987
>> Stay cool.

582
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,071
>> He likes to take long breaks,

583
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,073
and we're... It's...

584
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,825
We've got too much to do.

585
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,702
I understand we're all low on

586
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,454
fuel right now, but he is not

587
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,707
one to stay focused at all.

588
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,460
You want something, right?

589
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,169
Sometimes you just have to do it

590
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:30,007
yourself.

591
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,383
(sighs)

592
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,260
>> It's just very frustrating,

593
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,803
but I'm not going to say

594
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,429
anything more to him right now,

595
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,264
'cause I'm in a state of

596
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,182
pisstation.

597
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,183
(laughs)

598
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,018
>> Can I get a lunch break?

599
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,312
(laughter)

600
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,529
>> It's getting cold out here.

601
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,363
>> Pity the kid...

602
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,406
>> Is anybody else getting cold?

603
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:54,823
>> I'm freaky cold.

604
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:55,365
>> Y'all want to go back?

605
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,116
>> Yeah.

606
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,243
>> Should we go snuggle at home?

607
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,077
>> Should we try it?

608
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,329
>> Can we just sleep closer?

609
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,414
I'm so cold.

610
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,124
I get really cold at night, and

611
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,876
so I've been sleeping next to

612
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:06,835
Adam.

613
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:07,920
I mean, he's the biggest guy out

614
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,588
here, and he's a good wind

615
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,006
blocker.

616
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:11,548
Okay, all right, all right,

617
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,801
we're all spooning the same way.

618
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:18,013
This is going to work.

619
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:19,264
(laughter)

620
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,100
>> We need to all slide in.

621
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:22,351
It's cold.

622
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,603
>> Yeah. Slide this way.

623
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,270
>> Adam's an attractive guy.

624
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,314
I mean, he's got a good-looking

625
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,357
face.

626
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,149
You know, he's fit.

627
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,317
I mean, of course, Adam's a

628
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:30,692
good-looking guy.

629
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,153
>> I'm on fire.

630
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,447
>> I'm... I'm dry.

631
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,032
>> I know you're dry right now.

632
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:38,367
>> It does make the island a

633
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,576
little more bearable to have a

634
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,203
couple of good-looking girls.

635
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,371
Great-looking girls.

636
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,248
I'm attracted to Candice a lot.

637
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,499
>> It doesn't matter.

638
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:46,416
It's still warm.

639
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:46,708
>> Really?

640
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,209
>> Yeah.

641
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,961
The body heat is the best thing

642
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,170
by far.

643
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:50,712
>> Adam wants to be the big,

644
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,631
strong man, and take care of

645
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:53,674
Candice.

646
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,134
She's, like, a sweet little

647
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,802
girl, and they're snuggling, you

648
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:57,177
know?

649
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,179
I don't know.

650
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:03,517
Romance is in the air.

651
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,317
>> Where's the headache?

652
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,485
>> Like, right here.

653
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,236
It's from being seasick all day.

654
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,362
>> Okay, sit down.

655
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:18,323
Sit down. Sit on...

656
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,576
Brad's problem was he didn't

657
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,910
have the normal headache.

658
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:22,703
In Vietnamese, we call it a "bad

659
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,454
wind" that's causing him this,

660
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,498
and that results in a headache.

661
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,541
Okay, what I'm going to do is

662
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:28,792
I'm going to pull this wind out

663
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,879
of you-- this bad wind.

664
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,215
It's not a regular migraine,

665
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,467
on one side or in the back.

666
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,761
It's usually a sinus headache

667
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,345
near the front, and that's an

668
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,806
indicator of the bad wind.

669
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,016
You got it.

670
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,475
You got a touch of bad wind.

671
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,060
It's not real bad, but it is not

672
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,521
great.

673
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,522
There.

674
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,231
You'll feel better now.

675
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,190
Your headache be gone in a few

676
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:52,608
minutes.

677
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,650
That will go away.

678
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,068
It will fade away.

679
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,570
That's called the indicator.

680
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,821
I just pulled it out of you.

681
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:58,447
That's how bad you have it in

682
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:58,614
you.

683
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,281
>> It's not that bad.

684
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,908
>> No.

685
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,201
The I put an indicator here.

686
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,577
By pulling it out, I can see how

687
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,953
bad he has it.

688
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,121
I told him, when it's completely

689
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:07,664
gone, your body will be fully

690
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,333
healed.

691
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,375
>> What the hell happened to

692
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,376
you?

693
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,712
>> He put his hands all over...

694
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:14,421
>> What?

695
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,924
And he did that to your face?

696
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,008
>> Yeah.

697
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,302
>> It looks like it's burned!

698
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:20,802
>> The others-- the Asian

699
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:21,428
Americans-- they were born in

700
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,180
America.

701
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,306
They've lost touch.

702
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,432
They were not born in the old

703
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:26,767
country, where a lot of this

704
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,268
stuff is people don't have

705
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,520
antibiotics, so they have to

706
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,064
figure out other ways to do to

707
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,732
get by.

708
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:34,316
>> You all right?

709
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:34,524
>> Yeah.

710
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,485
I had a headache, and he got

711
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,236
rid of it, actually.

712
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,488
>> He hit you on the forehead?

713
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,364
>> He was, like, squeezing my

714
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,365
forehead.

715
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,282
I will be truthfully honest

716
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,700
with you.

717
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,243
I did have a headache.

718
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,578
I don't have a headache anymore.

719
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,704
But I do have a red dot on my

720
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,122
forehead.

721
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,249
>> You don't have a headache.

722
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:50,916
>> I don't have a headache

723
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:51,541
anymore.

724
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,459
>> You have this red line...

725
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,377
>> That's all right.

726
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,294
>> Cao Boi is an interesting

727
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:54,461
guy.

728
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,213
When I first met him, I just

729
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:56,755
kind of wrote him off as a

730
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,341
crazy kook, but in between the

731
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,009
random kind of inane nonsense,

732
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,386
there's actually, like, gems and

733
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,512
nuggets of information that are

734
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:03,887
actually useful.

735
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:04,513
>> So, when is it going to go

736
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,514
away?

737
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,515
>> When you're completely

738
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,393
healed.

739
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:20,779
>> Tree mail.

740
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:21,863
>> Tree mail.

741
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:22,656
>> Sweet.

742
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:23,949
>> Dude, look at all this stuff,

743
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:24,116
man.

744
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,659
>> Look it, we even got our own

745
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,994
little flag and everything.

746
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:27,327
>> Yeah.

747
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,788
>> "Life is tough on the island,

748
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,873
and if it's fire that you lack

749
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,875
you can paddle for your food."

750
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,626
Yeah.

751
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,086
>> We're going to a challenge

752
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:36,712
today that's both immunity and,

753
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,088
uh, reward.

754
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,631
I would like to see us win, but

755
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,424
if we lose, it's not the end of

756
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,759
the world at the beginning of

757
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,845
the game.

758
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,850
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

759
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,031
Tell me about the marooning.

760
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:04,573
I want to find out about the

761
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,158
chickens.

762
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,701
Yul, I saw you dive in for one

763
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:07,909
chicken.

764
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,870
Did you make it back to camp

765
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:10,078
with it?

766
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:10,912
>> No.

767
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:11,747
(laughter)

768
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,290
I got the chicken out of the

769
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:13,874
water.

770
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:14,499
I handed it off to a tribesmate,

771
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,543
and next thing I see is someone

772
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,795
else from another team running

773
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:19,838
around with my chicken.

774
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:20,547
(laughter)

775
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,256
>> PROBST: What?

776
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:22,174
Who took the chicken?

777
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:22,674
>> Where is that fellow?

778
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,677
I think you know.

779
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:26,720
>> PROBST: Jonathan?

780
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:27,721
>> Did I?

781
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:28,805
(laughter)

782
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,348
I had a chicken, but I don't

783
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,183
know, you know.

784
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:31,767
I mean, honestly, it was so

785
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,144
hectic, that I just grabbed the

786
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,062
chicken.

787
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:35,979
(laughter)

788
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,230
Sorry, dude.

789
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,273
>> PROBST: Okay, you ready to

790
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:39,357
get to your first challenge?

791
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,484
>> Yeah!

792
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,526
>> PROBST: Here's how it works.

793
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,070
On my "go," you're going to race

794
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,780
to assemble a puzzle boat.

795
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,573
Once the boat is assembled, use

796
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:47,407
seven braces to hold the boat

797
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,576
together.

798
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:50,660
You'll then paddle out and

799
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,329
retrieve fire in the form of a

800
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,497
torch.

801
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,082
When you get back to shore, you

802
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:55,665
will take those seven braces,

803
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,001
race back to the starting mat,

804
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:58,627
where you will find four more

805
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,962
puzzles in the form of north,

806
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,465
south, east, and west.

807
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,508
Once you've completed those,

808
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,219
take the braces, use them as

809
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,179
rungs to build a ladder.

810
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:09,763
Place the compass points in

811
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,807
their appropriate spot, get to

812
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,766
the top.

813
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,060
First three tribes to get all

814
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,728
their tribe members to the top

815
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:17,437
and light their fire barrel

816
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,731
wins.

817
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,024
Want to know what you're playing

818
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:21,733
for?

819
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:22,150
>> Yes.

820
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:22,943
>> Yeah.

821
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,236
>> PROBST: First three tribes,

822
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,196
fire in the form of flint.

823
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,781
(applause)

824
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,324
As a bonus, the tribe who

825
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:29,741
finishes first gets

826
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,160
a fire-making kit.

827
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:32,828
>> Yay!

828
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,830
>> PROBST: A lot of kindling,

829
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:35,455
water-proof matches, kerosene.

830
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,749
If you can't get a fire going

831
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,500
with that, you need to go home.

832
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,168
(laughs)

833
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:40,669
Most importantly, you're

834
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,255
playing for what in this game?

835
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:43,839
>> Immunity.

836
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,549
>> PROBST: Immunity.

837
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,008
The immunity idol is in three

838
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,385
pieces, because the first three

839
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:49,469
tribes to finish win immunity.

840
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,512
Losing tribe, you get nothing

841
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,806
but a date with me and the

842
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,391
first person will be voted out.

843
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,184
There is one other twist to

844
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:56,560
this challenge.

845
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,854
The details are here in this

846
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,188
note.

847
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:00,814
We'll save it until after the

848
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:01,606
challenge, and then I'll reveal

849
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:06,903
it.

850
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:10,615
Okay, for reward and immunity,

851
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,285
survivors ready?

852
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:17,372
Go!

853
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,296
These boats are puzzles.

854
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,966
They only go together one way.

855
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,890
Puka off to a good start.

856
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,183
>> Bring it over here, you guys.

857
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:36,725
Bring it over here and do it

858
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,018
over here.

859
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:38,810
>> PROBST: Aitu getting their

860
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,605
boat together.

861
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,064
>> No, there's another piece.

862
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:43,773
Another piece.

863
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:44,983
>> PROBST: Hiki's having a

864
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,110
terrible time.

865
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,321
Raro getting closer.

866
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,281
>> Right there.

867
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:51,823
>> PROBST: Aitu putting on

868
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:55,744
their braces, very close.

869
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:59,915
Puka getting very close.

870
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,877
Aitu has their boat together.

871
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,504
Hiki still having trouble.

872
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:07,881
Aitu is first in the water,

873
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,090
heading out to their torch.

874
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,551
Puka has their boat together.

875
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:14,471
Aitu with a big lead.

876
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,639
Rarotonga's heading out to their

877
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,265
torch.

878
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,350
>> Okay.

879
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,184
>> Throw that up here.

880
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,101
>> Which one?

881
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,269
Which one?

882
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,814
>> PROBST: Hiki, work together.

883
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,234
Aitu first to their torch.

884
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:30,695
Christina in the front.

885
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,823
Puka right behind.

886
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:38,703
Aitu heading back.

887
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,080
Puka now has their fire.

888
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:42,666
They're coming back.

889
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:47,587
Raro cannot get it together

890
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,215
with their paddling.

891
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,216
>> The boat's coming apart.

892
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,342
>> PROBST: Hiki not even

893
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:53,009
heading out yet.

894
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,135
Let's go!

895
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:54,719
>> Four. I need four.

896
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,012
>> Four. Four!

897
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,682
>> PROBST: Aitu first back.

898
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:03,937
Puka gaining some ground.

899
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,106
Raro has their torch.

900
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:08,149
They're coming back.

901
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,776
Puka's back to shore.

902
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:13,780
Hiki has it together finally.

903
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:14,614
Heading out to their torch.

904
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:18,118
Aitu has their seven braces.

905
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:21,454
They're heading up.

906
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,872
Raro struggling with their

907
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:23,581
paddling.

908
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:24,791
Still in the water, losing a

909
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,918
lot of time.

910
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,795
>> Go, go, go!

911
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,964
>> PROBST: Billy really slowing

912
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,549
Aitu down.

913

Puka catching up.

914
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:38,763
>> Okay, go, go!

915
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,016
>> You going?

916
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,183
>> PROBST: Aitu working on their

917
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,101
puzzle.

918

Puka working on their puzzle.

919
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,395
You're looking for four

920
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:49,607
symbols: N-S-E-W.

921
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,692
Hiki has their torch.

922
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,694
They're coming back.

923
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,863
They're still in this challenge.

924
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,197
Raro coming back.

925
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,824
They're heading to the puzzle.

926
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:58,700
We're neck and neck, Puka and

927
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,744
Aitu.

928
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,412
>> Go north.

929
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:03,663
>> We got it, baby.

930
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:04,789
>> PROBST: Jonathan and Adam

931
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:08,126

Hiki's getting back in this

933
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:13,173
challenge.

934
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,717
Puka, you're good!

935
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,761
Puka solved all four puzzles.

936
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:18,720
They're heading up.

937
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,180
Hiki, you're in this thing.

938
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:24,100
Let's go!

939
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,685
Aitu has it!

940
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:26,811
They've got all four puzzles!

941
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,647
Aitu gaining on Puka.

942
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,900
>> Let's get first now!

943
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,402
Come on!

944
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,446

Jenny's up! Yul's up!

949
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,875
Puka wins the challenge!

950
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,628
Immunity and fire.

951
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:52,629
We're looking for two more

952
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:53,797
spots.

953
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,173
Do not quit!

954
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,050
Aitu coming up.

955
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:00,220
They've got it together.

956
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,721
Aitu wins flint and immunity.

957
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,306
>> Oh, yeah!

958
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,557
>> PROBST: One spot left.

959
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:08,478
>> I got it.

960
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:10,271
>> PROBST: Hiki, you are back

961
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,898
in this challenge.

962
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,400
Raro having a terrible time

963
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,484
with their puzzle.

964
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:14,943
Lost a lot of time.

965
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,444
>> Don't panic.

966
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,613
>> Don't panic, baby!

967
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:19,656
>> PROBST: You're good!

968
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:20,824
Raro has it!

969
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,201
They've got all four puzzles.

970
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:23,868
They've got to put their braces

971
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,995
in and get to the top.

972
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:30,166
>> There! No!

973
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,086
>> PROBST: Raro up.

974
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,755
They forgot their puzzle pieces!

975
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,549
Hiki, let's go!

976
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,843
>> Hand them up!

977
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,601
>> PROBST: Candice with the last

978
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:48,852
piece.

979
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:49,936
Adam places it in.

980
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:54,607
Got to get it in!

981
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:55,817
Raro up.

982
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,944
Harmony's up.

983
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,947
Raro wins!

984
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:05,160
Puka, Aitu, Raro win immunity.

985
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,036
Hiki, Tribal Council.

986
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:10,915
>> Damn!

987
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,251
>> PROBST: Okay.

988
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:18,006
Flint-- Raro, Puka, Aitu.

989
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,341
In addition, Puka, because you

990
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:20,925
won the challenge, fire-making

991
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,010
kit.

992
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,678
The more important part of

993
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:24,637
this, immunity.

994
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,931
Raro, safe from Tribal Council.

995
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,725
Aitu, you guys are safe from

996
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:29,642
Tribal Council.

997
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:30,226
Puka, because you won, you get

998
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:35,273
the head of the idol.

999
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:38,151
Hiki tribe, no fire for you.

1000
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,652
No immunity.

1001
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:40,612
A date with me at Tribal

1002
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:41,571
Council.

1003
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,573
Somebody going home.

1004
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:44,199
There is one last twist to this

1005
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,992
challenge.

1006
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:46,451
I showed you the note

1007
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:46,868
beforehand.

1008
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,454
I'll now read it.

1009
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:50,622
"The losing tribe will choose

1010
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,458
one person from any of the

1011
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,834
"other three tribes to go to

1012
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,420
Exile Island."

1013
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:58,588
>> That's what I'm talking

1014
00:29:58,671 --> 00:29:59,714
about.

1015
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:00,381
>> PROBST: Here's what that

1016
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,216
means.

1017
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,133
You're going to choose one

1018
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,009
person from one of these other

1019
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,385
three tribes.

1020
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,678
That person will leave here

1021
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:06,262
right now and spend two nights

1022
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,097
on Exile Island.

1023
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:08,973
It is a big disadvantage to be

1024
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,017
separated from your tribe this

1025
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,352
early in the game.

1026
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:15,271
Exile Island is no picnic.

1027
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,856
There is one bag of water out

1028
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,941
there.

1029
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,817
You will also have a machete, a

1030
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,444
flint and a pot.

1031
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,196
The silver lining to Exile

1032
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,114
Island is, hidden somewhere on

1033
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,617
the island is an immunity idol.

1034
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,952
That will protect you at Tribal

1035
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,537
Council.

1036
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,120
It's good up through the final

1037
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,914
four.

1038
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,082
When somebody finds it, you can

1039
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,209
keep that information to

1040
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,168
yourself.

1041
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:37,961
You can share it with whoever

1042
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:38,878
you want.

1043
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:39,629
You can even assign that

1044
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:40,838
immunity and give it to

1045
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,048
somebody else.

1046
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,132
Each time somebody is sent to

1047
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,342
Exile Island, you will get a

1048
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,219
clue as to the whereabouts of

1049
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,679
the idol.

1050
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:48,471
Hiki, who is it going to be?

1051
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,640
>> Let's talk this over.

1052
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,100
We gotta look at these guys.

1053
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,769
We got to take...

1054
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:56,521
We want to...

1055
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,610
>> Let's do it.

1056
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,403
>> PROBST: All right.

1057
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,237
Back on your mat.

1058
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:04,946
Before you tell me who it is,

1059
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:05,572
it was interesting to note that

1060
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,031
the two guys came out here and

1061
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,616
made the decision, and the

1062
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:08,992
women stayed back.

1063
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,910
>> They seemed like they had

1064
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,538
taken control over it.

1065
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,790
>> PROBST: Okay.

1066
00:31:15,873 --> 00:31:17,959
Who's going to Exile Island?

1067
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:18,918
>> We don't know his name, but

1068
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,170
we can point him out to you.

1069
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,130
>> We say karma is a bizzle, so

1070
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,131
my chicken man over here.

1071
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,758
>> PROBST: Jonathan, you're

1072
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:26,718
going to Exile Island.

1073
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:29,137
Grab your stuff.

1074
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,931
>> See you guys in two days.

1075
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,558
>> PROBST: Take this with you.

1076
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,768
Here's your first clue as to

1077
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:39,105
the whereabouts of the idol.

1078
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:48,114
Okay, Hiki, sadly, one of the

1079
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,074
five of you will be the first

1080
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,993
person voted out of this game.

1081
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:52,952
I'll see you guys at Tribal

1082
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:53,703
Council.

1083
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:54,621
Everybody can head back to

1084
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,789
their camps.

1085
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,350
>> I think it was because I took

1086
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,393
the Asian guy's chicken that

1087
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,561
the African-American guys chose

1088
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:18,895
me.

1089
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:19,729
That's all they said.

1090
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,105
I was so shocked by what

1091
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,148
happened, I didn't even have a

1092
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,942
comeback.

1093
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,112
"To make a top grade, stand in

1094
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:28,363
a line.

1095
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,031
"If the southern isle vanishes,

1096
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:34,327
a salvation you'll find."

1097
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,162
The clue that they gave me to

1098
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,498
find the idol, I took that to

1099
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:39,957
mean to make the top grade was

1100
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:44,379
an A or an A-plus.

1101
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,046
So I started digging.

1102
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,714
The idol!

1103
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,549
Made sense to me, but I just

1104
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,635
haven't found it yet.

1105
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,430
I'm cold, miserable, shivering,

1106
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,807
missing my wife and kids.

1107
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,057
(moans)

1108
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,142
Exile Island's really terrible.

1109
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,237
>> You guys work on the fire.

1110
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,280
We'll continue working on the

1111
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:11,781
bedding.

1112
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:12,240
>> Yeah.

1113
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,908
Tonight is the first Tribal

1114
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:15,243
Council, and our tribe, the

1115
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:19,163
Manihiki tribe has to vote

1116
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,416
someone out of the tribe.

1117
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,250
>> There's no one to blame.

1118
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,252
There's...

1119
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,337
I guess we just...

1120
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,886
>> Yeah. The game begins.

1121
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,430
>> Yep.

1122
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,681
>> If they're in threes,

1123
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:37,724
they're going to be vote, trying

1124
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,600
to vote one of, one of<i> us</i> off.

1125
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,184
>> They're stupid if they do

1126
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,394
that.

1127
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:41,769
>> They're stupid!

1128
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:42,437
>> So we gotta pull one of the

1129
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,771
women.

1130
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:44,355
I don't know, you know, you

1131
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,565
never know, though.

1132
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:46,107
These sisters could think,

1133
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,859
"Yeah, we don't need no men, we

1134
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,944
can do it all ourselves."

1135
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,035
>> It's gonna be an interesting

1136
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,287
dynamic now.

1137
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,121
>> I already feel the tension.

1138
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,206
>> Yes.

1139
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,166
>> The ladies and I are

1140
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,251
thinking that Sekou might be

1141
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,794
the right person to vote out at

1142
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,755
this time because we've had a

1143
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:09,338
hard time kind of establishing

1144
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,215
leadership, and no one's been

1145
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,468
working in unison, and we think

1146
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,093
that he plays a major role in

1147
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,637
that, and it might be easier for

1148
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,472
us to work as a team without

1149
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,474
him.

1150
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,892
>> They may think that they can

1151
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,227
get away with losing me or you,

1152
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,562
or me.

1153
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:25,480
It ain't going to work.

1154
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,272
>> I know.

1155
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:27,607
>> They can't even make fire.

1156
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,399
They can't even build a hut,

1157
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:29,150
dude.

1158
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,068
I'm telling you.

1159
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:31,611
>> Sundra...

1160
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:32,195
>> And Becca.

1161
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,154
and Becca are tight.

1162
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,155
>> Right. Right.

1163
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:34,822
>> They're not gonna turn on one

1164
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:35,573
another.

1165
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:35,990
I got that sense.

1166
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,033
>> I got that.

1167
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,117
>> So...

1168
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:42,622
>> Right.

1169
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:43,414
We know that it's gonna

1170
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,290
eventually come down to a

1171
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,292
woman-men thing. So...

1172
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:49,003
My plan and Nate's plan was to

1173
00:34:49,086 --> 00:34:51,964
make an ally of Stephannie.

1174
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:56,719
If you all lose me tonight, and

1175
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,012
y'all lose another competition,

1176
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,514
and ultimately y'all will lose

1177
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,265
Nathan, and there's just three

1178
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,058
girls...

1179
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:02,475
>> Mm-hmm.

1180
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:03,976
>> ...you're out.

1181
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:04,477
>> Why do you say that?

1182
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,355
>> Because them two are tight.

1183
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,607
Because them two are like peas

1184
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,817
in a pod.

1185
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,401
You have to break that up.

1186
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,236
>> Mm-hmm.

1187
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,321
>> Sekou actually came to me

1188
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:18,115
trying to persuade me to align

1189
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,200
myself with him and Nate and to

1190
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,744
vote Sundra out.

1191
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,539
>> We gotta have you, okay?

1192
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,248
Now, do you want to make it in a

1193
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,833
world with a bunch of people

1194
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:27,375
who got an alliance based on

1195
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,669
where they're from, or somebody

1196
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,045
that knows how to survive in

1197
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:32,588
this environment?

1198
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,381
Or that can bring on some fire?

1199
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,382
>> We don't have any fire yet,

1200
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,258
though.

1201
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,093
>> That's all right.

1202
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,679
When I build a fire... (sighs)

1203
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:40,221
y'all better keep it going,

1204
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,431
because if y'all boot me out,

1205
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:43,599
there ain't gonna be no more

1206
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,642
fire.

1207
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:45,768
This ain't a glamour walk.

1208
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,770
This is about survival.

1209
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,313
This is the real thing about

1210
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,481
getting down.

1211
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,315
Do you feel what I'm saying?

1212
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,024
>> I do.

1213
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:52,900
>> Okay?

1214
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,694
>> I know that my vote is, is a

1215
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:55,278
swing vote.

1216
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,446
You know, you've got Nate and

1217
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,407
Sekou, you have the men on one

1218
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,993
side, you've got Sundra and

1219
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:02,785
you've got Rebecca, the women,

1220
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,787
on the other side.

1221
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:05,288
They're very close.

1222
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,873
The guys are very close.

1223
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,958
So of course I'm the swing vote.

1224
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:19,886
>> Okay?

1225
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:20,219
>> Mm-hmm.

1226
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:20,761
>> All right.

1227
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,013
>> All right.

1228
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,264
>> We need everybody.

1229
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,807
So it's gonna be sad to say

1230
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,017
good-bye to somebody tonight.

1231
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,601
It's gonna be a little

1232
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,686
difficult.

So, catch me up.

1251
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:39,048
Rebecca, did anybody step up

1252

right away as a leader?

1253
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,009
>> Yes. Sekou definitely

1254
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:42,510
stepped up as a leader and

1255
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,720
tried to help structurally

the best and the quickest way to

1259

plan to step up as a leader, or

1262
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:54,522
did you look at the tribe and

1263
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,899
say, "I think I'm probably the

1264
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:57,817
best guy for the job"?

and started putting that into

1267

effect, and I think everybody

1268
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,573
just gravitated towards that.

1269
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,158
I didn't say, "Okay, I'm running

1270
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:06,367
things."

1271
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,910

It's just something you wouldn't

"Okay, we're gonna have to

1298
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,611

1304

how people pair up becomes very

1306
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,539
important.

00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:54,540

1308
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,375
>> I noticed right off the bat,

1309
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,252
well, Rebecca and I have kind of

1310
00:38:58,335 --> 00:38:59,378
bonded.

1311
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,546
And then I realized that the

1312
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,173
two guys had bonded.

1313
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,424

00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,434
and you're not a part of either

1321
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,643
one of those groups?

1322
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:15,978
>> Naturally, women are going

1323
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,605
to stick together. Um...

1324
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,356
And the men will naturally bond

1325
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:19,648
together.

1326
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,107
That's just natural.

1327
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,984
But I'm the odd man out.

1328
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,278
That's kind of strange, and I

1329
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:25,404
kind of wondered about that,

1330
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,489
but we're all still together.

1331
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,449
>> PROBST: Rebecca, only three

1332
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,159
days.

1333
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,786
Somebody's going home tonight.

1334
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:32,495
So what do you do in terms of

1335
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,371
your vote?

1336
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:34,997
What are you looking at in this

1337
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,165
tribe?

1338
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,292
>> You look at where we're weak

1339
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:40,836
and what we did wrong over the

1340
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,881
last three days, and hope that

1341
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:46,467
in voting, that will somehow be

1342
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:46,717
corrected.

1343
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,011
>> PROBST: Well, unfortunately

1344
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,387
one of the five of you will

1345
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,514
have the distinction of being

1346
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:52,598
the first person voted out.

1347
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:53,641
It is time to vote.

1348
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,726
Sekou, you're up.

1349
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,493
>> You are our weakest, weakest

1350
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,578
link.

1351
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:30,261
>> You are a sweet, sweet man.

1352
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:31,428
We just thought this was the

1353
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,514
right move for right now.

1354
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:05,713
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1355
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,798
votes.

1356
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:18,976
Once the votes are read, the

1357
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:19,810
decision is final.

1358
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:20,811
The person voted out will be

1359
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:21,729
asked to leave the Tribal

1360
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,063
Council area immediately.

1361
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,607
I'll read the votes.

1362
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,734
First vote--

1363
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,819
Sundra.

1364
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,324
Sekou.

1365
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,825
One vote Sundra, one vote Sekou.

1366
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:38,162
Sundra.

1367
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:39,622
That's two votes Sundra, one

1368
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,707
vote Sekou.

1369
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:45,336
Sekou.

1370
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,004
We're tied, two votes Sekou,

1371
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,839
two votes Sundra, one vote left.

1372
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,428
First person voted out of

1373
00:41:54,511 --> 00:41:56,513
<i>Survivor: Cook Islands...</i>

1374
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,352
Sekou.

1375
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,520
You need to bring me your torch.

1376
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:14,949
Sekou, the tribe has spoken.

1377
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,034
It's time for you to go.

1378
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,377
If what you said tonight is

1379
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,753
true and you just voted out

1380
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:28,587
your weakest link, then you

1381
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,798
should go back to camp a

1382
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,800
stronger, more organized tribe.

1383
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:33,926
Good news is, because you've

1384
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,594
been to Tribal Council, you now

1385
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,097
have fire.

1386
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:38,472
Grab your torches.

1387
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:38,973
(laughter)

1388
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,975
Head on back to camp.

>> PROBST: Next time on<i> Survivor</i>

1398
00:42:58,617 --> 00:42:59,159
>> What do you call a

1399
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,452
Vietnamese with three dogs?

1400
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:01,620
>> PROBST: Cao Boi's jokes get

1401
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:02,413
no laughs.

1402
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:03,497
>> A joke is a joke, really.

1403
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,081
>> No, it's not.

1404
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:04,498
>> No.

1405
00:43:04,581 --> 00:43:05,082
>> No, it's not a joke.

1406
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,208
>> I don't worry about what

1407
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:06,917
other people think.

1408
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,669
>> PROBST: And Billy's slacking

1409
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:11,005
drives Aitu to drastic measures.

1410
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:11,839
>> Billy's just dead weight.

1411
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,382
>> Ozzy really wants to throw

1412
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:14,008
the challenge, but I'm thinking,

1413
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,509
you know this doesn't seem

1414
00:43:15,592 --> 00:43:21,432
right.

1415
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:22,641
>> I believe a good leader is

1416
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,685
one who can instill some

1417
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,438
guidance and I'm sure that I

1418
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:28,856
had a real strong effect with

1419
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:29,732
my tribe.

1420
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,066
I have no doubt about that.

1421
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:31,692
They saw that I was a real

1422
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:32,735
strong leader.

1423
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,361
Well, guess what?

1424
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:34,903
They're going to be a really

1425
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,739
strong tribe, and I'm proud of

1426
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:37,698
that.

1427
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,451
And my torch may be out, but my

1428
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:42,536
flame is still burning.
