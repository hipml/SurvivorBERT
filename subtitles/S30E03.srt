00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:05,180
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:05,842 --> 00:00:08,016
Carolyn found the immunity idol...

4
00:00:09,896 --> 00:00:11,744
Oh my God !

5
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:16,373
...while the White Collars adopted 
the Colorless way of life.

6
00:00:16,373 --> 00:00:18,854
Why did our camp 
become a naturist camp?

7
00:00:18,854 --> 00:00:20,495
What's going on ?

8
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:24,444
Among the Bleus de Travail, 
the hard work was beginning to weigh.

9
00:00:24,444 --> 00:00:27,398
Without wanting to piss off, 
everyone must move.

10
00:00:27,793 --> 00:00:31,454
There are things 
to do for survival.

11
00:00:31,454 --> 00:00:33,323
- At the last immunity test... 
- Come on Will!

12
00:00:33,323 --> 00:00:36,116
For Will, 
it's an absolute disaster.

13
00:00:39,355 --> 00:00:41,807
Worker's Blues 
gain immunity and reward,

14
00:00:41,807 --> 00:00:44,303
sending the Colorless 
to the council!

15
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:47,843
As we approach the first 
council of the Colorless...

16
00:00:47,843 --> 00:00:48,666
Do not touch me !

17
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,571
...Nina struggled to fit in...

18
00:00:50,571 --> 00:00:55,101
You would think that my tribe 
would try to make me feel included.

19
00:00:55,101 --> 00:00:57,234
...while Vince 
tried to recruit Will.

20
00:00:57,234 --> 00:00:58,860
Si on sort Jenn ...

21
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,635
- We keep control. 
- Exactly.

22
00:01:00,635 --> 00:01:03,596
Now is the perfect time 
to take action.

23
00:01:04,008 --> 00:01:08,008
But Will promised to follow 
the young people to eliminate Nina.

24
00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:09,861
- We're dividing... the votes. 
- We're going to split.

25
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:12,572
Girls, you vote Vince. 
We will vote for Nina.

26
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,386
Hope Will is with me,

27
00:01:14,386 --> 00:01:17,538
because otherwise, it will confuse 
a lot of plans.

28
00:01:18,048 --> 00:01:19,388
But at the council,

29
00:01:19,388 --> 00:01:21,939
Will decided to follow 
his own agenda...

30
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:24,056
Sorry, bro. 
But you have to go.

31
00:01:24,056 --> 00:01:25,729
...by eliminating Vince...

32
00:01:26,805 --> 00:01:28,721
Vince. 
Bring me your torch.

33
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:31,387
...leaving Nina alone, 
in the worst place.

34
00:01:31,387 --> 00:01:33,368
Vince, the tribe has spoken.

35
00:01:34,187 --> 00:01:37,703
There are 16 left. 
Who will be eliminated tonight?

36
00:01:56,038 --> 00:01:57,522
What happened there?

37
00:01:58,031 --> 00:01:59,699
Many things.

38
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:02,549
That snake Vince wanted 
to do it upside down.

39
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,452
I think Vince

40
00:02:04,452 --> 00:02:07,661
has woven many webs 
with all of us.

41
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,544
I wanted to follow 
the split vote plan,

42
00:02:09,544 --> 00:02:12,719
but instead, 
Will voted for Vince.

43
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,643
Frankly, I do 
n't trust him that much anymore.

44
00:02:15,643 --> 00:02:18,504
It made me a little nervous.

45
00:02:18,504 --> 00:02:20,520
I do not know. It's good, it's good.

46
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,080
- It turned out well. 
- Did you trust us?

47
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,386
If I trusted you?

48
00:02:25,985 --> 00:02:28,897
It was to the point that 
I didn't know who to trust.

49
00:02:28,897 --> 00:02:32,161
For me, what happened 
on the council... You have to think about the future.

50
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:33,778
And I didn't 
trust Vince.

51
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,790
So I extended my chances 
in this game, that's what it's all about.

52
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,875
I play chess, not checkers.

53
00:02:39,621 --> 00:02:40,930
- Yeah. 
- I know I'm next.

54
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,092
Whatever you say, 
I know you will.

55
00:02:44,092 --> 00:02:47,742
So could you just make 
me not feel left out

56
00:02:47,742 --> 00:02:49,327
waiting to fire me?

57
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:52,637
I thought we were going to 
eliminate Jenn by surprise,

58
00:02:52,637 --> 00:02:55,124
and it didn't happen, 
Will didn't follow.

59
00:02:55,124 --> 00:02:59,218
Coming to the board, 
I thought I had a solid trio.

60
00:02:59,754 --> 00:03:04,233
When I left the board, 
I had once again become an outsider.

61
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:05,693
No need to whisper behind my back.

62
00:03:05,693 --> 00:03:08,526
You know it. 
You can be here and I there,

63
00:03:08,526 --> 00:03:09,769
- I won't hear you. 
- Nina...

64
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:14,402
I can only help the tribe 
win trials.

65
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,869
It's my only way to stay.

66
00:03:15,869 --> 00:03:18,429
I know I'm next. 
I know it.

67
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:20,078
Why do you think you've already left?

68
00:03:20,078 --> 00:03:23,410
You are not going to 
eliminate each other.

69
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,139
- That's... 
- Don't give up till the end.

70
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:27,949
Did you think 
Vince was going to leave tonight?

71
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:28,943
- Yeah. 
- Exactly.

72
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:30,519
Everything can happen.

73
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:32,218
- Come on, Nina! 
- Don't give up until the end.

74
00:03:32,218 --> 00:03:33,338
- How many times... 
- Stop being like that!

75
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,069
- How many times have I... 
- Enjoy it, Nina!

76
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:38,760
Directly, Nina does her Nina, 
starts to cry,

77
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,088
is all upset 
and brings her deafness back to the surface.

78
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:45,547
Nina, you're 
only talking about your hearing!

79
00:03:45,547 --> 00:03:47,991
I got it, you're deaf. 
We all understand.

80
00:03:47,991 --> 00:03:50,346
Stop using 
it as an excuse.

81
00:04:17,275 --> 00:04:20,613
Monkey teaching White Collar 
how to live in nature.

82
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:33,493
Mom and Dad Howler Monkeys

83
00:04:33,493 --> 00:04:36,756
do somersaults.

84
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,586
You will never believe 
what I saw.

85
00:04:43,621 --> 00:04:45,115
Sex between monkeys.

86
00:04:45,115 --> 00:04:47,503
- Really ? 
- From beginning to end.

87
00:04:47,503 --> 00:04:51,556
I'll make it short for you. 
Taste.

88
00:04:51,556 --> 00:04:53,237
Shirin is crazy.

89
00:04:53,237 --> 00:04:54,979
She arrives: "Hey, friends!

90
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:58,203
Monkeys 
show their parts!".

91
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,915
That's how it is 
when a woman wants a baby.

92
00:05:02,915 --> 00:05:05,603
I'm left speechless.

93
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,278
Lots of "hoo! hoo!" 
of the male for a while.

94
00:05:09,278 --> 00:05:12,895
How can you work in 
business being this crazy?

95
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,052
No hugs afterwards, nothing.

96
00:05:15,052 --> 00:05:17,233
Nature. This is what I saw.

97
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,111
Nature should 
excite you more than that.

98
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:22,199
Shirin spent the morning 
talking about howler monkeys.

99
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:27,553
And she's just as annoying, 
loud and intrusive as they are.

100
00:05:27,553 --> 00:05:30,752
They did it again, 
three, four, five times.

101
00:05:30,752 --> 00:05:33,011
It's weird, it's strange.

102
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:35,491
She gives off something 
that doesn't stick.

103
00:05:35,491 --> 00:05:38,422
She's clearly trying 
to fit in, and it shows.

104
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:42,572
But that just paints 
a big target behind his back.

105
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:43,972
Boom!

106
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,358
Oh my God ! It tastes like water!

107
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:23,937
- This is our best water to date. 
- Yeah.

108
00:06:23,937 --> 00:06:25,662
We need to eat.

109
00:06:25,662 --> 00:06:27,288
A good fish, that sounds good to me.

110
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:30,367
- I would prefer comfort. 
- And me a blanket.

111
00:06:30,696 --> 00:06:32,863
- Really ? 
- Yes, it allows you to sleep.

112
00:06:32,863 --> 00:06:34,160
- I... 
- You sleep all night.

113
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,464
- I slept 5 hours from the beginning. 
- Bullshit.

114
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:37,798
- By night. 
- By night ?

115
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:41,144
- Never ! 
- [???]

116
00:06:41,144 --> 00:06:43,325
- [???] 
- ...hate us, because we tell the truth.

117
00:06:43,325 --> 00:06:44,764
Hate you.

118
00:06:44,764 --> 00:06:46,687
Hate us. Because we tell the truth.

119
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:49,560
That you don't like it doesn't 
change anything.

120
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,179
Oh, go to bed, Dan!

121
00:06:53,035 --> 00:06:56,562
My best trait might just 
be my worst trait.

122
00:06:56,562 --> 00:07:00,203
And it's my mouth. 
I have a hard time closing it.

123
00:07:00,203 --> 00:07:04,210
But my position is not 
as bad as before.

124
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,374
I know how to learn from my mistakes.

125
00:07:06,374 --> 00:07:10,848
Sometimes it takes an anvil 
to fall on my head, but I'm learning.

126
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:12,197
We didn't ring you.

127
00:07:12,577 --> 00:07:14,760
Yeah, and your mom [beep].

128
00:07:20,392 --> 00:07:22,439
Never mothers, brother.

129
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,192
Dan and I were laughing.

130
00:07:24,192 --> 00:07:26,657
I don't remember what I said to him, 
but he replied:

131
00:07:26,657 --> 00:07:28,037
"Your mother [beep]".

132
00:07:28,037 --> 00:07:30,831
Dan goes out of his way 
to make us laugh.

133
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:32,616
He wants to be 
on all the jokes.

134
00:07:32,616 --> 00:07:35,034
But actually, Dan, you're not funny.

135
00:07:35,034 --> 00:07:38,190
Don't talk about my mom, 
don't disrespect my family.

136
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,600
At home, if you call 
my mother a [beep],

137
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,814
then it gets serious, 
it's war,

138
00:07:42,814 --> 00:07:45,441
I'll quickly show 
up and jump down your throat.

139
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:47,016
You're lucky 
to be in Survivor.

140
00:07:48,365 --> 00:07:49,195
Candy.

141
00:07:49,195 --> 00:07:51,003
You look really serious.

142
00:07:51,787 --> 00:07:53,990
I did not think 
the emotional proletarians,

143
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,425
but these guys are.

144
00:07:56,425 --> 00:07:57,724
Watch what you say, man!

145
00:07:57,724 --> 00:07:58,905
Watch what you say!

146
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,430
As a cop, I take a step back, 
I watch and I analyze,

147
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,931
and I know when to intervene.

148
00:08:03,931 --> 00:08:07,392
Sometimes if there's a fight, 
we don't rush,

149
00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:09,393
because when 
we finally arrive,

150
00:08:09,393 --> 00:08:12,607
they fought well 
and are calmed down, appeased,

151
00:08:12,607 --> 00:08:16,388
and we arrive: 
"Okay, is that settled?".

152
00:08:16,388 --> 00:08:18,837
But Rodney likes to add more.

153
00:08:19,871 --> 00:08:21,367
Relax, everyone.

154
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,975
Dan sees himself as one of my friends.

155
00:08:24,975 --> 00:08:29,144
But he's just sinking, 
and we'll see where that takes him.

156
00:08:29,144 --> 00:08:30,809
He crossed the line.

157
00:08:31,134 --> 00:08:32,545
And not just a little.

158
00:08:48,874 --> 00:08:50,650
The waves look gorgeous.

159
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,128
- Hey say! 
- Yeah.

160
00:08:52,128 --> 00:08:54,924
- Do you want to go surfing? 
- Yeah !

161
00:08:54,924 --> 00:08:56,548
It would be nice.

162
00:08:56,548 --> 00:09:00,005
Hali and I have been watching 
these waves from the start.

163
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:01,474
Perfect rolls.

164
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,715
And it was killing us 
not being able to surf.

165
00:09:04,715 --> 00:09:06,502
So why not enjoy it ?

166
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:12,394
Driftwood is used 
as planks.

167
00:09:12,394 --> 00:09:15,786
It's rounded below, flat above.

168
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,649
It's perfect !

169
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,979
Bodysurfing 
was a great idea.

170
00:09:28,979 --> 00:09:32,835
Surfing is probably 
my 3rd passion in life.

171
00:09:32,835 --> 00:09:36,732
So when she proposed it, 
I was like, "Yeah, I got you!"

172
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,565
It is typically Colorless.

173
00:09:49,565 --> 00:09:53,406
I guarantee you the other 
tribes don't even think about it.

174
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:55,972
But Colorless 
like to have fun.

175
00:09:55,972 --> 00:09:57,461
Nothing is too serious here.

176
00:09:57,461 --> 00:10:00,215
Why is everyone taking 
this game so seriously?

177
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:12,801
What do you see ?

178
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,314
The lizard is good.

179
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:17,955
Win parts,

180
00:10:17,955 --> 00:10:21,883
paranoia seems to have diminished.

181
00:10:24,997 --> 00:10:25,980
You got it ?

182
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,043
Yeah.

183
00:10:27,364 --> 00:10:28,634
It's edible.

184
00:10:28,634 --> 00:10:32,282
It's a beautiful day, 
the waves are beautiful, everything is shining.

185
00:10:32,282 --> 00:10:34,731
Everything seems OK. I just want...

186
00:10:35,506 --> 00:10:37,708
Continue to be the provider.

187
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,404
I found the snack!

188
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:41,108
Another lizard!

189
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:45,206
Everyone stay 
in good spirits,

190
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:47,612
and develop 
camaraderie in the team.

191
00:10:47,612 --> 00:10:48,819
- I'm fine today ? 
- Yeah.

192
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:51,226
After last night? Satisfied...

193
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:52,520
- ...to be there? 
- Yeah.

194
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,264
- Glad to be here. 
- OK.

195
00:10:54,264 --> 00:10:55,655
Don't think you're not...

196
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:59,376
Welcome. I feel 
like you feel left out

197
00:10:59,376 --> 00:11:01,316
but this is not the case.

198
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:04,640
Nina, I love her, but...

199
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,570
I think she felt 
alone again.

200
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,106
I'll try to be 
a little friendlier with her.

201
00:11:10,106 --> 00:11:12,423
Keep playing, okay?

202
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:14,154
My mother was an 
interpreter for the deaf.

203
00:11:14,154 --> 00:11:17,934
My 3 sisters and I, kids, 
we learned sign language.

204
00:11:17,934 --> 00:11:21,701
I have always frequented 
the deaf community a lot.

205
00:11:21,701 --> 00:11:25,709
It's something 
I keep on hand.

206
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:26,797
It's really difficult.

207
00:11:26,797 --> 00:11:28,414
It's hard. I mean...

208
00:11:29,027 --> 00:11:32,298
I don't... 
Nobody's used to that.

209
00:11:32,298 --> 00:11:33,661
- Yeah. 
- I want you to play.

210
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:36,395
I want you to enjoy 
it and have fun with us.

211
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,022
Joe and I had a good chat.

212
00:11:38,022 --> 00:11:41,341
He just wanted to tell me 
to have some more fun.

213
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:44,030
Just keep playing, okay?

214
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:47,254
Before I lost my hearing, 
I was in sales,

215
00:11:47,254 --> 00:11:50,828
so I was white collar. 
But I am no longer.

216
00:11:50,828 --> 00:11:52,105
Listen...

217
00:11:52,105 --> 00:11:53,640
When I lost my hearing

218
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,752
having a regular job 
no longer mattered.

219
00:11:56,752 --> 00:11:59,888
So I really am 
Colorless,

220
00:11:59,888 --> 00:12:03,755
but these people are much more 
free-spirited than I am.

221
00:12:04,033 --> 00:12:05,696
Are you going to try the lizard, Nina?

222
00:12:05,696 --> 00:12:07,491
- Nope. 
- Just to taste.

223
00:12:07,772 --> 00:12:09,122
For me ! Do it !

224
00:12:09,122 --> 00:12:12,730
I discover that I have limits.

225
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,373
Take some !

226
00:12:14,716 --> 00:12:18,349
I have to change or I will leave.

227
00:12:18,349 --> 00:12:19,299
Pretty good !

228
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:20,808
I tell you, 
it doesn't look like a lizard,

229
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:22,787
looks like... Chicken.

230
00:12:22,787 --> 00:12:24,867
Come on, Nina, do it for Survivor!

231
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,205
In search of the idol.

232
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,452
It's about spotting 
something that stands out.

233
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:51,502
She must be here.

234
00:12:56,006 --> 00:12:59,516
The whole tribe searches for the idol.

235
00:13:00,038 --> 00:13:01,789
So I watch the fire.

236
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:03,046
I am relaxing.

237
00:13:03,665 --> 00:13:04,990
I rather enjoy myself.

238
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,085
Because I already have the idol.

239
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:09,421
So I don't 
need to look for her.

240
00:13:10,225 --> 00:13:11,331
Funny !

241
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,791
Could we say that we stop?

242
00:13:18,296 --> 00:13:19,833
Could we have a truce?

243
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:23,489
Win the next event, 
wait for the next clue to search?

244
00:13:25,488 --> 00:13:27,263
- Hey, Joak! 
- What's new ?

245
00:13:28,076 --> 00:13:31,991
Do we make a truce and 
only look for it after the ordeal?

246
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:33,806
When do we get another clue?

247
00:13:34,218 --> 00:13:36,769
Since you're looking for her 
more than anyone...

248
00:13:37,211 --> 00:13:38,256
Not really.

249
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:40,164
She says she's gonna stop

250
00:13:40,164 --> 00:13:41,345
- if we all do it. 
- Good.

251
00:13:41,345 --> 00:13:43,695
The problem is, 
I never trusted you.

252
00:13:44,588 --> 00:13:47,188
If you're tired of searching, 
go sit down.

253
00:13:47,537 --> 00:13:49,636
You do not trust me ? 
From the beginning ?

254
00:13:49,636 --> 00:13:50,617
- Yeah. 
- Why ?

255
00:13:50,617 --> 00:13:52,917
Because you are paranoid

256
00:13:53,504 --> 00:13:56,901
and that you panicked 
for no reason from day one.

257
00:13:56,901 --> 00:13:58,298
- Really ? 
- I do not remember.

258
00:13:58,298 --> 00:13:59,569
What did I say?

259
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,114
What did you say ?

260
00:14:02,114 --> 00:14:05,026
Shirin is like a leech 
that won't let go

261
00:14:05,026 --> 00:14:07,236
and the most annoying person 
I've ever met.

262
00:14:07,236 --> 00:14:08,858
It's like mosquitoes, 
at night,

263
00:14:08,858 --> 00:14:14,099
constantly ringing 
in your ears, and...

264
00:14:14,845 --> 00:14:15,884
Lord !

265
00:14:15,884 --> 00:14:17,174
Why do not you talk to me ?

266
00:14:17,587 --> 00:14:19,961
I'm busy 
looking for something.

267
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:21,267
As you should.

268
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:23,368
Should I? Why this ?

269
00:14:24,711 --> 00:14:26,359
Joaquin was not himself.

270
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:29,214
There was fury 
behind his words.

271
00:14:29,214 --> 00:14:31,680
Which turns out great for me,

272
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,159
because that means he ca 
n't maneuver in this game.

273
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,864
What is the problem ? 
Why can't we go back?

274
00:14:35,864 --> 00:14:38,299
You just have to go home. 
I don't need a babysitter.

275
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:41,310
I'm in a bad position 
and I can't find the idol.

276
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,490
I will do 
what will benefit me in the long run.

277
00:14:46,347 --> 00:14:48,613
Tyler and I 
have good contact.

278
00:14:48,613 --> 00:14:50,423
So I showed him the clue.

279
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:52,501
He's my boy, 
he has to see him.

280
00:14:52,501 --> 00:14:54,975
"Near 
where you quench your thirst,

281
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,819
you will satisfy 
your craving for power.

282
00:14:56,819 --> 00:15:00,080
It's tucked away in a corner, 
no need to climb."

283
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,128
Joaq showed me 
the clue to find the idol.

284
00:15:03,128 --> 00:15:06,333
On the second day, 
Carolyn showed me the idol.

285
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:11,248
But it was important that Joaq 
show me this confidence.

286
00:15:11,248 --> 00:15:14,455
I appreciate you taking 
this step of trust, and...

287
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,754
- You're my man. 
- I want to win, bro.

288
00:15:16,754 --> 00:15:17,814
Go on...

289
00:15:17,814 --> 00:15:20,786
When you make the effort 
to show this to someone,

290
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,441
it brings a form of unity.

291
00:15:24,349 --> 00:15:25,833
Here they are again!

292
00:15:26,153 --> 00:15:27,813
Even if Joaquin 
is in a bad position,

293
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:30,249
So far, 
I get on well with him.

294
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:34,284
And Shirin, at this point... 
We're as crazy as we look.

295
00:15:34,284 --> 00:15:37,573
Between nudity, 
discussions with monkeys

296
00:15:37,573 --> 00:15:39,875
and the fact 
that she never closes it,

297
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:43,310
I have the impression 
that if we lose the test,

298
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,617
Shirin will be at the top 
of everyone's list.

299
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,882
The man I call Dad 
is the pastor of my church,

300
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:07,887
and he taught me very early

301
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:10,822
that if you work hard, 
you will be rewarded.

302
00:16:10,822 --> 00:16:13,342
So no need to tell me 
to do something,

303
00:16:13,342 --> 00:16:15,836
because when I see that something 
must be done,

304
00:16:15,836 --> 00:16:17,398
I do.

305
00:16:18,765 --> 00:16:21,449
But this tribe 
of work blues,

306
00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:25,633
supposed to have the best 
work ethic of the three tribes,

307
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:28,474
fails on this ground.

308
00:16:28,474 --> 00:16:31,485
And Rodney seems the worst to me.

309
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:34,696
Rod, do you want to help us 
carry this wood?

310
00:16:34,696 --> 00:16:36,077
Yeah, when I've eaten.

311
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:37,373
I am dizzy.

312
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,517
- You know what I mean ? 
- Yes perfectly.

313
00:16:40,805 --> 00:16:42,718
I will work when 
I feel like it. How are you?

314
00:16:42,718 --> 00:16:45,261
No one is my father here, 
as far as you know.

315
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:46,796
There is work.

316
00:16:47,748 --> 00:16:49,729
Mike makes his remarks 
and I think to myself:

317
00:16:49,729 --> 00:16:51,342
"Okay, that's annoying."

318
00:16:51,342 --> 00:16:55,311
"Be careful what you say, 
because you're not the only one getting high."

319
00:16:55,594 --> 00:16:58,744
We worked all morning 
without a thank you.

320
00:16:58,744 --> 00:17:01,449
We work blues, 
in general,

321
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:04,440
we tend to criticize 
the work ethic of others,

322
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,202
because we think 
ours is the best,

323
00:17:06,202 --> 00:17:09,561
that we know how to do it best 
and that we work the hardest.

324
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:16,171
Sometimes it does 
n't matter much.

325
00:17:16,171 --> 00:17:18,142
But in the end,

326
00:17:18,607 --> 00:17:21,542
I know in this tribe 
I have the best work ethic.

327
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:23,045
Everyone must do their part.

328
00:17:23,045 --> 00:17:25,914
I know, but... 
Not when Mike decides.

329
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:27,183
Not when Mike decides.

330
00:17:27,183 --> 00:17:29,171
We will when we do.

331
00:17:29,603 --> 00:17:32,555
If I go first for going 
ahead and saying something,

332
00:17:32,555 --> 00:17:34,206
at least I would have.

333
00:17:34,206 --> 00:17:36,263
Guess what ? 
There's no need to work

334
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,906
all day, every day.

335
00:17:37,906 --> 00:17:39,555
We won two races in a row.

336
00:17:39,555 --> 00:17:40,760
No need to be on a mission 
every day,

337
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,124
like you from 8 o'clock. 
We have all day to work.

338
00:17:44,124 --> 00:17:46,177
Relax, each at their own pace.

339
00:17:46,177 --> 00:17:49,567
You take yourself for the captain. 
Is there a "C" on your shirt?

340
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,239
Are you the team captain?

341
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:52,294
So relax!

342
00:17:52,294 --> 00:17:55,459
Relax ! I'll get 
that fucking wood anytime I want.

343
00:17:55,459 --> 00:17:56,965
You're not my father, damn it!

344
00:17:56,965 --> 00:17:58,528
- So put your ass down! 
- No, I'm not your father.

345
00:17:58,528 --> 00:18:00,318
"Hey, Rodney, get some wood!"

346
00:18:00,318 --> 00:18:02,868
Whether it's 10 minutes, 
20 or an hour, I'll go.

347
00:18:02,868 --> 00:18:06,337
But don't tell me 
"here and now", or I won't go.

348
00:18:06,337 --> 00:18:09,630
Everyone here 
is stuck with it, for now.

349
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,070
But they all say 
the same thing as me.

350
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,094
I am dizzy. 
Look at me !

351
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,417
I tremble.

352
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:18,180
Let me eat 
and I'll come help you!

353
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,262
But you want to decide when.

354
00:18:20,262 --> 00:18:21,288
Just let me eat!

355
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:23,585
When I have my energy, 
I will.

356
00:18:23,585 --> 00:18:25,660
I'm upset, there's a reason. 
I am motivated and dedicated.

357
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,174
I will do what you want.

358
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:28,654
But wait until I'm ready.

359
00:18:28,654 --> 00:18:30,094
Not that Mike is ready.

360
00:18:30,548 --> 00:18:32,649
Rodney will do what he wants.

361
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:35,147
OK ? It doesn't matter 
how high you get.

362
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,853
It's a social game. Whether you make 
a maximum or a minimum,

363
00:18:37,853 --> 00:18:39,168
it won't get you through.

364
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:40,676
You have to keep a good mood.

365
00:18:40,676 --> 00:18:42,079
But let me go.

366
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,489
Sorry, I didn't know 
you felt bad.

367
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:45,824
No matter.

368
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,001
Nobody tells me what to do.

369
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,425
That's why 
I work alone, you know?

370
00:18:48,425 --> 00:18:51,164
- I see. 
- I will when I want.

371
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:52,175
At the time chosen by Rodney.

372
00:18:52,175 --> 00:18:54,508
This game... We're not 
on an oil rig.

373
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,080
"Platform workers,

374
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,338
you have to work really hard,

375
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:00,830
and if not, you'll be fired."

376
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,430
No, it's a game, 
everyone should have fun.

377
00:19:04,837 --> 00:19:07,086
I'm not a slob. 
I didn't grow up in that environment.

378
00:19:07,086 --> 00:19:08,046
- You understand me ? 
- Absolutely.

379
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:11,182
I don't live that way. Maybe him, 
with his $100,000 ranch.

380
00:19:11,182 --> 00:19:12,715
Because that's 
the value of Texas.

381
00:19:12,715 --> 00:19:14,024
In Massachusetts, 
a house is worth $400,000.

382
00:19:14,024 --> 00:19:15,600
- Thanks. 
- Because people want to live there.

383
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,685
Nobody wants to live in Texas! 
OK ?

384
00:19:17,685 --> 00:19:19,449
Mike is the number one target here.

385
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,145
I must remain discreet,

386
00:19:21,145 --> 00:19:22,994
focus on my three "C's",

387
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:24,649
Cool, Calm and Cooperative,

388
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:25,917
and it will be paradise.

389
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:27,766
I will make a pile of wood

390
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:28,774
under that fucking tree,

391
00:19:28,774 --> 00:19:31,383
and that no one asks me 
to go get any more.

392
00:19:31,383 --> 00:19:34,534
All of this largely 
started yesterday, for me.

393
00:19:34,534 --> 00:19:38,187
Every time 
I feel like I'm getting high

394
00:19:38,187 --> 00:19:40,051
- to do a lot of stuff... 
- But so are we!

395
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:41,526
Wait, wait. 
Can I finish?

396
00:19:41,526 --> 00:19:44,217
I let you finish, 
I would like to finish.

397
00:19:47,427 --> 00:19:50,866
I don't feel 
like the respect I give you

398
00:19:50,866 --> 00:19:52,699
be given back to me.

399
00:19:52,699 --> 00:19:55,170
If anyone gets 
respect here, it's you.

400
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,805
Certainly not us.

401
00:19:57,805 --> 00:19:59,349
Do you think 
I don't respect you?

402
00:19:59,349 --> 00:20:02,969
When was the last time you said thank you for 
something we did?

403
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,000
- Every day. 
- When ?

404
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,405
- Every day. 
- When ?

405
00:20:06,729 --> 00:20:09,691
- Every day. 
- Name one... Name one.

406
00:20:09,691 --> 00:20:11,621
'Cause we been doing this shit 
all morning

407
00:20:11,621 --> 00:20:13,426
and you come back and you laugh.

408
00:20:13,426 --> 00:20:16,082
- "My laundry is not done?" 
- That's my humble opinion.

409
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:17,836
- "Thank you for doing my laundry." 
- When do you say thank you for fishing?

410
00:20:17,836 --> 00:20:19,509
When do you say thank you 
for the wood?

411
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,315
- When do you say thank you...? 
- Everytime.

412
00:20:21,315 --> 00:20:23,860
Everytime ! And every time 
we looked for wood,

413
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,930
we were there! Every time !

414
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,458
Each time, 
we helped with the wood!

415
00:20:30,246 --> 00:20:33,638
Mike is a big ignoramus there. 
I can't stand that.

416
00:20:33,638 --> 00:20:37,013
And of course, 
he wants to argue with me.

417
00:20:37,013 --> 00:20:39,828
I know you got a 
bible verse on your back,

418
00:20:39,828 --> 00:20:43,066
but that doesn't help 
take care of the fire.

419
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:46,056
Everyone is doing their part, 
I really mean it.

420
00:20:46,056 --> 00:20:48,691
We're not looking for wood. 
True or false ?

421
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,165
Yeah, there you go.

422
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,887
We don't cook. True or false ?

423
00:20:51,887 --> 00:20:53,000
You cook all the time.

424
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,496
- Are we taking care of the fire? 
- And I appreciate it.

425
00:20:54,496 --> 00:20:55,496
Do we take care of the fire?

426
00:20:55,912 --> 00:20:58,752
Shall we fetch water? 
We don't take care of the fire?

427
00:20:58,752 --> 00:21:02,267
And how do you think 
that fucking fire is burning here?

428
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,576
Did it happen by magic?

429
00:21:05,576 --> 00:21:09,319
Your god? He went downstairs to do that 
with his fucking beard?

430
00:21:12,826 --> 00:21:15,717
I don't claim to be 
the best Christian in the world,

431
00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:18,300
but I have a relationship with God.

432
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:20,991
It was very offensive to me.

433
00:21:20,991 --> 00:21:25,006
Honestly, it hurt me 
on a personal level.

434
00:21:25,006 --> 00:21:29,281
Like I said, if my 
stepping up and talking is my downfall,

435
00:21:29,281 --> 00:21:30,525
well get rid of me!

436
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:35,234
Mike always says, "If you want 
to fire me for this, do it!"

437
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,906
Wishes come true, asshole!

438
00:21:38,562 --> 00:21:39,740
Sorry !

439
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:59,372
Over here everyone!

440
00:22:15,453 --> 00:22:17,072
White Collars, Overalls,

441
00:22:17,072 --> 00:22:20,588
discover the new 
Sans Couleur tribe.

442
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:23,736
Vince was eliminated 
at the last council.

443
00:22:29,745 --> 00:22:32,127
Ready for 
today's immunity test?

444
00:22:32,127 --> 00:22:33,318
Yeah !

445
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:35,767
First, 
I collect the idols.

446
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:37,363
Rendez-la, Shirin!

447
00:22:37,363 --> 00:22:38,664
I will take it!

448
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:47,952
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

449
00:22:47,952 --> 00:22:52,177
Today each tribe 
will carry a large bucket

450
00:22:52,177 --> 00:22:55,118
to a water tower, 
where you will fill it.

451
00:22:55,788 --> 00:23:01,036
You will come back trying 
to plug as many holes as possible,

452
00:23:01,036 --> 00:23:03,301
to prevent water leaks.

453
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:07,120
You will pour what remains 
in a barrel and leave.

454
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,926
The first two tribes 
to fill their barrel

455
00:23:11,121 --> 00:23:12,651
and raise their flag

456
00:23:13,098 --> 00:23:15,039
gain immunity and reward.

457
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,609
- Do you want to know what's at stake? 
- Yes.

458
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:21,389
Besides not going to the council, 
the first tribe to finish...

459
00:23:22,282 --> 00:23:25,526
A huge comfort reward.

460
00:23:26,398 --> 00:23:28,719
Oh my God !

461
00:23:29,494 --> 00:23:30,833
Chairs !

462
00:23:31,963 --> 00:23:33,733
Chairs, blankets, 
pillows,

463
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:35,162
candles, rope

464
00:23:35,162 --> 00:23:36,472
and a tarp.

465
00:23:36,472 --> 00:23:39,436
It will change your life 
on the camp.

466
00:23:39,754 --> 00:23:41,890
For the second tribe 
to finish: not as many,

467
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,730
but still very useful.

468
00:23:44,331 --> 00:23:46,131
- A tarp. 
- Yeah.

469
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:49,829
For the last, nothing but 
a meeting with me at the council,

470
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:54,040
where someone will be the third 
person eliminated from the game.

471
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,987
Overalls, 
you are one more.

472
00:23:55,987 --> 00:24:00,352
Someone will not participate. 
It's whoever you want. So ?

473
00:24:01,153 --> 00:24:02,829
Lindsey will not participate.

474
00:24:02,829 --> 00:24:05,479
Everyone else, one minute 
to get organized and we'll get started.

475
00:24:13,928 --> 00:24:16,578
Let's go. For immunity 
and reward.

476
00:24:16,578 --> 00:24:17,957
Survivors, ready?

477
00:24:21,236 --> 00:24:24,676
The White Collars fly over the obstacle 
and throw their bucket.

478
00:24:25,216 --> 00:24:26,898
Will, immediately in trouble.

479
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:29,737
The Colorless 
are already behind.

480
00:24:30,516 --> 00:24:32,303
The basics are very simple.

481
00:24:33,154 --> 00:24:35,187
Fill your bucket with water

482
00:24:35,424 --> 00:24:38,571
and try to bring back 
as many as possible

483
00:24:38,571 --> 00:24:40,364
before she escapes.

484
00:24:40,634 --> 00:24:43,715
Put your hands down, 
you're not plugging the holes.

485
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:45,289
- Go ahead ! 
- I go ahead and I come back?

486
00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:46,114
Yeah.

487
00:24:46,826 --> 00:24:49,396
Joe sends Nina forward.

488
00:24:49,396 --> 00:24:53,729
A potentially 
very clever strategy, if it pays off.

489
00:24:54,777 --> 00:24:56,057
The Work Blues are back.

490
00:24:56,057 --> 00:24:57,809
It's good, friends!

491
00:24:57,809 --> 00:24:59,976
Bring it back quickly!

492
00:24:59,976 --> 00:25:01,176
Go on !

493
00:25:01,621 --> 00:25:03,128
Here are the White Collars!

494
00:25:03,955 --> 00:25:04,789
Go on !

495
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:06,469
The Colorless are back!

496
00:25:06,469 --> 00:25:08,621
The goal is teamwork.

497
00:25:08,621 --> 00:25:11,854
The more holes you plug, 
the more water you will have

498
00:25:11,854 --> 00:25:13,303
to pour into your barrel,

499
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:16,073
and you will therefore have 
fewer trips to make.

500
00:25:16,073 --> 00:25:17,355
Reverse it!

501
00:25:19,624 --> 00:25:21,394
The White Collars 
have their first bucket.

502
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,424
Go on !

503
00:25:23,227 --> 00:25:24,808
The Colorless are very slow,

504
00:25:24,808 --> 00:25:28,822
but it doesn't matter, 
if they plug the holes.

505
00:25:30,966 --> 00:25:34,333
The Colorless pour half 
of their water on the ground!

506
00:25:41,865 --> 00:25:43,577
Here are the work blues.

507
00:25:45,995 --> 00:25:47,098
- Go ahead ! 
- I go.

508
00:25:47,415 --> 00:25:49,379
Again, Nina goes ahead.

509
00:25:49,379 --> 00:25:52,707
I don't understand 
why she's not participating.

510
00:25:56,412 --> 00:26:02,217
The Colorless, again 
very slow, and at only four,

511
00:26:02,217 --> 00:26:04,284
when they are five.

512
00:26:04,586 --> 00:26:07,623
What you're doing 
doesn't work, Colorless!

513
00:26:08,682 --> 00:26:11,211
Les Bleus de Travail, back 
with a new bucket full of water.

514
00:26:11,211 --> 00:26:13,676
The White Collars, 
back with a bucket.

515
00:26:15,356 --> 00:26:16,795
- One more, come on! 
- Its good ?

516
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:20,171
They leave.

517
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:23,189
For some reason,

518
00:26:23,189 --> 00:26:25,156
the Colorless find it logical

519
00:26:25,156 --> 00:26:27,731
that Nina is not participating.

520
00:26:27,731 --> 00:26:28,733
On and go!

521
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:30,261
The Work Blues are back.

522
00:26:32,912 --> 00:26:34,591
Here are the White Collars.

523
00:26:36,123 --> 00:26:38,618
- Go on ! 
- Will is exhausted.

524
00:26:38,618 --> 00:26:40,082
- Go Will! 
- Its good.

525
00:26:40,082 --> 00:26:42,387
- It's the Whites and the Blues... 
- It's their last bucket!

526
00:26:42,387 --> 00:26:45,165
- It's their last bucket! 
- ...like the last time,

527
00:26:45,165 --> 00:26:47,414
vying for first place.

528
00:26:47,414 --> 00:26:50,569
Quick ! Quick ! 
We must beat them!

529
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:52,126
You must beat them!

530
00:26:52,126 --> 00:26:53,134
This may be the end.

531
00:26:55,422 --> 00:26:56,365
Go on ! Go on !

532
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:59,373
Will that be enough?

533
00:27:00,907 --> 00:27:03,216
Nope ! The White Collars 
must go back!

534
00:27:06,742 --> 00:27:10,245
- One again ! 
- Not enough for the Blues! Go away!

535
00:27:10,245 --> 00:27:12,877
It's very tight 
between Blues and Whites.

536
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,709
Every drop of water 
left in this bucket

537
00:27:16,709 --> 00:27:18,097
can make a difference!

538
00:27:20,343 --> 00:27:23,545
Nina finally helps, 
for the first time.

539
00:27:23,545 --> 00:27:24,714
A little more.

540
00:27:26,343 --> 00:27:28,342
Let's go!

541
00:27:28,692 --> 00:27:31,279
- Go for it ! 
- The Blues are back! Is this the end?

542
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,057
The Whites are coming back, 
maybe it's the end for them.

543
00:27:34,394 --> 00:27:36,866
How much water 
can they hold?

544
00:27:39,403 --> 00:27:40,850
Run!

545
00:27:41,531 --> 00:27:43,019
Dan, over!

546
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:44,170
Don't stop!

547
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,128
Another bucket for the Colorless.

548
00:27:48,093 --> 00:27:49,829
Nice, but not enough.

549
00:27:49,829 --> 00:27:51,440
- The Colorless leave. 
- Ahead !

550
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,403
Here are the work blues!

551
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:56,341
Would it be victory? 
Here are the White Collars!

552
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,856
Yes ! Worker's Blues 
win immunity and reward!

553
00:28:07,982 --> 00:28:11,466
Yes ! White Collar 
earn immunity and reward,

554
00:28:11,466 --> 00:28:14,624
sending the Colorless back 
to the council.

555
00:28:23,796 --> 00:28:26,019
Overalls, nice finish!

556
00:28:26,019 --> 00:28:27,732
Go get her!

557
00:28:27,732 --> 00:28:29,739
Again, no advice.

558
00:28:29,739 --> 00:28:32,657
no one will leave the Bleus de Travail tribe .

559
00:28:34,107 --> 00:28:37,554
White collars! 
Again, a nice finish.

560
00:28:38,806 --> 00:28:40,737
This tribe remains intact.

561
00:28:41,848 --> 00:28:44,686
Overalls, come get 
your big reward.

562
00:28:44,686 --> 00:28:46,107
Return to camp.

563
00:28:46,736 --> 00:28:47,872
Pillows!

564
00:28:51,341 --> 00:28:54,012
- Thank you Jeff! 
- Oh my God, friends!

565
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:57,018
White collar, no advice.

566
00:28:57,018 --> 00:29:00,179
Come and get your tarp, 
take your things and leave.

567
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:01,921
- Thanks ! 
- Congratulation.

568
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:11,013
Without Color, you lose 
for the second consecutive time.

569
00:29:11,013 --> 00:29:13,805
But this time, it seems to 
have been a strategic error.

570
00:29:13,805 --> 00:29:16,919
Joe, why did you ask Nina

571
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:19,949
not to help 
plug the holes?

572
00:29:20,296 --> 00:29:22,841
We thought we 
might go faster

573
00:29:22,841 --> 00:29:25,015
by placing Nina after the obstacles,

574
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:26,942
so that she plugs 
the holes afterwards.

575
00:29:26,942 --> 00:29:29,133
Maybe it was a bad choice, 
in retrospect,

576
00:29:29,133 --> 00:29:31,486
but it seemed like 
the best idea at the time.

577
00:29:31,766 --> 00:29:33,470
Colorless, get your stuff, 
go back to camp.

578
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,900
See you tonight at the council.

579
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,345
I thought I was in the army, 
it was nonsense.

580
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:41,177
This ordeal 
really tore me apart.

581
00:29:41,177 --> 00:29:42,945
She tore me down.

582
00:29:42,945 --> 00:29:46,091
Alas, we have to 
go back to the council,

583
00:29:46,091 --> 00:29:48,197
and I think 
Nina's time has come.

584
00:30:14,032 --> 00:30:15,352
I just want to say...

585
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:17,654
I am sorry.

586
00:30:17,654 --> 00:30:20,057
I take responsibility.

587
00:30:20,057 --> 00:30:21,813
I don't know what I was thinking.

588
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:25,258
- I feel especially bad... 
- I didn't know...

589
00:30:25,258 --> 00:30:26,928
- No, but I... 
- ...that you made that choice.

590
00:30:26,928 --> 00:30:28,888
Because you thought 
I couldn't.

591
00:30:28,888 --> 00:30:30,844
- It's true, and I... 
- And I could have...

592
00:30:30,844 --> 00:30:33,099
- I am really sorry. 
- I thought...

593
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:34,907
I'm really, really sorry.

594
00:30:34,907 --> 00:30:37,826
I should never have 
made that decision.

595
00:30:37,826 --> 00:30:39,841
We were so close today.

596
00:30:39,841 --> 00:30:41,879
I feel a little responsible,

597
00:30:41,879 --> 00:30:44,936
because I decided 
the game strategy.

598
00:30:44,936 --> 00:30:48,697
I should have closed it 
and let Nina participate.

599
00:30:48,697 --> 00:30:50,328
I regret this decision,

600
00:30:50,328 --> 00:30:52,535
because I screwed her up.

601
00:30:52,535 --> 00:30:56,317
I know she doesn't want 
to leave. Nobody wants it.

602
00:30:56,317 --> 00:30:58,949
So if she wants to fight, 
she will fight.

603
00:30:58,949 --> 00:31:00,884
- I should have followed my instincts. 
- Nope.

604
00:31:00,884 --> 00:31:03,135
"Want some help 
plugging the holes?"

605
00:31:03,135 --> 00:31:04,858
- But no... 
- You said: "No, go ahead!"

606
00:31:04,858 --> 00:31:07,719
and I was like, "I should stay, 
help plug these holes."

607
00:31:07,719 --> 00:31:10,208
Absolutely. I am really sorry.

608
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:12,648
I feel bad about... 
You know.

609
00:31:12,648 --> 00:31:15,300
For assuming 
she would slow us down.

610
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,750
It was a mistake.

611
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,414
I feel really bad.

612
00:31:18,859 --> 00:31:19,972
Life is learning.

613
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,206
We screwed up again.

614
00:31:22,206 --> 00:31:25,969
We tried to avoid 
Nina being a factor.

615
00:31:26,403 --> 00:31:27,719
This is the result.

616
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,127
And so, 
to the council we return.

617
00:31:30,502 --> 00:31:32,142
It's not your fault.

618
00:31:32,142 --> 00:31:33,161
- It's just... 
- It's a game.

619
00:31:33,161 --> 00:31:35,693
- I know I know. 
- What are we playing?

620
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:36,892
- What are we playing? 
- To Survivor.

621
00:31:36,892 --> 00:31:38,889
- OK. Are we playing "Friends"? 
- Nope...

622
00:31:38,889 --> 00:31:40,499
- Good. 
- It's just... Just that...

623
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:42,099
- No no. 
- ...I don't like losing.

624
00:31:42,099 --> 00:31:43,974
Neither do I.

625
00:31:44,284 --> 00:31:46,287
- But it was a team choice. 
- Yeah.

626
00:31:46,287 --> 00:31:47,631
And I supported you.

627
00:31:47,631 --> 00:31:48,839
I supported you.

628
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:51,374
She's been a dead weight 
for a while.

629
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,631
Do you agree to eliminate it?

630
00:31:53,631 --> 00:31:54,789
Absolutely.

631
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:56,048
And you, Hali?

632
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:57,220
It's clear.

633
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:05,476
How do you think the vote will turn 
out tonight?

634
00:32:06,104 --> 00:32:07,744
No idea.

635
00:32:07,744 --> 00:32:10,344
- Sorry ? 
- I say: no idea.

636
00:32:10,957 --> 00:32:13,545
I think tonight 
is between Will and me.

637
00:32:13,545 --> 00:32:18,660
Because the three in control 
are Joe, Jenn and Hali.

638
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:22,548
So I have to convince them 
to eliminate Will instead of me.

639
00:32:23,148 --> 00:32:26,072
Have you discussed 
who you want to eliminate?

640
00:32:26,072 --> 00:32:28,725
Will was in pain today.

641
00:32:29,512 --> 00:32:30,918
Are you going to vote Will?

642
00:32:31,339 --> 00:32:33,324
Yes, if that's what you do.

643
00:32:34,805 --> 00:32:38,048
- And you ? 
- It's been 2 events in a row that he is zero.

644
00:32:38,048 --> 00:32:41,141
One test, still passes, 
but two, no.

645
00:32:41,141 --> 00:32:43,426
Nina and Will 
won't be long.

646
00:32:43,426 --> 00:32:45,907
Will failed in the event.

647
00:32:45,907 --> 00:32:49,650
It was awkward. And I still do 
n't really trust him.

648
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:52,650
No way. He looks sly. 
But OK...

649
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:55,596
Nina is the killjoy of the team.

650
00:32:55,596 --> 00:32:58,917
Both Will and Nina are 
equally bad at proofs.

651
00:32:58,917 --> 00:33:01,183
- I agree. 
- Like, Will sucks.

652
00:33:01,183 --> 00:33:04,856
The other day, Will took longer 
than her to swim from the boat.

653
00:33:04,856 --> 00:33:07,257
It's true. 
I thought he was going to die.

654
00:33:07,613 --> 00:33:11,573
Nina is really frail, 
and her attitude sucks.

655
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:14,626
But Will has a lot of trouble.

656
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:16,802
How about you and me 
voting Will?

657
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:21,146
Will voted wrong on the last council.

658
00:33:21,146 --> 00:33:24,014
I don't trust him anymore, 
he's a snake.

659
00:33:24,014 --> 00:33:27,291
My biggest fear, 
in the medium term,

660
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:30,166
it's that Will 
is doing something stupid

661
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:34,424
and that Jenn and I get 
in trouble at the merger.

662
00:33:34,424 --> 00:33:37,610
We're between a rock 
and a hard place here.

663
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:40,376
Who's going to go, Will or Nina?

664
00:34:02,215 --> 00:34:05,509
Let's talk about the previous advice.

665
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:07,559
It seemed to revolve 
around trust,

666
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:10,501
and ended 
with Vince being eliminated, seemingly by surprise.

667
00:34:10,501 --> 00:34:14,568
But it looked like Vince 
wasn't the only one surprised.

668
00:34:14,568 --> 00:34:16,699
Will, when you return to camp,

669
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:18,518
was there 
anything to clarify?

670
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,448
Yes, more or less.

671
00:34:20,448 --> 00:34:24,579
I had to follow someone 
I trust, hence my vote.

672
00:34:25,281 --> 00:34:29,000
Joe, it's interesting 
that this game has so many levels.

673
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,438
Because you are still 
in the "tribes" part of the game.

674
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:34,097
Yet you are already playing 
the individual part of the game.

675
00:34:34,097 --> 00:34:36,669
And those trust issues 
might come back

676
00:34:36,669 --> 00:34:38,860
if your tribe remains intact.

677
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,091
Absolutely.

678
00:34:40,091 --> 00:34:42,260
You only have one 
or two chances,

679
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:45,296
when you make mistakes, 
correct them.

680
00:34:45,296 --> 00:34:48,733
So yes, trust 
is a very important factor,

681
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:51,868
to keep alliances 
as strong as possible

682
00:34:51,868 --> 00:34:53,495
while progressing in the game.

683
00:34:53,806 --> 00:34:56,006
Let's talk about today's race.

684
00:34:56,006 --> 00:34:59,766
Your strategy to keep Nina 
out of the test

685
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:01,491
was difficult to understand.

686
00:35:01,491 --> 00:35:03,292
Joe, what was the logic?

687
00:35:03,292 --> 00:35:07,414
Getting 5 people 
through the ladder was tricky.

688
00:35:07,414 --> 00:35:09,720
Nina was in danger of tripping, falling

689
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,212
and take everything 
with it, so...

690
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:14,905
Yeah, I screwed up pretty bad today.

691
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:17,825
But what's left for you, Nina,

692
00:35:17,825 --> 00:35:20,015
it's the fact that they 
didn't believe in you enough

693
00:35:20,015 --> 00:35:22,759
- to let you play. 
- Exactly.

694
00:35:22,759 --> 00:35:24,906
It really showed me

695
00:35:24,906 --> 00:35:27,837
that because of my...disadvantage,

696
00:35:28,536 --> 00:35:32,226
they don't trust 
me for anything.

697
00:35:32,226 --> 00:35:34,669
But hearing played 
no role in this test.

698
00:35:34,669 --> 00:35:38,219
I think they see me, 
as a person,

699
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,917
as disadvantaged.

700
00:35:39,917 --> 00:35:43,303
Whether it's my ears, 
my feet or whatever.

701
00:35:43,303 --> 00:35:45,393
- Because you're deaf? 
- Yes.

702
00:35:46,387 --> 00:35:47,772
I do not agree.

703
00:35:48,257 --> 00:35:50,786
No matter how many times 
we take Nina aside

704
00:35:50,786 --> 00:35:53,226
to re-motivate 
her, restore her morale,

705
00:35:53,226 --> 00:35:56,292
we always come back to his deafness.

706
00:35:56,292 --> 00:35:59,327
That's what irritates me, 
because we're trying hard.

707
00:35:59,887 --> 00:36:02,756
Joe, 
something is happening in Survivor:

708
00:36:02,756 --> 00:36:06,001
perception becomes reality.

709
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:08,393
Whatever 
the perception of the group,

710
00:36:08,393 --> 00:36:11,233
it is real and true 
for its members.

711
00:36:11,233 --> 00:36:13,199
Yes, she also misunderstands us

712
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:15,684
that she thinks is misunderstood.

713
00:36:15,684 --> 00:36:18,047
I know many deaf people.

714
00:36:18,047 --> 00:36:22,287
I'll be the last to judge 
you or anyone on a disability.

715
00:36:23,328 --> 00:36:25,410
Will, I saw you after the ordeal.

716
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:26,687
You were out of breath.

717
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:29,401
Do you have reason 
to worry?

718
00:36:29,401 --> 00:36:32,862
I had trouble in 
the second event, with the buoy.

719
00:36:32,862 --> 00:36:35,257
When I got back, I said, 
"It's my fault."

720
00:36:35,257 --> 00:36:38,532
I think that today, 
at team level,

721
00:36:38,532 --> 00:36:39,466
it did not work.

722
00:36:39,466 --> 00:36:42,159
But they know 
what I bring to the tribe,

723
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,849
and I'm counting on it.

724
00:36:44,312 --> 00:36:46,627
You'd be crazy to keep Will.

725
00:36:47,222 --> 00:36:50,365
Seriously. You can 
trust me, I'm strong.

726
00:36:50,365 --> 00:36:51,924
I can win events.

727
00:36:51,924 --> 00:36:54,863
You didn't let 
me show you what I can do.

728
00:36:54,863 --> 00:36:57,884
But you were often 
emotionally weak,

729
00:36:57,884 --> 00:36:59,234
and that worries me a bit.

730
00:36:59,234 --> 00:37:01,545
I know it's hard for you,

731
00:37:01,545 --> 00:37:02,648
but it's hard for everyone.

732
00:37:02,648 --> 00:37:05,124
We all have our problems.

733
00:37:07,972 --> 00:37:09,345
Stack at the right time!

734
00:37:10,167 --> 00:37:13,572
Hali, could it be that Nina 
is in the wrong tribe?

735
00:37:13,572 --> 00:37:15,046
She may not be 
Colorless.

736
00:37:15,046 --> 00:37:18,977
I wonder. This philosophy 
of taking life as it comes,

737
00:37:18,977 --> 00:37:22,613
we know how to handle 
the ups and downs.

738
00:37:22,613 --> 00:37:25,928
For the most part, in 
this tribe, we let ourselves go.

739
00:37:25,928 --> 00:37:30,159
But Nina 
doesn't work like that.

740
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:34,064
And yet, Nina, I know 
you see yourself as Colorless,

741
00:37:34,064 --> 00:37:39,356
a flexible person who tries 
to vary points of view.

742
00:37:39,356 --> 00:37:41,545
Before losing his hearing,

743
00:37:41,545 --> 00:37:45,026
I had a lot of jobs 
where I supervised people.

744
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:47,497
I had the responsibility

745
00:37:48,294 --> 00:37:49,693
a lot of money,

746
00:37:49,693 --> 00:37:51,473
I made budgets,

747
00:37:51,473 --> 00:37:55,170
and that's been 44 years of my life.

748
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,649
It's only been seven years 
since I changed a little,

749
00:37:57,649 --> 00:38:01,623
but I still have 
that white collar mentality.

750
00:38:01,923 --> 00:38:06,227
In real life, you 
may never have to eat a lizard,

751
00:38:06,227 --> 00:38:09,531
you may not have to 
be Colorless in your home,

752
00:38:09,531 --> 00:38:11,352
but if you want to stay in this game

753
00:38:11,352 --> 00:38:15,164
and play with this tribe, 
you will have to adapt.

754
00:38:15,164 --> 00:38:18,253
You will have to be more 
Colorless to fit in.

755
00:38:18,253 --> 00:38:20,090
That's all they say, I think.

756
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:23,028
I have no intention 
of changing who you are.

757
00:38:23,028 --> 00:38:25,871
But to play this game, 
you need to be a player.

758
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:28,735
You know, 
I listen to what they say.

759
00:38:28,735 --> 00:38:31,517
It's tough, 
but I take it to heart.

760
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:34,521
And I really think I can 
do what you suggest.

761
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,843
I want to be part 
of the Colorless tribe.

762
00:38:37,929 --> 00:38:39,682
An interesting tip.

763
00:38:39,682 --> 00:38:41,667
A bit cathartic, hopefully 
.

764
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:43,657
It's time to vote.

765
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:45,247
Nina, over to you.

766
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,324
I will count the votes.

767
00:39:20,216 --> 00:39:22,821
If anyone has an 
immunity idol and wants to play it,

768
00:39:22,821 --> 00:39:24,926
now is the time to do it.

769
00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:31,641
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

770
00:39:31,641 --> 00:39:34,495
The eliminated person 
will leave the board immediately.

771
00:39:34,495 --> 00:39:35,923
I will read the votes.

772
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:52,242
Will. 
Two Will votes, one Nina vote.

773
00:39:54,717 --> 00:39:55,780
Nina. 
Equality.

774
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:59,968
Two Nina votes, two Will votes, 
one vote left.

775
00:40:04,049 --> 00:40:05,996
Third person eliminated...

776
00:40:07,116 --> 00:40:09,280
Nina. 
Bring me your torch.

777
00:40:18,962 --> 00:40:20,807
Nina, the tribe has spoken.

778
00:40:25,331 --> 00:40:26,560
It's time to go.

779
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:37,159
Survivor is often 
about taking short-term losses

780
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:39,284
to better win in the long run.

781
00:40:39,284 --> 00:40:40,671
Your loss today

782
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:43,842
implies that no tarp 
will shelter you on the camp

783
00:40:43,842 --> 00:40:45,887
and that you are still 
reduced by one limb.

784
00:40:45,887 --> 00:40:49,178
The hope is that eventually 
it will be worth it.

785
00:40:49,178 --> 00:40:51,687
Take your things, 
return to camp. Good night.

Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

788
00:41:12,348 --> 00:41:14,782
Next time, 
in a special double episode...

789
00:41:14,782 --> 00:41:16,750
- This mentality sucks. 
- It's not... I...

790
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:17,801
Is that 
how your mother raised you?

791
00:41:17,801 --> 00:41:19,035
In every confrontation...

792
00:41:19,035 --> 00:41:22,954
You don't get a face tattoo 
without being seriously bothered.

793
00:41:23,392 --> 00:41:24,646
...there is a little blood.

794
00:41:25,794 --> 00:41:26,757
Go on ! Go on ! Go on !

795
00:41:27,366 --> 00:41:29,529
A huge crash!

796
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:30,338
She's bleeding!

797
00:41:30,338 --> 00:41:32,260
Everyone, stop! 
Doctor !

798
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,255
According to them, I am not as free-spirited 
as they are.

799
00:41:35,255 --> 00:41:36,652
It may be true.

800
00:41:36,652 --> 00:41:41,565
Maybe being out here in 
the wild with complete strangers,

801
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:43,655
brought out 
another from my side.

802
00:41:43,655 --> 00:41:45,977
So I'm going 
to draw resources in me

803
00:41:45,977 --> 00:41:48,522
and maybe change that.

804
00:41:48,522 --> 00:41:52,278
These eight days 
have clearly changed my life.
