- Lex is so politicking for
a win, and that's fine.

175
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,890
But just watching him make
spoons for Tom

176
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,475
and kiss ass to everybody,

177
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:40,603
and talk in his
"dad" voice, annoys me.

178
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,854
- Uber.

179
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,065
- Oh, my gosh.

180
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,775
- It's got a brand name.

181
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,652
- Am I the only one who notices
he's a totally weird person?

182
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,070
It's annoying.

183
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,947
I would like to vote off Lex
in a perfect world.

184
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,574
If I thought there was going
to be no merger, ever,

185
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,617
then I would
do it in a heartbeat.

186
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,411
- You know, I'm stoked enough
about this spoon.

187
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,497
I think I may end up
bringing it home with me.

188
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,790
- That's great.

189
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,793
- Whoo-whoo.

190
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,474
- Yo, yo, everybody wake up.

191
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:18,891
Wake up! Wake up!

192
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,310
Yo, we got mail.

193
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,313
(whistling)
Wake up, we got mail.

194
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,107
It is big and it is nasty.

195
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,316
- Oh, Lord.

196
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,317
- Everybody ready here?

197
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,485
It's an immunity challenge.

198
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:33,531
We got 20 minutes to eat and get
out of here if we want.

199
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,824
- Oh, I'm anxious.

200
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:35,825
- Ready?

201
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,952
- Anxious, yes.

202
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:38,995
- Oh, my.

203
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,496
- What's that?

204
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:41,497
Oh.

205
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,000
- That's weird.

206
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:49,880
Okay. "Raise your hand
if you know how to do it."

207
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:53,009
- "You'll need lots of patience
to make it through it.

208
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,470
The weight on your head
lasts as long as your power."

209
00:09:56,554 --> 00:10:02,476
- "If you let your arm drop,
it may be your last shower."

210
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,436
- That's something nasty.

211
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,479
So we're going to be holding
something up.

212
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,189
- Your last shower
or your last hour?

213
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,691
- Your last shower.

214
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,943
- When we got mail, it was
written in such a way that

215
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,904
some of us thought,
"Is it an individual

216
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:14,905
immunity challenge
or a tribal?"

217
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,866
Your last shower.

218
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:17,867
A team wouldn't
take a shower together.

219
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,870
It'd be more or less
an individual shower.

220
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:21,871
- Based on the clues, what do--
do you think it's a reward?

221
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,040
Do you think it's immunity?
- Immunity.

222
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,750
It'll be your last shower.
- Be your last shower.

223
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,002
- Ohh...
- That's good-bye.

224
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,004
- We could figure out that we
would have to hold something

225
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,006
on our head
for a long period of time.

226
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,883
But we had no idea
what was going on with--

227
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,926
And any, just kind of given up
on guessing anymore.

228
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:48,981
- Morning, guys.

229
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:49,940
- Morning.

230
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,527
- First things first,
as always.

231
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,242
The ten of you have now merged
into one tribe.

232
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,245
- Whoo!

233
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,246
- Congratulations.

234
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,749
- And for the moment,
you are without name.

235
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,917
You'll deal with that later.

236
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,752
I do, however,
have your new colors.

237
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,296
- Clarence.

238
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,465
- My favorite color, green.

239
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:15,424
I like green.

240
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,052
- Now since you guys
are just one tribe,

241
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,762
you obviously only need
one camp to live in.

242
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:23,808
If you had your choice, which
camp would you like to live in?

243
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,434
- Boran.
- Boran.

244
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,061
- Boran sounds good.

245
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,813
When this challenge is over,
you'll head back to Boran.

246
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:32,775
Your personal items from Samburu
will be waiting there for you.

247
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:37,613
Because you are one tribe,
team immunity is gone.

248
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,906
Individual immunity
is what's at stake.

249
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,616
- Oh, a necklace.

250
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,952
- Wear this, you cannot
be voted out at Tribal Council.

251
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,454
Now to today's challenge.

252
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,456
It's going to require a lot
of endurance,

253
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,917
and a strong
threshold of pain.

254
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,918
You're gonna step up on a log.

255
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,337
One arm will be raised.

256
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,257
That arm is connected to a rope,
which is connected to a bucket,

257
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,258
which is full of water.

258
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,843
The slightest movement brings
the bucket over,

259
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,637
you're out
of the challenge.

260
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,098
Last person standing
wins immunity.

261
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,143
Pick a spot, let's do it.

262
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,144
Survivors ready?

263
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,895
And begin.

264
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,835
- Feeling anything, Kim?

265
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,378
Back starting to get to you
a little?

266
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,504
- Little bit.
- Little bit?

267
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,797
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

268
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:37,840
Well, we're 10 minutes in,

269
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,216
so I figure it'll go
several hours.

270
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:39,884
How about you?
- I love doing this.

271
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,011
I do this at home.

272
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,345
- So you like that little
tingly sort of thing?

273
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,638
- Mmm, it's great.
- Starts going numb?

274
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:45,848
- You don't get this enough
in life, I find.

275
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,057
- Well, good, all right.

276
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,726
I'll see you guys
in a little bit.

277
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,281
- Agh!

278
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:02,907
- Kelly, benches.

279
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,951
You can sit and relax.

280
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,413
- (gasps)

281
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,714
- Can you see any buckets
wavering at all?

282
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:19,715
- None.

283
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,342
The buckets are solid.

284
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,093
(whispering)
So how were things over there?

285
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,553
- You know, they gave us
a lot of information,

286
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,763
like when you--
- Obviously.

287
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:26,764
I couldn't believe that.

288
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,682
- No, I know, but we did
by far the right thing.

289
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:29,683
- Mm-hmm.

290
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:30,935
No, I'm glad he's gone.

291
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:31,936
I'm ecstatic.

292
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,562
I was so happy.

293
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,731
Frank kind of seems like
a jackass, but the kids on here

294
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,316
really don't want Frank
on the jury.

295
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,777
Frank hates women and doesn't
want a woman to win, by the way.

296
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,069
So I don't think we want him
on the jury.

297
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:44,532
- Okay.

298
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,368
- Oh, screw it.

299
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:50,621
Whoo!
- How's that feel, B?

300
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,249
- Oh! Well, I can't feel one
whole side of my body,

301
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,876
but that's cool.

302
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,126
- (gasps)

303
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,426
- Oh!

304
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,136
- (groans)
- All right, Big T.

305
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,054
- Good job, Big Tom!

306
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,139
- All right, way to go.

307
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,434
- Look at Frank looking at his.
- Come on, Frank.

308
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,562
- I can't believe his bucket
isn't that more sensitive.

309
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,188
- Come on, Frank.
Dummy.

310
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,108
- Frank and Ethan, their arms
seem to be really tired.

311
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,777
And, like, Frank's just
moving all over the place.

312
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,113
And here it goes.

313
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,283
Yeah. Oh, good job, Frank.

314
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,284
- Good job, Frank.

315
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:28,993
- Good job!
Way to tough it out.

316
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,593
- Ethan's starting to hurt.

317
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,136
He's showing pain too bad.

318
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,138
- Clarence is close.
He's close.

00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:54,435
♪ The sun'll come out

320
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:59,189

00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,126
- All right, T-bird.

329
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,379
- So talented.

330
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,224
- Well, guys, it
wouldn't be<i> Survivor</i> without...

331
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,352
- Oh, no, hell no.
Come on, man.

332
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,896
- ... a little temptation.
- (chuckling)

333
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,065
- Fresh off the grill,
all-American cheeseburger.

334
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:46,195
It's got onion, mayonnaise,
tomato, mustard, ketchup,

335
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,698
lettuce, cheese,
and a lot of beef.

336
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,033
- Oh, my God.

337
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:51,450
- Somebody's gone.

338
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,201
- Ethan's gone.

339
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:56,163
- Teresa.
- No, no, Lex. Lex.

340
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,665
- It's a pretty simple deal.

341
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,834
If immunity is not that
important, you feel safe,

342
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,544
come on down,
have yourself a meal.

343
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,587
- Look at them all looking.

344
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,922
- (laughing) Oh.

345
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,048
- Take it, Lex.

346
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,049
- This will appeal to Clarence.

347
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,050
- I don't blame her.

348
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,551
- Clarence?

349
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,887
That'll remind you of home,
come on, come on.

350
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:12,930
That's a burger.

351
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,139
- Bring it over here,
let me test it!

352
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,308
(laughter)

353
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,394
- Don't do it, Clarence.
Hang tough!

354
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,188
- Nobody interested?
- We're interested.

355
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,399
- All right, well, I'll just
give it to these guys, then.

356
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,401
(all cheering)

357
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,403
- You're welcome.

358
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,071
- Uh-uh-uh-uh.

359
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,073
- Oh, my God!

360
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,533
- Hey, Tom...

361
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,534
- Oh, my God!

362
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,911
- Hey, you guys eat quietly!
- Okay.

363
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:36,578
- Sorry, we're very sorry.

364
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,581
- It's a little bit cold.

365
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,504
- That was so good.

366
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:52,052
(crickets chirping)

367
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,766
- Would you go for
a whole pizza?

368
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,892
- Yeah.

369
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,060
- You would?
No, you wouldn't.

370
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,270
- 100%, guarantee you.

371
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,271
- No way.

372
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,023
- Guarantee you.

373
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,944
- Next on the menu.

374
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,488
It's got a crust.

375
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,323
It's got cheese.

376
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,117
It's cut into four slices.

377
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,244
And it is very hot.

378
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,287
Look at that.

379
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,831
Mmm. Mmm.

380
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,625
Tell me this
is tempting somebody.

381
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,835
- Ooh.

382
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:25,919
- If Clarence lets go
and takes that pizza

383
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,337
and sits here and
eats the whole thing himself,

384
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,840
which he would,
I'll kill him myself.

385
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:30,841
- Which he would.

386
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:33,969
- I'll kill him myself.

387
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:34,970
- Clarence?

388
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:35,971
Get out of here?

389
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:36,972
- Peace.

390
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:37,306
- Peace out!
All right.

391
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,141
- Whoo!

392
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,393
- Oh, my God.

393
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,481
- You guys, it's not even
finished cooking yet.

394
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,648
You're lucky.

395
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,151
It's all doughy.

396
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,659
(all groan)

397
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,660
- Good job, Lex.

398
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,121
Really good job.

399
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:04,041
- Lex, you missed out
on all that food by minutes.

400
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,293
- Don't remind me.

401
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,212
- I'd actually like to see it
come down to Ethan and Clarence

402
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,838
and see what happens.

403
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,049
- I don't want to see Clarence
wearing that damn necklace.

404
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:15,594
That's just gonna piss me off.
- Oh, I know.

405
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,766
- No!

406
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,309
- Ohh, Ethan.

407
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:26,271
Good job.
You did a great job.

408
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:34,112
(crickets chirping)

409
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,203
- (whistles)
Let's compromise.

410
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,579
Rock, paper, scissors.

411
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,455
- Clarence, I have
too much to lose.

412
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,333
There's too many of you here.

413
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,668
- I don't think it'll be you.

414
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,669
- Huh?

415
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,379
- It won't be you.

416
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,216
- Guys...

417
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:59,012
That's chicken, salad, corn
on the cob, rice, cold beer,

418
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:02,558
Mountain Dew, big glass of ice.

419
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,559
Same deal as last time.

420
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,269
Step down, it's yours.

421
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,563
- Don't get bribed down.

422
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,605
- Close your eyes, y'all.

423
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,732
- Don't look at it.

424
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,361
- You're stronger than me.

425
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:18,323
You can win more immunity
challenges than me.

426
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:22,452
- (sighs)
They want me gone, too,

427
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:26,540
because I'm strong.

428
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,792
- You made that up.

429
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:32,713
You're trying to trick me,
and I don't like it.

430
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:33,463
- He's working hard up there.

431
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,464
You see him?

432
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,885
He's trying to make a deal.

433
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,761
- Hey, there's also strength
in alliances.

434
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,888
- What?

435
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:44,224
- There's also strength
in alliances.

436
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,435
I'm not Silas.
You've got to trust me.

437
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,978
- Do you trust me?

438
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:48,437
- Do you trust me?

439
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,691
(crow cawing)

440
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,990
- Clarence is starting
to break down.

441
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,826
I think he's trying to bait her
down, either by offering her

442
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,286
a deal that, you know,

443
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,954
people are
not going to vote her off.

444
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,456
He keeps looking over to us,
asking us for some kind of

445
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,750
assurance that we won't.

446
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,419
I don't know why he's
asking us for anything, though.

447
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:15,797
You know, when you're up there,
it's just about you.

448
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:25,140
- They can't even tell what I'm
talking about.

449
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,321
T... T...

450
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,490
Rock, paper, scissors.

451
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,205
(crickets chirping)

452
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,002
- Oh, there it is.

453
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,295
- Paper covers rock.

454
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,469
- Whoo!

455
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,470
- Yeah!

456
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,389
(all cheering)

457
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:08,308
(Probst)
Six hours, 20 seconds.

458
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,143
Clarence gets the food.

459
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,312
You, my dear, get this.

460
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,605
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

461
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,693
Big day for you guys.

462
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,653
Two tribes became one.

463
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,363
Tonight you'll have a new name,
and tomorrow night,

464
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:25,742
Tribal Council, where only one
of you is absolutely safe.

465
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:26,535
You guys can
head back to camp.

466
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,954
I'll see you tomorrow.

467
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,423
- Somebody else better
lead the way.

468
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,717
- Welcome home,
guys, welcome home.

469
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,884
- Thank you.

470
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,345
Show me which mountain we
climbed, the three of us.

471
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,972
- Right there.
- That's it, the big one.

472
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:47,889
See the ridge we climbed?

473
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,474
- I just shifted my weight
just slightly,

474
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,560
water sloshed,
and it was down.

475
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,520
'Cause I still
felt so strong.

476
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:56,064
- I didn't want the sandwich,
I couldn't eat.

477
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,692
- Why?
- Well...

478
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,903
- The whole tribe was together
for the first time and able

479
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,073
to talk and imagine
getting in the mail

480
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,744
an invitation to attend
a Wagner family reunion,

481
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,580
and your last name is Smith.

482
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,498
That's just what it felt like.

483
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,584
I'm just floating on the outside
kind of right now,

484
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,879
looking at things.

485
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,715
(overlapping chatter)
- Make it shorter.

486
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:24,009
- Oh, my gosh,
they brought the cart!

487
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,053
- Nice.

488
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,054
Oh, it feels like home.

489
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,889
- Welcome, you guys.
Welcome.

490
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,266
- Oh, my gosh, you guys,
we got some stuff!

491
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,267
- Oh, gosh.

492
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,560
- This is really exciting.

493
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:34,811
We have a little note.

494
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,438
Come on!
- Hey, Big Tom.

495
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,606
- Whoa!
- Come on!

496
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,066
- Okay.
- Okay.

497
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,484
- "You're now all together,
as you may have expected.

498
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,737
"You've got one more day
till someone's ejected.

499
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,114
"Make a new flag.
Decide on a name.

500
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,075
"One that you'll keep
for the rest of the game.

501
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,659
"Reach into the basket
to give your spirits a lift

502
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,454
with this
housewarming gift."

503
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,623
- Whoo!

504
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,583
(all screaming excitedly)

505
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,173
- Oh, my God!

506
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,967
- We have to eat this soon,
though, 'cause this will go bad.

507
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,136
- Wow.
- You know, let's celebrate.

508
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,429
Let's celebrate with this.

509
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,597
- Yay!

510
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,641
- I haven't eaten in 24 hours.
I'm so hungry.

511
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,142
- Oh, Lex.

512
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,644
- This is so great,
this is awesome.

513
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,646
- Come get prime real estate.
- Pick a spot.

514
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,189
Any old spot will do.

515
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,191
We'll pass the jug of wine
around.

516
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:24,444
We have reason to celebrate.

517
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:25,570
- Everybody was happy.

518
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,323
Everybody was ready
to partake in the feast.

519
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:30,992
Well, you can only have so many
preparers for that.

520
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,619
We were all standing around and
I just didn't want to stand

521
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,830
around, you know,
I just...

522
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:35,956
So I just went outside
the manyata

523
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:39,209
and started gathering wood,
because we need wood.

524
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,252
- How's it taste?

525
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:41,628
- Mm-hmm.

526
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:42,629
Tastes great.

527
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:43,797
- T-Bird.

528
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,840
You earned that, baby.

529
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,341
You earned that.
- Sure did.

530
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:47,342
- I know.

531
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:48,802
(laughter)

532
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:51,847
(indistinct chatter)

533
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,723
- I'm sorry, man.

534
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:54,850
I'm sorry.

535
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:55,851
- All right.

536
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,686
- Come on, Frank.

537
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,356
Frank is a very big loner.

538
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:04,359
He socially seems so inept.

539
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:06,236
I mean, I guess probably a large
section of the population

540
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,738
is introverted and antisocial,
and that's fine,

541
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,407
but I feel like there are
prescription drugs

542
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,325
to counteract that,
and he should maybe be on them.

543
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,287
(laughter and chatter)

544
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,209
- Here's to my new
ten friends.

545
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,335
- Aww.

546
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,672
- That I'm excited to spend
the next adventure with.

547
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,382
- Nice.
- Yay.

548
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:30,010
- You could almost tell Teresa
is a good woman.

549
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,554
It's hard not to see just an old
Georgia Baptist

550
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:33,847
good ol' girl in there.

551
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,516
And, uh, she sure ain't bad
to look at.

552
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,352
(whistles)
My wife knows I'm just a man.

553
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:42,564
Hell, I'm out here in the bush,
and after looking at Brandon

554
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,483
for seven days,
I don't care if Teresa

555
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,403
had one eye on her forehead,
I'd still take her.

556
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:49,321
(howls)

557
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:52,157
- You were doing it
right next to me!

558
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,450
- Leave it to that pervert.

559
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,492
I didn't do it.

560
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:57,746
(laughter)

561
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,080
- Yes, ma'am.

562
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,082
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

563
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,125
- So let's think up
a drinking game.

564
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,628
- Something you have to--
like truth or dare.

565
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,087
- I think we should tell
something very personal

566
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:06,963
about ourselves so that
we get to know each other.

567
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,965
'Cause we don't really
know each other.

568
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,551
- It's like, "I never."
- "I never."

569
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,553
- We played this game, um,
"I never,"

570
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,679
which is, like, you're
supposed to, like,

571
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,640
tell dirty stories
and whatever.

572
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:20,769
- I've never walked
in a crowd naked.

573
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:21,937
- Does thongs count?

574
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,231
- I was about to ask about
underwear.

575
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,733
- I have been turned on
by a 56-year-old woman.

576
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,777
- Ohh!
- Whoo!

577
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,946
- How naughty.

578
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,947
(raucous laughter)

579
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,574
- Come on.
- So all those--

580
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:35,784
- I've never had sex
in an airplane.

581
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:36,785
- I have.

582
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,622
(all exclaim)

583
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,457
- Tom...
- Uh-oh, look out.

584
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,709
- Tom's ready to change
his sleeping arrangement.

585
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,170
- I'm supposed to say
something I've never done?

586
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,297
- Right.
- And it's the truth.

587
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,924
- Right, the truth.

588
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:51,925
You've literally
never done it.

589
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:54,803
- I've never broken the honor
of a handshake.

590
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,805
It's just a golden rule
I was brought up on.

591
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,640
- No, I like it.

592
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,849
I'm very respectful of that.
That's great.

593
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,310
- Even I enjoyed it,
it was good just to relax

594
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:02,686
for a little bit.

595
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,771
It was fun.

596
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,606
But I wanted to get it over
with, though, too.

597
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,650
Well, it's still daylight.
We got time to go get wood.

598
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,485
- Let's get wood.
- Let's get wood.

599
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:11,319
- I needed a little booze
in my system.

600
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,946
- I might even
start break-dancing.

601
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:15,490
- This is nice.

602
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,494
- Take out the dead arm.

603
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:19,869
- (laughs)

604
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:24,541
♪ ♪

605
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:41,516
- Look at the elephant.
- Behind you.

606
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,562
- Frank!
See the elephant?

607
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,104
- He's coming this way.

608
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:49,065
Give this guy room.

609
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,526
He knows he's got plenty of room
to the right if he wants,

610
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:52,694
he wants to just...

611
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:53,695
There he goes.

612
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,823
He's going to turn.

613
00:26:56,906 --> 00:27:01,202
He's taking a second guess.

614
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,873
Taking a little dump, looking
around.

615
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:09,878
I'm downwind from him, so he
doesn't have a good smell.

616
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,840
He's stepping to the right.

617
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:17,010
He just...

618
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,730
- There was a big bull elephant
right next to our camp.

619
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:33,735
Frank, he was making an elephant
motion and I don't know...

620
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,403
(imitates elephant)

621
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,905
I really don't know
what he was doing,

622
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:40,408
but he was messing
with that elephant.

623
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,410
- I'm just imitating him,
that's all.

624
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,953
Just seeing if he relaxes.

625
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:47,540
I'm sure by an elephant's
eyesight, he's not exactly sure

626
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:48,792
what I am.

627
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,586
So maybe
whatever visual he has,

628
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:57,884
he just sees a gentle
tail sway, a loping.

629
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:12,232
The elephant just seemed to be
swaying and wagging his tail and

630
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,775
looking over, and...

631
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,569
I just wanted to experiment
a little animal behavior

632
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:17,946
and just hang out there
with him and just

633
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,989
sway back and forth
and swinging my canteen

634
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:23,284
behind me like a tail.

635
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,578
I don't know, at times it seemed
like he might have acknowledged,

636
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:28,581
stopped and looked over,
you know?

637
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,459
There's a few humans here
I wouldn't interact with.

638
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,962
You know,
but the animals, yes.

639
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:43,972
(indistinct chatter)

640
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:47,183
- We should have
a tribe name ceremony.

641
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,227
- We ought to come up with our
own name.

642
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,187
- With our own name.
- Now that we're a family.

643
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,480
- Does anybody
have strong preferences

644
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,982
one way or the other?

645
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,984
- Maji is water,
Moto is fire.

646
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,944
Maji Moto means hot water.

647
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,280
- Maji Moto?
I like it.

648
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,281
- And we're always
in hot water.

649
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,575
I mean, there's
a double meaning there.

650
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:04,826
- We're kind of brainstorming
about the name together,

651
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,454
and somebody came up
with the idea

652
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:12,125
of getting the Swahili
definition for water and fire.

653
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,043
And so what we came up
with it's Moto Maji

654
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,462
or something along
those lines.

655
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:16,838
(overlapping chatter)

656
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:17,839
- Maji.

657
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:18,840
- Maji Moto?

658
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,258
- M-O-T-O?

659
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,134
- I like it.

660
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:24,345
I think it's something
like Moto Java

661
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,388
or something like that.

662
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,682
- I like Maji Moto.

663
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:28,683
- I love it.

664
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:30,185
- It's Moto Maji.

665
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:30,894
Moto Magi?

666
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:33,730
Momo Magi?
I don't know.

667
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:34,522
- Moto Maji?

668
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,524
- Moto Maji.
- That sounds good.

669
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,692
- I really don't care
about the name.

670
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:39,027
I think that's all
kind of cornball anyway.

671
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,529
I don't give a (blip) one way
or the other, didn't care.

672
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,990
They could have named it,
you know, Theaters Anonymous,

673
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:44,991
I could care less.

674
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,202
- A show of hands?

675
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,204
First motion?
Second, anyone?

676
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,039
Maji Moto?
- Maji Moto.

677
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:54,292
- Moto Maji.
- Moto Maji.

678
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:13,228
- 21 days, can you guys
believe it?

679
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,896
- This is a game.

680
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,064
But it's so much more
than a game.

681
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:19,901
I mean, we are thrust
into a survival situation

682
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,402
in a strange place.

683
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:25,949
We're pulling together,
creating a society.

684
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:29,077
At this point,
we're down to ten people.

685
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,163
We have a lot invested here.

686
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:35,625
- I don't care who you are,
$1 million changes your life.

687
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,044
So the fact of the matter is
is that you have to be

688
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,922
very aware now
of who you say what to,

689
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,550
what you say, what comments you
make about other people,

690
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,718
because these people
are going to be on a jury,

691
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:46,970
and they may discuss you
amongst themselves.

692
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,138
And so now you have to be
very careful.

693
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:52,559
- Brandon,
you're unusually quiet.

694
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:55,103
- I know. I'm...

695
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,105
I can listen better
whenever I don't talk.

696
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,107
- Okay.

697
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:05,071
- I have noticed whispering
and conversations taking place,

698
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:06,698
whether they be
the case that,

699
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,950
"Hey, let's bring Frank
along for the ride,"

700
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,744
or, "I think we'd better
get rid of Frank,"

701
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,454
I have no idea.

702
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,290
- What are we going to do?

703
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,291
- About what?

704
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,793
- The hatchet.

705
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:19,794
- About what?

706
00:31:19,877 --> 00:31:20,795
- The hatchet.

707
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:21,796
The knife in the back.

708
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:23,089
Who are we going to slice?

709
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,184
- The tribe Moto Maji
is up and running,

710
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,478
and it starts with our flag,

711
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,646
so I've got a big job
ahead of me.

712
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,064
So... I've got
to make sure I finish it.

713
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,613
- Talk to you about the, um...
- Yeah.

714
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,323
- About tonight.
- Mm-hmm.

715
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,491
- I don't know how you feel
about this, but I may just

716
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,953
tell him straight up
what we're doing.

717
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,955
- Well, I don't know,
what are we doing?

718
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,207
- Well, I thought we were...
- What I did--

719
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,502
- The one person that's going
to be voted off at this point,

720
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,003
I don't think has a clue
about it.

721
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,964
(indistinct chatter)

722
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,383
- I got to get
one of them water jugs.

723
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,844
- So I've decided,
I've taken it on myself,

724
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:11,137
that I'll pull him aside
and tell him

725
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,181
exactly what
we're going to do.

726
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,182
I know he's not gonna like it.

727
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,601
I don't know how
he's going to react.

728
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,398
- Today Lex came up
with this scheme.

729
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,817
Lex, the grandmaster, Lex, that
for some reason people bow to.

730
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:25,693
I don't understand why.

731
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,820
- You and I have gotten close.
- Yeah.

732
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,698
- In this whole situation,
you're a man, I'm a man.

733
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,075
And I can only
deal with you man to man.

734
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,035
- I know.

735
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,453
- I didn't want to lie to you
about anything.

736
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,371
- Yeah, that's cool.
- And I wanted to tell you,

737
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:41,042
just face to face,
that we've all decided

738
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,044
to vote you off today,
and...

739
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,253
and I want you to understand.

740
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:48,049
I mean, it sounds, it sounds
cliche, but it's not personal.

741
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,050
- I know.

742
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,218
- And it's all about the game.

743
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,053
It's all about competition.

744
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,722
Now that we're realizing
that individual immunity

745
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,308
is like everything...
- Yeah.

746
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,268
- ... we can't have you
winning all those things.

747
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,103
I think that you stand
a good chance

748
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,397
of winning
the lion's share.

749
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,065
It's just--
it doesn't work.

750
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,400
I just wanted to be straight
with you.

751
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,401
'Cause I can't--
- I know.

752
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,902
- I can't play that lying game.

753
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:08,778
- You're a good guy.

754
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,905
- Oh, and as if that's
more ethical?

755
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:13,408
Because Lex is like, "Well, I
can't bold-faced lie to him."

756
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,410
Okay, you can just lie to him
all day when it's...

757
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,412
when it would be inconvenient
to tell him the truth.

758
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,622
But then at the last possible
moment, you'll slip in the truth

759
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,708
and that's going to make you
an ethical person?

760
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:22,875
Okay.

761
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,127
- All right.
- Thanks, man.

762
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,254
- I like Clarence.
The kid has really grown on me.

763
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,005
I mean, he sensed
that people were getting

764
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,591
rubbed the wrong way by him,
and he changed his ways.

765
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,593
I like him.
I think he's friendly.

766
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,928
I think he's funny.

767
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:39,809
He's part of the group,
unlike crazy, outcast Frank.

768
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,144
- I'm not holding anybody.
We have our group and that's it.

769
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,270
- Right.

770
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,397
- Everything else,
the bets are off.

771
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,398
- Right.

772
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:46,858
I don't like being told
what to do.

773
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,234
I don't know at this point that
Lex is playing both ends

774
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,111
against the middle,
but I'm a little bit guarded

775
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,155
with all that.

776
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,157
- At least do me this,
man, all right?

777
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,785
When you talk to everybody,
tell them to keep us together.

778
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,495
There's six of us
and four of them.

779
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,788
- So what?

780
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,040
- I'm like you, we ought to go
to the wire.

781
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,333
You know, I'm with you.

782
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,419
- I don't want to be voted off
when Brandon's still around

783
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:07,462
and Kim's still around.

784
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,463
- I know.

785
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,297
Well, I'll be honest with you.

786
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,258
I'm ashamed
to vote anybody off

787
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:16,971
besides Brandon
at this next venture.

788
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:19,307
- And that's 'cause
it's loyalty, man.

789
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,143
- I won't vote for Clarence
tonight because I told him

790
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,979
I wouldn't do that,
and he honored his word,

791
00:34:25,062 --> 00:34:26,689
and I feel like I've
got to do the same.

792
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:29,484
♪ ♪

793
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,471
- Well, congratulations
to all you guys for surviving

794
00:34:58,554 --> 00:34:59,555
long enough to make the merge.

795
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,642
Survive tonight's vote, you make
it to the next phase

796
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:05,394
of this game,
which is the jury.

797
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:08,397
The only person we know who
is assured that spot

798
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,192
is Teresa
after winning immunity.

799
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,235
Big day yesterday.

800
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,695
Lot of changes,
including a new name.

801
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,197
Tell me about the name, Lex.

802
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,699
- Uh, the name is Moto Maji,

803
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,369
which is Swahili
for fire and water,

804
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,705
which are two very, very
important things, pretty much

805
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,457
the essential ingredients
of life out here.

806
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,709
- Ethan, a whole new
tribe now.

807
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:32,672
What was the first day and the
first night like getting along?

808
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,215
- It actually
went pretty well.

809
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,466
Everyone's getting along great
and we're joking and it's--

810
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,386
it's a good old--
big old happy family.

811
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,013
- Brandon, did last night's
celebration

812
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,683
change your
opinion of anybody?

813
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,434
Either stuff you'd heard
or stuff you'd seen yourself

814
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,853
and thought yourself?

815
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,855
- Frank, I have known
since the beginning.

816
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,190
I've never known him
to smile or crack a joke.

817
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,400
And last night he actually
cracked a couple of jokes.

818
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:55,278
I almost hit the floor
with a stroke.

819
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:59,365
So I guess that changed, I mean,
I saw a softer, more human--

820
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:02,785
humane side of Frank last night
that I'd never seen before,

821
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,245
which was very nice.

822
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:07,206
- Tom, the game
is still going on.

823
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,250
Is that in the back of your mind
all the time?

824
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,919
- It don't let up--
it's unforgiving.

825
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,380
You have a little high,
but you-- it don't last long.

826
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:18,634
Like our little party
last night was great,

827
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,929
but just as soon as the cheese
was gone, reality sets in.

828
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,431
It's back to the whole push
and grind and, uh,

829
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:26,434
you got to go
right back to looking around.

830
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:29,562
And if it's not the animals,
it's the people in the game.

831
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,981
- Well, for two of you
guys, Teresa and Clarence,

832
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,275
the immunity challenge
obviously had

833
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,736
completely different
stakes than for anyone else.

834
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:40,281
It had to be about immunity
and feeling like you needed it.

835
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,407
Is that true, Teresa,
for you?

836
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,952
- Well, there are no
certainties in this game at all,

837
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,539
as we've seen each day or as
we go along how things change.

838
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:51,334
So I thought it'd be nice to
know for sure that,

839
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,586
going to Tribal Council,

840
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,129
that I might have
a little security

841
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:56,756
just for a short period
of time.

842
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:57,924
- How about for you,
Clarence?

843
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,759
Immunity
the overriding factor?

844
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:04,430
- I spent most of my time up
there battling between hoping

845
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,974
that there was a lot of loyalty
left with old Boran,

846
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,477
and struggling between
maybe I needed this immunity.

847
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,478
So it was tough.

848
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,688
- So what made you quit?

849
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,440
- I could tell she was in a
great amount of pain, but I knew

850
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:17,443
that she wasn't going to quit,
and so the only thing

851
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:21,322
I could think that was fair
and respectful to us both

852
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,491
as competitors was rock,
paper, scissors.

853
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,326
I went rock, she went paper.

854
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,495
And I'm a man of my word.

855
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,456
And seeing that lady,
mom of two in her 40s,

856
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:33,668
hold her arm up when
everybody else was down

857
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:37,672
going up against me,
an athlete in my early 20s,

858
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:41,550
and having that
will to not come down,

859
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,010
it just blew me away.

860
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,513
I'll remember it
for the rest of my life.

861
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,348
- Is it fair to say, Ethan,
that the game does change

862
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:51,018
at this point in terms of what
you reveal to others

863
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,228
and who you can trust?

864
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,354
- It definitely changes.

865
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,689
Depending how you're
playing the game,

866
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,856
it's important to yourself
that you feel good

867
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,150
about what you say
and you feel good

868
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,486
about how you say it
and how you present yourself.

869
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:03,072
I have a tough time looking
someone in the eye and saying,

870
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:06,033
"You know, I love you,
you're my best friend,"

871
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:06,909
and then, you know,

872
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,536
going and voting
against them, you know?

873
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,371
I like truth.

874
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,539
- It's time to vote.

875
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,208
Ethan, you're up.

876
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,744
- I know you explained things
to me, man to man,

877
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,328
and I respect that.

878
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,247
I've just got to make sure that
I make things a little hard

879
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:56,167
on you on your way
to winning this thing.

880
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:07,053
- You are a really,
really nice guy.

881
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,512
I don't want to vote
for anybody, actually.

882
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:12,141
But, um, I wish you
lots of luck in life.

883
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,276
- Clarence, when you came
to this game,

884
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:24,028
you made some huge mistakes

885
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,780
and had a pretty rough
start.

886
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,948
But you've come
a long way, my friend.

887
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,077
And it's been really good
getting to know you.

888
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,953
But I am here to win the game.

889
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:33,954
To go all the way.

890
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:34,622
And you're too big a threat now.

891
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,749
So, you got to go.

892
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,250
Sorry, brother.

893
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,204
- This was a hard vote
for me to cast.

894
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,705
I think you're a wonderful,
fascinating person.

895
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,707
But your leadership,
strength, and skills

896
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,501
make me a little
nervous for down the road,

897
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,879
so I'm giving you
my vote.

898
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,052
- I'll go tally the votes.

899
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,318
Once the votes have been read,
the decision is final.

900
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,486
The person will be
asked to leave

901
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,196
the Tribal Council area
immediately.

902
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,447
I'll read the votes.

903
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:57,079
First vote, Clarence.

904
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,377
Lex.

905
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,464
Clarence.

906
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,720
Lex-- that's two votes Lex,
two votes Clarence.

907
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,516
Clarence.

908
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,147
That's four votes Clarence,
two votes Lex.

909
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,943
Clarence.

910
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:31,489
Clarence.

911
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:32,740
That's enough votes, Clarence.

912
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,783
You need to bring me
your torch.

913
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,006
Clarence, the tribe has spoken.

914
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,888
It's time for you to go.
Take care.

915
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,111
- All right.

916
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,404
No matter how well you do
in this game, you will have

917
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:15,824
an impact on it, as you are now
guaranteed a spot in our jury.

918
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:19,536
You guys can head
back to camp.

919
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,872
(theme song playing)

920
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,678
(Probst)
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

921
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,597
(Probst)
Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>

922
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:42,309
the tribe competes for an
unusual reward.

923
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,813
Lex embarks on a witch hunt to
find out who voted against him.

924
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,440
- I need to smoke that person
out in the next three days

925
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:49,525
and cut their heads off.

926
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:52,528
(Probst)
And the ex-Samburu
members concoct a plan.

927
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:54,154
- If we're going to make
a move, it has to be

928
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,156
this Tribal Council--
it has to be.

929
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,789
- Well, you guys won fair
and square, and I'm glad

930
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:06,000
that I didn't do anything
at any time

931
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,544
to dishonor myself
from my mother.

932
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:10,838
You know, I played
a fair game and I lost.

933
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,923
And I lost because I was strong
and I don't think there are

934
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,676
many people who can say they
lost because they were strong.

935
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,137
And I lost with integrity.

936
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,471
I would have won
with integrity,

937
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,348
and I'm glad I got this
opportunity.
