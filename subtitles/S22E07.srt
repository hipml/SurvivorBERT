1
00:00:01,543 --> 00:00:03,628
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR":

2
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:05,088
THIRD PERSON VOTED OUT OF
"SURVIVOR: REDEMPTION

3
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:09,092
ISLAND," RUSSELL.

4
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:12,137
FOR THE ZAPATERA TRIBE THE ONE
NIGHT OF PLEASURE THEY GOT FROM

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,722
THROWING A CHALLENGE TO GET RID

6
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:16,599
OF RUSSELL TURNED INTO DAYS OF
MISERY.

7
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,101
TRIBE UNITY CRUMBLED.

8
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,520
>> DAVID UNDER PRESSURE IS
REALLY STRESSFUL.

9
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:21,604
>> I DON'T FREAK OUT.

10
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,399
>> Jeff: AND DAVID'S
RELATIONSHIP WITH SARITA GOT SO

11
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:25,233
BAD HE JOINED FORCES WITH

12
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:27,110
STEPHANIE TO TRY TO VOTE SARITA
OUT.

13
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:30,280
>> STEPHANIE IS A CAPABLE
COMPETITOR IN THE CHALLENGES AND

14
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:35,118
I THINK UNQUESTIONABLY SARITA IS
THE WEAKEST PLAYER ON THE TRIBE.

15
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,455
>> Jeff: AT OMETEPE, ROB HAD A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL IN HIS

16
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,957
POCKET ALONG WITH MOST OF HIS
TRIBE.

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,127
>> BY ME HAVING THIS I KNOW THAT
NOBODY ELSE HAS THIS.

18
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,046
>> Jeff: BUT PHILLIP HAD A
LOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP WITH ROB.

19
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,259
>> I HAVE BEEN IN AN ALLIANCE
WITH ROB, GRANT, AND MYSELF.

20
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:54,304
>> Jeff: WHEN ROB TRIED TO
HIDE A CLUE TO

21
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,305
A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL
>> I SAW IT.

22
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,974
>> Jeff: IT WAS ALL-OUT WAR.

23
00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:00,643
>> I'M GOING TO KICK A LITTLE
ASS AROUND HERE.

24
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,270
>> Jeff: NATALIE GOES SHORT!

25
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,814
OMETEPE WINS IMMUNITY!

26
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:09,152
THE OMETEPES WON THEIR THIRD OUT
OF THE LAST FOUR CHALLENGES.

27
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,655
THE ZAPATERAS WENT TO TRIBAL
COUNCIL WHERE DAVE AND STEPHANIE

28
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,367
VOTED FOR SARITA BUT EVERYONE
ELSE VOTED FOR STEPHANIE.

29
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:20,163
STEPHANIE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

30
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:23,416
WITH STEPHANIE OFF TO A DUEL,
BOTH TRIBES ARE NOW EVEN AT SIX.

31
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,711
WELL, YOU MADE THE DECISION TO
GO WITH SOMEBODY YOU THINK YOU

32
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,339
CAN TRUST VERSUS KEEPING
SOMEBODY WHO MIGHT HAVE DONE

33
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,840
BETTER AT CHALLENGES.

34
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,384
WE'LL KNOW SOON ENOUGH IF YOU
MADE THE RIGHT CALL.

35
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,861
>> I HOPE WE CAN ALL COME
TOGETHER.

36
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,781
>> I KNOW DAVID AND SARITA HAVE
HAD SOME DIFFERENCES, BUT I HOPE

37
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,783
YOU GUYS CAN...

38
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,836
>> THE TWO VOTES AGAINST SARITA
WERE STEPHANIE AND MINE.

39
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,337
I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE ANY BONES
ABOUT WHERE I STOOD.

40
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,508
I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO AND I
WANTED TO MAKE MY PLACE AND MY

41
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:18,888
POSITION KNOWN, AND IF IT'S THE
END OF ME, THEN SO BE IT.

42
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,892
>> I LOOK FORWARD TO MOVING
FORWARD, AND ALL PITCHING IN

43
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,352
LIKE WE'RE ALL DOING AROUND
CAMP.

44
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,271
>> ME, TOO, ME, TOO.
AND I DO LOVE CONSTRUCTIVE

45
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,564
FEEDBACK AND I DO NEED TO BUCK
UP MORE.

46
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:32,569
TRIBAL IS NEVER GOOD BUT TONIGHT
WAS ESPECIALLY BAD BECAUSE COME

47
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,488
TO FIND OUT OUR GANG OF SIX DID
HAVE A MAJOR HOLE IN IT, WHICH

48
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:39,284
AS I HAD SUSPECTED, DAVID HAD

49
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:43,079
GONE OVER TO THE DARK SIDE, TO
STEPHANIE.

50
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:46,708
>> WELL, LET'S DO THE BEST WE
CAN TO FUNCTION AS A TRIBE

51
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,586
BECAUSE IT'S IN ALL OUR
COLLECTIVE BEST INTERESTS.

52
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,588
>> I AGREE.

53
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,883
>> THIS IS THE SIX WE'VE WANTED
BACK IN DAY ONE, BUT THERE'S A

54
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,677
BIG RIFT BETWEEN DAVID AND
SARITA.

55
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,262
>> FIND COMMON GROUND LIKE

56
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,263
WE DID BACK IN DAY TWO AND
THREE.

57
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,431
>> I AGREE.

58
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,392
AND I HAVE A TON OF RESPECT FOR
YOU, DAVID.

59
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:07,353
>> YOU DON'T NEED TO GIVE ME A
SPEECH. IT DOESN'T MATTER.

60
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:11,482
>> DAVE IS SHOWING HE CAN BE A
BIT OF AN ANTAGONIST BUT

61
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:17,155
HOPEFULLY DAVID CAN BE MAN
ENOUGH AND PUT HIS EGO AND PRIDE

62
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:20,950
AND EMOTIONS ASIDE AND, YOU
KNOW, FOR THE BIGGER CAUSE OF

63
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,327
THE TEAM.

64
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,370
IF NOT, THERE COULD BE PROBLEMS.

65
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,266
>> I MEAN, THERE ARE SO MANY
THINGS I LOVE, I LOVE VIETNAMESE

66
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,312
FOOD, THAI FOOD, I LIKE CHINESE
FOOD, I LOVE ITALIAN.

67
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,357
I DON'T EVEN LIKE SWEETS BUT
BRING IT ON AND I'M GOING TO

68
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,610
HAVE A SLICE OF RED VELVET FROM
A BAKERY I USED TO WORK AT.

69
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,488
THE WEIRDEST THING I'VE BEEN
CRAVING IS A BANANA SHAKE WITH

70
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,031
PEANUT BUTTER IN IT.

71
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:04,369
LIKE I WANT THE TASTE OF PEANUT
BUTTER LIKE SNICKER DOODLES WITH

72
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,622
PEANUT BUTTER ON TOP AND MILK.

73
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,958
>> YOU'RE KILLING ME, SMALLS.

74
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,378
STEPHANIE CAME IN AND HER MOUTH
WAS GOING A MILE A MINUTE AND IT

75
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,004
WAS KIND OF ANNOYING.

76
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,673
I'M READY TO GO TO THE DUEL
RIGHT NOW.

77
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,840
I REALLY WANT TO WIN THIS ONE.

78
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,510
I TOLD GOD I'M GOING TO BE
OUT HERE AS LONG AS HE WANTS ME

79
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:24,472
TO BE OUT HERE SO I'M IN IT FOR
THE LONG HAUL.

80
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,522
>> TREE MAIL!

81
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,190
"HERE YOU GO AGAIN.

82
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,150
BY NOW, YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

83
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:40,863
SELECT YOUR REDEMPTION VISITORS
AND AGAIN, ONLY CHOOSE TWO."

84
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,198
WHO'S GOING?

85
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:43,157
>> I'M GOING TO GO.

86
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,244
IF THAT'S OKAY. BECAUSE IT'S MY
TURN AGAIN.

87
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,371
>> CAN I GO WITH YOU, PHILLIP?
>> SURE.

88
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,706
>> SO ROB AND PHILLIP.

89
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,249
>> THERE'S ANOTHER DUEL.

90
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,001
ROB AND I ARE GOING TO GO.

91
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,671
I JUST DON'T TRUST ROB ANYMORE
BECAUSE YESTERDAY ROB AND GRANT

92
00:04:56,754 --> 00:05:00,049
FOUND A CLUE TO AN IDOL AND I
WENT AND I FOLLOWED THEM.

93
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,719
AND WHEN ROB SAW ME HE TRIED TO
HIDE IT.

94
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,388
MIYAMOTO MUSASHI A VERY FAMOUS
JAPANESE HORSE MAN

95
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:09,183
ONCE WROTE A BOOK CALLED "THE
BOOK OF FIVE RINGS."

96
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:13,312
AND IN THE BOOK HE SAID WHAT YOU
WANT TO DO WHICH IS SO DIFFICULT

97
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,522
IS LET YOUR ENEMY MOVE FIRST,

98
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,400
AND THAT'S WHERE ROB'S WEAKNESS
IS.

99
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,068
HE LIKES TO BE EXTREMELY

100
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,612
CONTROLLING, AND HE WANTS TO
CONTROL ME.

101
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,407
AND ALL THE OTHER PLAYERS.

102
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,701
BUT NOBODY'S CONTROLLING ME.

103
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:27,493
>> YOU'VE GOT TO BRING YOUR
SHIRT.

104
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,578
>> I DO?

105
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,913
>> PHILLIP WANTED TO GO TO THE
DUEL.

106
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,291
HE'S NOT ALLOWED TO GO WITHOUT A
CHAPERONE SO I HAVE TO

107
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,126
BABY SIT HIS ASS FOR THE DAY.

108
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,335
PHILLIP HAS A BIG MOUTH.

109
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,047
HE LIKES TO TALK AND HE CAN'T BE
TRUSTED.

110
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,590
HE'S DANGEROUS BECAUSE OF HIS
STUPIDITY.

111
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,092
HE'S PROBABLY THE MOST UNAWARE

112
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,845
PERSON I'VE EVER MET IN MY
ENTIRE LIFE.

113
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,441
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

114
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,818
THE COMPETITORS FOR TODAY'S
DUEL.

115

STEPHANIE, VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

117
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,998
WELCOME TO REDEMPTION ISLAND
ARENA.

118
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,960
BOTH TRIBES HAVE SENT MEMBERS TO
WITNESS TODAY'S DUEL.

119
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,297
MATT, YOU SPENT 12 NIGHTS ON
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,507
YOU'VE WON FOUR DUELS.

121
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,593
ONCE AGAIN YOU FIND YOURSELF IN
A DO-OR-DIE SITUATION.

122
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,678
READY TO GET TO IT?

123
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,679

125
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,642
DIFFICULT ASPECTS OF THE GAME OF
"SURVIVOR" IS MENTAL FATIGUE.

126
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,646
CONVENIENTLY, TODAY'S DUEL WILL
TEST YOUR MEMORY.

127
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,482
>> PERFECT!

128
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:43,444
>> Jeff: SCATTERED IN THE ARENA
ARE PAIRS OF MATCHING SYMBOLS.

129
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,780
EACH ROUND YOU'LL FLIP OVER TWO
SYMBOLS.

130
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,782
IF THEY MATCH, YOU SCORE A
POINT.

131
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:53,329
FIRST TO FIVE STAYS ALIVE, LOSER
IS OUT OF THE GAME FOR GOOD.

132
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:55,039
THIS IS IT.

133

ALL RIGHT, STEPHANIE WON THE
ROCK, PAPER, SCISSOR.

136
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,471
SHE HAS ELECTED TO HAVE MATT GO

137
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,181
YOU'RE FLIPPING OVER TWO
SYMBOLS.

138
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,225

139
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,106
MATT FLIPS OVER A SKULL...

140
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,651
AND ANOTHER SKULL.

00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,735
STEPHANIE FLIPS OVER A WARRIOR.

170
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:48,778
>> ALL RIGHT.

171
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,779
TEMPLE.

172
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,949
>> Jeff: AND A TEMPLE.

173
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,742
NO MATCH FOR STEPHANIE.

174
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:58,663
DOOR OPEN FOR MATT TO TAKE A
BIGGER LEAD.

175
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,706
MATT FLIPS OVER THE EAGLE.

176
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,961
GOING TO TAKE A SHOT.

177
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,463
MATT FLIPS OVER ANOTHER EAGLE.

178
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:10,841
MATT NOW HAS THREE TO
STEPHANIE'S ONE.

179
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,761
WE ARE PLAYING TO FIVE.

180
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:14,887
>> OH.

181
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,764
>> Jeff: STEPHANIE FLIPS A
TEMPLE.

182
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,099
SHE KNOWS SHE'S SEEN ONE.

183
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:21,644
WHERE WAS IT?

184
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,771
NICE MATCH FOR STEPHANIE.

185
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:27,358
MATT LEADS 3-2.

186
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,402
MATT, YOU'RE UP.

187
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:38,828
MATT FLIPS OVER ONE CANOE,
LOOKING FOR A SECOND CANOE.

188
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,329
AND HE HAS IT.

189
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,999
MATT WITH NOW A VERY BIG LEAD.

190
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,501
MATT HAS 4, STEPHANIE HAS 2.

191
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:46,669
IT TAKES FIVE TO WIN.

192
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,630
STEPHANIE'S GOT TO GET A MATCH
HERE.

193
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,846
>> WARRIOR.

194
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,848
WHERE WERE YOU?

195
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,818
OH, MY GOD.
>> Jeff: AND SHE DOES.

196
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,903
STEPHANIE WITH HER THIRD MATCH.

197
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,488
KEEPS HERSELF IN THIS.

198
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,073
>> I'M LOSING MY MIND!

199
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,825
>> Jeff: MATT HAS 4, STEPHANIE
HAS 3.

200
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,244
IT TAKES 5 TO WIN.

201
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,871
MATT COULD DO IT RIGHT HERE.

202
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,669
MATT WITH A CALENDAR.

203
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,212
HAVE WE SEEN A CALENDAR?

204
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,548
>> YES, WE HAVE.

205
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,220
>> Jeff: MATT THOUGHT HE HAD
IT.

206
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:38,888
HE FLIPS THE HEAD DRESS.

207
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,931
NO MATCH.

208
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,434
DOOR OPEN FOR STEPHANIE NOW.

209
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:49,690
STEPHANIE QUICKLY FLIPS THE
CALENDAR.

210
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,284
AND THOUGHT SHE HAD IT.

211
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,078
GOT THE WAR CLUBS INSTEAD.

212
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,580
MATT VERY EXCITED NOW.

213
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:07,416
YOU CAN WIN THE DUEL RIGHT HERE.

214
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,586
MATT FLIPS OVER ONE WAR CLUB.

215
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,755
AND MATT FLIPS OVER THE SECOND
WAR CLUB.

216
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:16,467
FOR THE FIFTH TIME MATT STAYS
ALIVE, WILL LIVE TO SEE

217
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,594
ANOTHER DAY IN THIS GAME.

218
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:22,264
( APPLAUSE )

219
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,809
STEPHANIE, WHAT'S THE EMOTIONAL
FEELING RIGHT NOW WHEN YOU WANT

220
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:30,606
TO PLAY SO BADLY AND NOW YOU ARE
OUT?

221
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:33,609
>> JUST LEAVING ALTOGETHER
BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED TO BE

222
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:36,946
HERE UNTIL THE END SO JUST
LETTING GO OF THAT DREAM SUCKS.

223
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,159
I FEEL LIKE THERE ARE PEOPLE

224
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:42,952
HERE WHO DON'T DESERVE TO BE
HERE.

225
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,287
SARITA IS ONE OF THEM.

226
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,124
RALPH, IF YOU REALLY WANT TO
PLAY THE GAME, YOU NEED TO GET

227
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,084
RID OF HER SOON BECAUSE SHE'S
YOUR WEAKEST LINK.

228
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,836
AND I KNOW YOU THINK DAVE IS
BECAUSE HE VOTED WITH ME FOR

229
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,839
SARITA BUT HE'S THE ONLY GUY WHO
CAN DO PUZZLES.

230
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,925
DO YOU WANT TO TAKE ON THAT
RESPONSIBILITY?

231
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,135
>> IF I GOT TO DO IT, I WILL.

232
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,847
>> Jeff: ROB AND PHILLIP ARE
YOU TEMPTED TO SAY ANYTHING TO

233
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,473
THEM OR ARE THEY ON THEIR OWN?

234
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,308
>> I DON'T KNOW. ROB, LOOK OUT
BECAUSE THEY'RE

235
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,812
GOING TO TRY TO TAKE YOU OUT
LIKE THEY TOOK OUT RUSSELL SO

236
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,107
WATCH YOUR BACK AND I WOULDN'T
TRUST ANYONE ON THEIR TRIBE.

237
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,150
>> THANK YOU.
>> TRY TO WIN THIS GUY BACK.

238
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:18,988
BUT GOOD LUCK, BECAUSE HE'S BEEN
HERE A LONG TIME.

239
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,990
>> Jeff: STEPHANIE,
UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU,

240
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,576
THIS GAME IS OVER.

241
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,995
YOUR QUEST FOR THE MILLION
DOLLARS DONE.

242
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,997
>> THAT HURTS.

243
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,876
>> Jeff: YOU CAN PUT YOUR BUFF
IN THE FIRE ON YOUR WAY OUT.

244
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:43,637
MATT, ONCE AGAIN, YOU HAVE
SEIZED THE MOMENT AND LIVED TO

245
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,015
PLAY ANOTHER DAY IN THIS GAME.

246
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,851
PHILLIP, YOU'VE SEEN MATT
COMPETE TWICE NOW.

247
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,311
>> AND I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH
MATT.

248
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:53,063
IN THE OLD DAYS OF THE SAMURAI,
THEY HAD SOMETHING CALLED THE

249
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,400
BOCHUTO CODE, WHICH IS WHAT THE
SAMURAI LIVED BY.

250
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,236
WHAT I'VE SEEN IN YOU, YOU ARE
TRULY A SAMURAI WARRIOR.

251
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,529
>> THANK YOU, PHILLIP.

252
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,198
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.
>> I APPRECIATE IT.

253
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,575
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, MATT, YOU
CAN HEAD BACK TO REDEMPTION

254
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,035
ISLAND AND AWAIT YOUR NEXT
OPPONENT.

255
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,205
>> WILL DO, JEFF. YOU KNOW WHERE
TO FIND ME.

256
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,502
>> LITTLE PHILLIP COULDN'T KEEP
HIS MOUTH SHUT, AND I'M TELLING

257
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,713
YOU WHEN THE MERGE IS COMING,
PHILLIP IS READY TO MAKE A BIG

258
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:21,133
MOVE, AND BY "BIG MOVE" HE MEANS
LET'S GET ROB OUT.

259
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,363
>> I DON'T WANT TO SPLIT OUR
TRIBE, BRO.

260
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,782
>> I DON'T EITHER.
>> WE WANT TO STAY STRONG.

261
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,785
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO FEEL
LIKE WE'RE NOT ONE COHESIVE

262
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:48,369
UNIT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

263
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,954
>> OKAY, THEN TELL THEM.

264
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,289
IT'S YOUR CALL.

265
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,917
>> RIGHT WHEN WE GOT BACK,
PHILLIP ASKED ME HOW MUCH IF

266
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,420
ANY I WANTED TO TELL THE TRIBE
OF WHAT WENT ON.

267
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,548
WE'VE BEEN STRAIGHT UP SO FAR.

268
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:04,426
I'M NOT GOING TO START THAT
GAME, DUDE.

269
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,053
THAT'S NOT HOW I WANT TO PLAY.

270
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,054
>> ALL RIGHT, MAN.

271
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,639
>> I WASN'T UPSET THAT PHILLIP

272
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,057
SUGGESTED WE DON'T SAY ANYTHING
TO THE TRIBE.

273
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,019
IN ACTUALITY, I WAS HOPING FOR
IT, ACTUALLY PRAYING FOR HIM TO

274
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,313
SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO ME

275
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,566
SO I COULD JUST USE IT AS
AMUNITION.

276
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,985
AN OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS
ITSELF FOR ME TO

277
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,945
THROW PHILLIP UNDER THE BUS.

278
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:27,616
YOU GUYS MISSED A CRAZY, CRAZY,
CRAZY DUEL.

279
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,368
>> WHO DID THEY SEND?

280
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,120
>> THEY SENT STEPHANIE.

281
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,497
>> THAT'S WHAT WE FIGURED, YEAH.

282
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,917
>> JEFF WAS QUESTIONING HER, AND
SHE LET IT ALL HANG OUT.

283
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:40,087
SHE BASICALLY LOOKED AT ME AND
SHE'S LIKE, "ROB, WATCH OUT.

284
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,297
THEY'RE COMING FOR YOU."

285
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,009
I TOOK ALL THIS INFORMATION AND
RELAYED IT ALL TO THE TRIBE

286
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:47,261
BECAUSE I WANT EVERYBODY ON THE
SAME PAGE.

287
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,763
I WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW THAT
THE

288
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,225
TARGET'S ON ME SO THAT THEY FEEL
SAFE, NUMBER ONE, AND, NUMBER

289
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:57,021
TWO, I NEED TO KEEP EVERYBODY
ELSE AGAINST PHILLIP.

290
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,481
RIGHT WHEN WE WERE WALKING ON
THE BEACH HE'S LIKE,

291
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,316
"SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TELL
THEM?"

292
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,109
LIKE, HE DIDN'T WANT TO
TELL YOU GUYS.

293
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:06,196
AND I'M TELLING YOU, FIRST
OPPORTUNITY, THAT'S WHY,

294
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,531
HE'S FLIPPING.

295
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,991
>> YEAH, YEAH.
>> 100% HE'S FLIPPING BECAUSE WE

296
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,201
LOSE, HE'S GOES TO REDEMPTION.

297
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,872
AND EVERYTHING I JUST TOLD YOU
IS 100% TRUE.

298
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,790
WITH ALL THE ATTENTION FOCUSED
ON PHILLIP

299
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,126
AND EVERYBODY USING HIM AS A
PUNCHING BAG, I'M FREE TO

300
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,254
MANEUVER AND DO WHAT I NEED TO
DO.

301
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,175
>> PHILLIP, ARE YOU OKAY?

302
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,053
>> I'M FINE. THANK YOU.

303
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,848
>> EVERYTHING I SUSPECTED ABOUT
PHILLIP IS CONFIRMED.

304
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:35,809
IF WE LOSE, THERE WON'T BE ANY
BLINDSIDE.

305
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,020
I'LL GO RIGHT UP TO PHILLIP WHEN
HE ASKS ME WHO TO

306
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,521
VOTE FOR AND I'LL SAY, "YOU KNOW
WHAT, PHILLIP?

307
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,814
YOU'RE GOING HOME."

308
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,776
I'LL FRONT-SIDE HIM.

309
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,457
>> YEAH.
>> NOTHING TOO NASTY.

310
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,751
I MEAN NOTHING YOU WOULDN'T--
NOTHING UNEXPECTED.

311
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,212
>> SHE TOLD THE OTHER TEAM TO
PULL HARD, BEAT US.

312
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,506
>> DID SHE REALLY?
>> YES, SHE DID.

313
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,300
>> I DON'T THINK IT WAS
PARTICULARLY EGREGIOUS MANNER.

314
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,010
IT WAS NOTHING OUT OF THE

315
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,261
ORDINARY, NOTHING YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE EXPECTED.

316
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,889
>> HOW IS MATT DOING?

317
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:16,016
>> HE'S DOING GOOD, BUT HE'S FOR
THE OTHER TEAM.

318
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,228
HE AIN'T GOING TO SWAP SIDES SO
DON'T PLAN ON MATT FAVORING US.

319
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,739
>> YEAH, AND IF YOU FLIP...
>> AFTER THE MERGE...

320
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,573
>> NO ONE RESPECTS A FLIPPER.

321
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,034
>> THEN YOU'RE THE FIRST ONE TO
GO.

322
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,078
>> I THINK DAVID, IF WE MERGE,

323
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:39,790
HE WOULD JUMP TO THEIR TEAM,
JUST, BAM, LIKE THAT.

324
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,750
I DO BELIEVE.

325
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,210
WELL, HE'S A LAWYER, AND

326
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,921
LAWYERS, YOU GOTTA LOOK AT THEM
THAT WAY.

327
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:48,757
THEY'RE-- THEY THINK THEY'RE A
LOT BETTER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE.

328
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,135
>> TODAY IS THE DAY TO FISH.

329
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:54,179
FIRST TIME WE CAUGHT THEM ALL
WAS AFTER A BIG STORM.

330
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,269
>> WHEN THE WATER IS DUMPING OUT
FROM THERE, THAT'S WHEN ALL THE

331
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:04,356
BAIT FISH WASH OUT FROM THE
RIVER LIKE THE MINNOW AND BRING

332
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,526
THE BIGGER FISH IN TO SHORE.

333
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,323
>> THE 30-YEAR-OLD DAVID
ATTORNEY IS TELLING

334
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,160
THE 45-YEAR-OLD RALPH, MR.
OUTDOORSMAN, THAT WE

335
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,287
OUGHT TO GO FISHING.

336
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,539
SO DAVE IS GETTING TOUGH TO
STOMACH.

337
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:27,129
>> OKAY, DAVE IS BUGGING ME.

338
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,422
>> YEAH.

339
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,298
>> WE SHOULD GO FISH NOW." YOU
KNOW.

340
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,592
LIKE SHUT UP.

341
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,303
I WANT TO, LIKE, PUNCH HIM IN
THE FACE, HIM AND HIS SMIRK.

342
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,306
IT'S LIKE PICKING HIS WOUND.

343
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,807
>> YOU SEE THAT THE FACE HE
MADE?

344
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,225
>> NO. >> SARITA, SHOW THE FACE
HE MADE.

345
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:44,104
>> HE'S LIKE YOU GUYS OUGHT TO
BE FISH YOU NOW AND HE'S LIKE...

346
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:48,650
DAVID'S PERSONALITY IS I FIND
HIM SELFISH AND EGOTISTICAL.

347
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:53,280
AS MUCH AS HE THINKS HE'S THE
KING OF RIDING THE WILD WATERS

348
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:59,453
OF "SURVIVOR" HE ISN'T SAVVY AT
THE SOCIAL GAME AT ALL.

349
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,331
>> I'M GUESSING STEVE'S NOT REAL
HAPPY WITH THE FACT THAT I

350
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,249
DECIDED TO DO MY OWN THING LAST
NIGHT.

351
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,209
>> I DON'T KNOW.

352
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,837
DAVID, HE MIGHT BE SMART, BUT IT

353
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,756
DON'T TAKE SMART TO WIN THIS
GAME.

354
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:14,176
IT JUST TAKES SOMEBODY THAT
KNOWS HOW TO MANEUVER AROUND AND

355
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,469
PLAY THE BALL.

356
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:20,808
WHEN IT COMES OUT HERE IN THE
GENERAL WORLD, SURVIVIN', HE'S

357
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,267
GOT TO GO.

358
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,549
>> HE PROBABLY WILL ONLY EAT
THAT.

359
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,930
DON'T EAT TOO MUCH OF THE CRISPY
STUFF.

360
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,557
I TOLD HIM I WOULD SAVE IT FOR
HIM.

361
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,391
>> THERE'S PLENTY OF IT.

362
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,269
>> YEAH, THERE'S A LOT.

363
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,149
>> I THINK ROB WILL LIKE THE
STUFF ON THE BOTTOM.

364
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,362
>>I WANT ONE SCOOP OF THE
CRISPY, OKAY, JUST ONE.

365
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:18,407
>> THAT'S ALL ROB IS GOING TO
EAT.

366
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,534
>> BUT I DIDN'T HAVE ONE SCOOP
OF THE CRISPY.

367
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,743
>> WE DIDN'T EITHER.

368
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,911
>> WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY.

369
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,331
>> PHILLIP, REALLY.

370
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,457
>> FORGET IT.

371
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,253
>> YOU CAN HAVE ALL YOU WANT.

372
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,255
>> I MEAN, I DON'T SEE WHERE ONE

373
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,549
SCOOP OF THE CRISPY WOULD
MATTER.

374
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:38,427
>> IT'S ROB'S SERVING. IT'S
FINE.

375
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,430
>> WHEN WE MAKE IT, GUYS, WE'RE
ALL ENTITLED TO WHATEVER IS

376
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,807
MADE, OKAY, IN EQUAL
PROPORTIONS.

377
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:47,436
SO IF I WANTED A SCOOP OF CRISPY
AND-- LOOK, I SAW YOU GUYS

378
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,897
GET A SCOOP OF THE CRISPY.

379
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,607
LET'S NOT MAKE A MOUNTAIN OUT OF

380
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,983
A MOLE HILL, FOR CRYING OUT
LOUD.

381
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,776
I'M STANDING RIGHT THERE.

382
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,487
>> HERE, BRO.
>> I DON'T WANT IT.

383
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,324
WHENEVER I-- IT'S LIKE, ROB,
ROB, ROB, ROB, ROB, ROB, ROB!

384
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,459
EVERYBODY LIKES THE BROWN CRISPY

385
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,961
RICE, BUT ROB LIKES IT IN
PARTICULAR.

386
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,797
I WALKED OVER AND SAID, "CAN I
HAVE A LITTLE SCOOP, A SPOONFUL,

387
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,258
A TEASPOONFUL OF THE CRISPY?"

388
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,802
"NO, NO, NO, YOU CAN'T. IT'S ALL
FOR ROB.

389
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,179
EVEN THOUGH THERE'S A FULL
PORTION.

390
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,555
YOU CAN HAVE SOME OF THAT

391
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,807
BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY OF THE
CRISPY."

392
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,976
HOW ASININE IS THAT?

393
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,439
>> RIGHT HERE.
>> I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THE

394
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:36,318
FACT THAT THEY ACT LIKE BECAUSE
BOSTON ROB IS BOSTON ROB, HE

395
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,071
GETS DEFERENCE TO EVERYTHING.

396
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,615
JUST BECAUSE THEY SLEEP IN HIS
UNDERWEAR EVERY NIGHT-- AND

397
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,493
THAT'S NOT SPEAKING
FIGURATIVELY, THAT'S LITERALLY--

398
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:48,580
THEY'RE SHARING HIS UNDERWEAR,
THE GIRLS, HIS SOCKS, HIS BED,

399
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,209
AND SO THEY WANT TO PAY HIM
DEFERENCE ON EVERYTHING.

400
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,006
>> LET IT BE KNOWN, THE FIRST

401
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,175
OPPORTUNITY I HAVE TO ELIMINATE
HIM, I WILL.

402
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,135
>> LET HIM EAT THAT.
>> THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

403
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,846
AND HE SAID, "NO. I DON'T WANT
THAT."

404
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,726
>> "DON'T MAKE A MOUNTAIN OUT OF
A MOLE HILL."

405
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,770
>> OH, WELL.

406
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,817
>> ALL DUE RESPECT, I'M A
52-YEAR-OLD MAN, AND THE SENIOR

407
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,527
MEMBER OF THIS TRIBE.

408
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,363
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WORLD THEY'RE
COMING FROM, BUT IN ANY OTHER

409
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,698
WORLD, I WOULD BE GIVEN THE

410
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,908
DEFERENCE SIMPLY BECAUSE OF MY
AGE.

411
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,535
I'M CERTAINLY ENTITLED TO IT, IF

412
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,870
WE'RE GOING TO CALL THIS A
TRIBE.

413
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,666
BUT INSTEAD I GET THE REDHEADED
STEPCHILD TREATMENT.

414
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,046
>> AM I FEELING PART OF THIS
TRIBE?

415
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,881
HELL NO!

416
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,384
AM I GIVING 100% TO THIS TRIBE,
110% TO THIS TRIBE?

417
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,886
HELL YEAH!

418
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,888
AND I'M SICK OF IT.

419
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,558
I'M NOT QUITTING, I'M HERE TO
STAY, BUT I WANT IT

420
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,728
TO BE ON RECORD THERE IS A
DIVISION IN THIS TRIBE, NOT OF

421
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,813
MY MAKING, OF THEIR MAKING.

422
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,484
THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.

423
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,331
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

424
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:30,557

IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

425
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,767

426
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,601
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST, I

427
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,686
BACK AGAIN, OMETEPE.

428
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,609
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.

429
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:45,614
ON MY GO, BOTH TRIBES WILL RACE
THROUGH A SERIES OF OBSTACLES

430
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:49,951
WORKING TOGETHER TO COLLECT BAGS
OF BALLS ALONG THE WAY.

431
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,621
ONCE YOU'VE CLEARED ALL THE
OBSTACLES, YOU MUST SHOOT THE

432
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,457
BALLS INTO A BASKET.

433
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,669
FIRST TRIBE TO GET ALL SIX BALLS
IN THEIR BASKET WINS IMMUNITY,

434
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:00,921
IS SAFE FROM THE VOTE.

435
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:04,633
LOSERS GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL
WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT

436
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,677
OF THE TRIBE AND SENT TO
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

437
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,221
ANY QUESTIONS?

438
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,807

>> WHAT ARE WE PLAYING FOR?

439
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,435

PLAYING FOR REWARD.

440
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,314
THE WINNING TRIBE WILL LEAVE
HERE VIA HELICOPTER, TAKEN FOR A

503
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,591
>> OH, MAN!

504
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,515
>> Jeff: ROB HAS THE THIRD AND
FINAL BAG FOR OMETEPE.

505
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,976
GRANT THROUGH THE WALL!
EVERYBODY THROUGH THE WALL!

506
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,814
>> Jeff: PHILLIP SMASHES THROUGH
THE BRICKS.

507
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,233
OMETEPE NOW THROUGH THE WALL!

508
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,574
GOTTA GET ALL SIX BALLS IN THE
BASKET.

509
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:00,118
BOTH TRIBES ALREADY SHOOTING
BALLS NOW.

00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,871
OMETEPE HAS THEIR FIRST BALL IN.

511
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:06,875
RALPH NOT HAVING ANY LUCK.

512
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,543
GRANT IS TWO FOR TWO.

513
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:09,753
GRANT HAS TWO IN FOR OMETEPE.

514
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:13,465
ZAPATERA WITH ZERO.

00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:17,385
ZAPATERA HAS THEIR FIRST BALL.

516
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,803
OMETEPE HAS THEIR THIRD BALL.

517
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:24,351
ZAPATERA WITH THEIR SECOND BALL.

518
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,562
THEIR THIRD BALL.

519
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,397
WE ARE TIED 3-3.

520
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,024
THERE ARE SIX BALLS TOTAL.

521
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:34,194
GOTTA GET ALL SIX IN.

522
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:37,572

ZAPATERA HAS THEIR FIFTH BALL
IN.

524
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,869
ZAPATERA HAS ONE LEFT.

525
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,913
GRANT PUTS ONE IN FOR OMETEPE.

526
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,748
IT IS 5-4.

527
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:50,877
BIG REWARD AND BIGGER IMMUNITY
ON THE LINE.

528
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,339
OMETEPE WITH THEIR FIFTH BALL
IN.

529
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:57,759
BOTH TRIBES HAVE ONE LEFT.

530
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,387
OMETEPE-- OH, IN AND OUT.

531
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,518
GRANT DOES IT!

532
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:10,522
OMETEPE WINS IMMUNITY AND
REWARD!

533
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,736
>> OH, MAN!

534
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,321
>> SORRY, GUYS.

535
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,781
>> COME ON.

536
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,492
>> WE ALMOST LOST YOU, PHILLIP.

537
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,536
>> WE WERE CLOSE.

538
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:34,003
>> Jeff: OMETEPE, ONCE AGAIN
CONGRATULATIONS.

539
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:41,177
ALL RIGHT, ZAPATERA, YOU ARE NOW
DOWN TO SIX MEMBERS.

540
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:44,305
AFTER TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL,
FIVE.

541
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,641
THINGS ARE GOING FROM BAD TO
WORSE.

542
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:48,143
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

543
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:51,438
I WILL SEE YOU TONIGHT WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT AND

544
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,814
SENT TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

545
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,484
OMETEPE, NO TRIBAL COUNCIL
TONIGHT.

546
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,778
SHOULD BE A NICE, ENJOYABLE DAY.

547
00:28:58,862 --> 00:28:59,988
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

548
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,614
( APPLAUSE )

549
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,954
>> SOME TRIBES ADVANCE BOLDLY.

550
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:12,000
WEAK TRIBES GROW AGITATED.

551
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:17,172
BUT SUPERIOR TRIBES, LIKE OURS,
WE FIND A WAY TO WIN.

552
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,174
AND WE DID.

553
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,665
>> THIS IS MY FOURTH TIME ON
"SURVIVOR" AND I'VE BEEN ON A

554
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:56,294
LOT OF REWARDS, BUT I'LL TELL
YOU WHAT I'VE NEVER DONE IS

555
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,046
LANDED ON TOP OF AN ACTIVE
VOLCANO.

556
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,089
DEFINITELY ONE OF THE

557
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,592
COOLEST EXPERIENCES I'VE EVER
HAD.

558
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:03,885
>> WHOA!
>> BE CAREFUL.

559
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,887
>> WATCH YOUR FEET, Y'ALL.

560
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,222
>> TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.

561
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,348
>> OH, MY GOD!

562
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:11,226
>> WHOO!
>> WOW.

563
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,852
>> HELLO! HELLO!

564
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,062
>> IT'S A HOLE IS THAT GOES

565
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,064
STRAIGHT TO THE CENTER OF THE
EARTH.

566
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:20,235
>> LITERALLY, I AM SITTING ON
THE EDGE OF A VOLCANO RIGHT NOW.

567
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,195
I'M LOOKING DOWN AT IT RIGHT
NOW, BRO.

568
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:24,030
I COULD FALL IN HERE AND NEVER
BE HEARD FROM AGAIN.

569
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:27,617
>> OMETEPE!

570
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,411
>> AND WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT IT
IS WE GET TO DO IT AS A TRIBE

571
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,871
TOGETHER AND JUST ENJOY IT.

572
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,081
>> WHAT DO WE GOT?

573
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,124
( CHEERING )

574
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:39,420
>> WHAT'S IN THERE?
>> CRACKERS.

575
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,630
>> CRACKERS!

576
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:41,631
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!

577
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,967
I'M ACTUALLY HAVING AN
INCREDIBLE DAY TODAY.

578
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,760
WE HAVE A NUMBERS ADVANTAGE.

579
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:47,971
AND FOR ME, I HAVEN'T ALWAYS
FELT LIKE I WAS TOTALLY

580
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,431
INCLUSIVE WITH THE GROUP.

581
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,058
BUT TODAY, HAVING A WONDERFUL
MEAL RIGHT NOW.

582
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,394
>> OH, MY GOSH!

583
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:55,436
>> DELICIOUS.

584
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,646
>> MMM!

585
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,439
AND SURVIVING WITH THE TRIBE.

586
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,608
>> WE WON AGAIN!
>> WE WON AGAIN!

587
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:04,404
>> I FIND IT HARD NOT TO BE
TRIBAL IN MY THINKING, COMMUNITY

588
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:07,240
IN MY THINKING, SO RIGHT NOW I'M
ON TOP OF THE EARTH.

589
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,741
>> WE GOT TO KEEP THIS GOING.

590
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,451
>> COMEBACK KIDS.

591
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,120
>> THEY ARE GOOD BUT WE ARE
BETTER.

592
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,663
>> WHAT'S IN THAT JAR RIGHT
THERE?

593
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,248
>> OH, DUDE, TRY IT.
THEY'RE SO GOOD.

594
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,958
CHOCOLATE SWIRLED IN WAFER.

595
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,002
>> I'VE BEEN ON ENOUGH REWARDS
TO KNOW WHENEVER YOU WIN ONE,

596
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,337
THERE'S GONNA BE A CLUE.

597
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:25,008
SO IMMEDIATELY IT HITS ME, THE
COOKIES ARE CYLINDRICAL SHAPED.

598
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,467
THE CLUE'S GOT TO BE IN THERE.

599
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,803
>> THOSE WILL MAKE YOUR HEART
STOP.

600
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:30,597
>> AND SURE ENOUGH IN THE CENTER
IS A CLUE

601
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,265
WRAPPED UP LIKE A COOKIE.

602
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:33,766
>> DO YOU PUT PESTO ON YOUR
SANDWICH?

603
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,309
>> NO. YOU HAVE SOME?

604
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,186
>> DUDE, IT'S SO GOOD!

605
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,647
BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T EVEN
MATTER WHAT IT SAYS BECAUSE I

606
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,483
ALREADY HAVE THE IDOL, SO...

607
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,361
MIGHT AS WELL JUST THROW IT AWAY
IN THE VOLCANO!

608
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,822
BYE-BYE!

609
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,499
>> THAT CERTAINLY SUCKED.

610
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,877
SO TODAY'S CHALLENGE WAS AN
AWESOME CHALLENGE.

611
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,879
THE OUTCOME COMPLETELY SUCKED.

612
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,882
THAT'S THREE LOSSES IN A ROW,
ALL THREE FOR FOOD.

613
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:06,591
WE'RE STARVING OUT HERE.

614
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,635
WE'RE TIRED OF GOING TO TRIBAL.

615
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:12,347
AFTER TONIGHT IT'S GOING TO BE
SIX OF THEM AND FIVE OF US.

616
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,933
NOT A GOOD SITUATION WITH A
LOOMING MERGE.

617
00:32:23,941 --> 00:32:24,525
>> SO WHAT DO WE THINK?

618
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,235
THIS IS PROBABLY THE ONLY TIME

619
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,862
WE'RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO
TALK.

620
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:29,781
>> I WAS THINKING DAVE.

621
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,199
>> ARE YOU GUYS FEELING GOOD
ABOUT LOSING THE PUZZLE MAKER?

622
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:35,036
I WANT THE TRIBE TO WIN.

623
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,331
>> MICHAEL CAN MORE THAN FILL
HIS SHOES ON THE PUZZLES.

624
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:41,209
>> I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM DO
ANYTHING TOO OUTSTANDING AT ANY

625
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,586
OF THE CHALLENGES.

626
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,714
>> I FEEL LIKE I CAN DO ANYTHING
DAVE CAN DO AND I FEEL LIKE--

627
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,174
BECAUSE I WOULD SAY KICK ME OFF

628
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:50,051
IF I FELT LIKE DAVE WAS BETTER
THAN ME.

629
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,720
I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE HE IS.

630
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,431
I-- I DON'T THINK HE'S GOOD.

631
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,685
TONIGHT IN TRIBAL COUNCIL I'M
GOING TO VOTE FOR DAVID BECAUSE

632
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:03,564
HE'S A LOOSE CANNON, AND KNOWING
THAT HE VOTED FOR ME LAST TIME,

633
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:07,235
KNOWING THAT HE DOESN'T TRUST ME
AT ALL, IT DOESN'T REALLY BODE

634
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,237
WELL FOR THE FUTURE.

635
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,738
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?

636
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,406
>> I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE ON THE PROGRAM.

637
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,074
I TALKED TO THE OTHER FOUR.

638
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,201
>> YOU HAVE?
>> YEAH.

639
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,244
>> THEY WANT TO GET DAVE?

640
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,916
>> IT'S BESIDE THE POINT.

641
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:24,252
I DON'T TRUST DAVE NOT TO GET
TOGETHER WITH THEM BEFORE THE

642
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,086
END OF THE DAY AND GET ONE OF US
OFF.

643
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,212
I REALLY DON'T.

644
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,923
I DON'T TRUST DAVE AT ALL.

645
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:29,966
>> NO, I DON'T EITHER.

646
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,135
>> BUT I DEFINITELY THINK THIS
NEXT ONE IS DAVE.

647
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:35,638
>> YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

648
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,307
>> I FEEL LIKE DAVID IS GOING TO
HAVE A REALLY GOOD CHANCE OF

649
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,144
BEATING BOY WONDER ON REDEMPTION
ISLAND, WHICH I DON'T WANT TO

650
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,604
SEE HIM COME BACK.

651
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:47,275
HE'S GOING TO COME BACK LIKE
A HELL ON WHEELS FOR ME, BUT...

652
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:51,487
THE GAME IS THE GAME.

653
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,239
>> I FEEL A LITTLE BIT MORE
NERVOUS TONIGHT THAN I HAVE IN

654
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:56,284
THE PAST, PRIMARILY BECAUSE I
DON'T KNOW THAT THE TRIBE HAS

655
00:33:56,367 --> 00:34:00,121
SEEN THE LIGHT IN TERMS OF
KEEPING STRENGTH.

656
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,249
LAST TIME, NOBODY WAS INTERESTED
IN FOCUSING ON STRENGTH OF THE

657
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,500
TRIBE, AND THEY WANTED TO FOCUS
ON TRUST.

658
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:08,504
IF THAT HAPPENS AGAIN, THERE'S A
DISTINCT POSSIBILITY I AM THE

659
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,047
ONE GOING HOME.

660
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,257
>> HERE COMES DAVE.

661
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,177
GOOD WORK!

662
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,263
>> I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM PICK UP
THAT BIG A PIECE OF LUMBER

663
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,347
SINCE WE'VE BEEN HERE.

664
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,767
>> YEAH, EXACTLY.

665
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,643
>> WE WERE GOING TO TARGET
DAVID.

666
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,937
BUT SARITA STRUGGLED TODAY.

667
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,482
SHE FUMBLED A COUPLE OF TIMES,
COULDN'T GET THE BAG OPEN,

668
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,316
SHE STARTED PANICKING.

669
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,485
IT JUST WASN'T COMING TOGETHER
FOR HER.

670
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,529
DAVID, ON THE OTHER HAND, REALLY
CAME THROUGH FOR US.

671
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:42,789
>> FOR THE STRENGTH OF THE TRIBE
IN CHALLENGES, WE THINK WE'VE

672
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,040
GOT TO KEEP DAVE.

673
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:46,334
>> REALLY?

674
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:49,504
>> IN MY EYES, YOU KNOW, I DON'T
TRUST DAVID.

675
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,130
>> I DON'T TRUST HIM AT ALL.

676
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,173
>> I LOVE SARITA, I THINK SHE'S
GREAT BUT SHE'S

677
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:56,385
BEEN SUPER, SUPER WEAK AT EVERY
CHALLENGE.

678
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,806
SHE TENDS TO GET FLUSTERED AND
FREAKED OUT A LITTLE BIT.

679
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:03,518
SHE JUST DOESN'T HAVE THAT
INTESTINAL FORTITUDE, YOU KNOW.

680
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,353
SHE'S ABSOLUTE THE WEAKEST AT
THIS POINT.

681
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:09,565
TONIGHT WE HAVE TWO OPTIONS--
DAVID OR SARITA.

682
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:12,235
SARITA VERY LOYAL, VERY
TRUSTWORTHY.

683
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,362
HOWEVER, IN CHALLENGES SHE'S

684
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,532
VERY FLUSTERED AND NOT VERY
STRONG.

685
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,867
DAVID, ON THE OTHER HAND, HE'S A
THINKER.

686
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:20,535
HE'S VERY SMART.

687
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,370
I THINK HE'LL HELP US GET

688
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,579
THROUGH FUTURE CHALLENGES WITH
PUZZLES.

689
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:27,291
HOWEVER, HE'S A LITTLE BIT
HARDER TO TRUST, AND IF WE END

690
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,210
UP MERGING SOME TIME SOON, WHO

691
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:32,004
DO WE WANT TO HAVE WITH US AT
THE MERGE?

692
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,840
IT'S A TOTAL CATCH-22 AT THIS
POINT.

693
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,716
EITHER WE HAVE A LOYAL TRIBE OR

694
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,885
WE HAVE A TAD BIT STRONGER
TRIBE.

695
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,847
RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN A BIT OF A
TAILSPIN AND WE HAVE A COUPLE

696
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,266
THOUSAND FEET BEFORE WE HIT THE
DECK AND CRASH AND BURN SO WE

697
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:46,310
NEED TO FIGURE A WAY OUT OF THIS
TAILSPIN.

698
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,244
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, RALPH, YOU

699
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,622
TELL ME-- WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO
ZAPATERA?

700
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:09,458
>> JEFF, IT WAS PRETTY CLOSE
TODAY.

701
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,794
WE WAS AHEAD, BUT WHEN IT GOT TO
THE BALLS...

702
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,421
>> CAN I PIPE IN?

703
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,922
>> YES.

704
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:18,050
>> Jeff: DAVID, FINISH THIS
SENTENCE, "EXCUSES ARE FOR..."?

705
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,302
>> LOSERS.

706
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,805
>> I'M A LOSER THEN.

707
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:26,100
>> Jeff: JULIE, THERE IS ONE
GLARING STAT.

708
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:29,270
SINCE YOU THREW THE CHALLENGE TO
GET RID OF RUSSELL YOU HAVE LOST

709
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,273
THE NEXT THREE OF FOUR
CHALLENGES.

710
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,609
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
IT IS BAD KARMA.

711
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,528
AT THE TIME, JEFF, WE THOUGHT
OUR TRIBE WAS WAY STRONGER THAN

712
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,406
THE OTHER TRIBE AND WE THOUGHT
WE COULD SPARE TO THROW ONE

713
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:43,659
CHALLENGE AND WE STILL FEEL LIKE

714
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,703
WE'RE STRONGER THAN THE OTHER
TRIBE.

715
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,789
>> Jeff: DAVID, MAYBE THE
PROBLEM ISN'T THAT YOU'RE NOT AS

716
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:49,790
STRONG AS THE OTHER TRIBE.

717
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,418
MAYBE THE PROBLEM IS YOU'RE JUST
NOT AS COHESIVE.

718
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,086
>> I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
THE PROBLEM IS.

719
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,005
IT'S A LACK OF UNITY HERE.

720
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,340
WHEN WE WERE BANDED TOGETHER
AGAINST RUSSELL THAT WAS

721
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:00,801
SOMETHING WE ALL HAD A SIMILAR
GOAL TOWARDS.

722
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,303
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER

723
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,430
TRIBE, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE ALL
FRIENDS.

724
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:05,765
THEY'RE ALL SITTING THERE

725
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,642
LAUGHING, GIGGLING, AND HAVING A
GOOD TIME.

726
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:11,103
IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT'S A
COMPONENT OF THEIR DAILY LIFE.

727
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,606
>> Jeff: RALPH, DOES THAT RING
TRUE TO YOU, HOW IMPORTANT IT IS

728
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:16,150
THAT THE ENTIRE GROUP BE
COHESIVE?

729
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:19,570
>> WELL, FIRST, JEFF, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT "COHESIVE" MEANS.

730
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,490
>> Jeff: WELL IN YOUR JOB YOU
MANAGE A GROUP OF GUYS, RIGHT?

731
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,909
>> YES.
>> Jeff: WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE

732
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,662
A DOZEN GUYS WHO ARE REALLY
STRONG BUT DIDN'T GET ALONG VERY

733
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,456
WELL OR A DOZEN GUYS THAT MAYBE
AREN'T THAT STRONG BUT WORK

734
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,833
WELL AS A UNIT.

735
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,335
>> I DISAGREE.

736
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,670
>> Jeff: IT'S A QUESTION.

737
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,296
WHICH WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE?

738
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,799
>> I WOULD RATHER HAVE ONES THAT
ARE STRONGER BECAUSE IF THEY DO

739
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:42,385
GET ALONG, YAK, YAK, YAK, YAK.

740
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,012
>> I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE.

741
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,057
I THINK ANY COACH WOULD RATHER
HAVE A GROUP THAT GETS ALONG.

742
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,851
AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE'RE
ALL WORKING TOGETHER.

743
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,646
>> Jeff: KRISTA WOULD
DISAGREE, STEPHANIE WOULD

744
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,523
DISAGREE, AND FROM WHAT I SEE
RECENTLY BETWEEN DAVID AND

745
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:59,068
SARITA, DAVID WOULD PROBABLY
DISAGREE.

746
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,737
>> THAT'S WHY KRISTA AND
STEPHANIE ARE GONE.

747
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,531
THEY WERE THE DISSENTERS AMONG
THE GROUP.

748
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:08,703
DAVID MAY DISAGREE BUT I KNOW
THAT WE FEEL WE'RE STRONGER.

749
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,831
>> Jeff: DAVID, YOU HAVE BEEN
PRETTY VOCAL IN YOUR SUPPORT OF

750
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,541
KRISTA AND STEPHANIE.

751
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,168
ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT MAY NOW
PUT THE TARGET ON YOU?

752
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,503
>> ABSOLUTELY.

753
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:21,048
STEPHANIE'S REFUSAL TO VOTE WITH
THE TRIBE AND INSTEAD VOTING

754
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,135
WITH KRISTA TIPPED THE SCALES
AGAINST HER ULTIMATELY.

755
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,887
THE FACT THAT I DID THE SAME
THING AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL

756
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:30,224
CONCERNS ME BUT I GAVE STEPHANIE
MY WORD.

757
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:33,352
AND I'M NOT GONNA JUMP BACKWARDS
AT THAT POINT.

758
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,564
>> Jeff: SARITA, DAVID MAKES
THE ARGUMENT BY KEEPING HIS WORD

759
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,900
HE IS ACTUALLY SHOWING HE'S
LOYAL.

760
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,903
>> THAT DOESN'T REALLY FLY WITH
ME

761
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,864
JUST BECAUSE I TRUSTED IN THE
SIX.

762
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,532
>> I TRUSTED IN THE SIX AND I

763
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,367
DON'T HAVE ANY INDIVIDUAL TRUST
IN YOU.

764
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,619
>> I WAS SURPRISED WHEN DAVID
VOTED FOR ME LAST WEEK.

765
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,414
I THOUGHT THE SIX WAS STRONG AND
NO MATTER WHAT DIFFERENCES WE

766
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,915
HAD I WOULD NEVER HAVE WRITTEN

767
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,084
HIS NAME DOWN BECAUSE I DO HONOR
MY ALLIANCES.

768
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,253
BUT THEN HE YELLED AT ME A
COUPLE OF TIMES

769
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:02,256
AND GOT ME IN MY FACE AND THAT'S
NOT A PERSON I CAN TRUST.

770
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:05,217
IT DOESN'T MEAN THE SIX CHANGE,
IT MEANT THAT I WASN'T

771
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,927
GONNA BE THICK AS THIEVES WITH
DAVID.

772
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,430
>> CARRY ON AFTER THE SIX SO
THERE WAS BASICALLY NO ALLIANCE

773
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,891
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US BUT SHE
WAS STILL WILLING TO WORK WITH

774
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,142
ME WITHIN THE SIX.

775
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:16,645
>> WE HAD AN AGREEMENT FOR THE
SIX AND WE HAD A HIERARCHY OF

776
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:19,899
WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO, AND HE
FLIPPED ON THAT AND DECIDED TO

777
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,233
ALIGN WITH STEPHANIE.

778
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,234
>> I DIDN'T FLIP ON ANY
HIERARCHY.

779
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,445
I DID WHAT I THOUGHT WAS BEST
FOR THE TRIBE.

780
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,738
>> OKAY.

781
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,823
>> Jeff: BUT TONIGHT, THINGS
ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE IS

782
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:28,699
NO STEPHANIE AND THERE IS NO
KRISTA.

783
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,951
>> AND MY NAME WAS WRITTEN DOWN.

784
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,162
>> Jeff: SO NOW YOU'RE GUNNING
FOR DAVID.

785
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:35,414
>> UM...

786
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,582
>> OF COURSE SHE IS.
IT'S OBVIOUS.

787
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:37,833
THAT QUESTION DOESN'T EVEN NEED
TO BE ASKED.

788
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:41,629
IF SHE THINKS I'VE BETRAYED THE
ALLIANCE OF COURSE SHE'S GOING

789
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,963
TO GO AFTER ME.

790
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,133
I DIDN'T PLEAD MY CASE TO ANYONE
THIS AFTERNOON.

791
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,927
EVERYONE HAS THEIR MIND MADE UP.

792
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:50,846
WHETHER IT'S ME OR HER, SO BE
IT.

793
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:51,764
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, WELL THIS

794
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:54,683
GROUP OF SIX IS ABOUT TO BE
BROKEN UP.

795
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:58,187
IT'S TIME TO VOTE.
JULIE, YOU'RE UP.

796
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,490
>> I WAS ALWAYS HONEST WITH YOU,
AND YOU BETRAYED ME.

797
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,868
IT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE YOU
HAVE A LOT OF GREAT QUALITIES.

798
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:20,960
>> I HOPE YOU LOVE REDEMPTION

799
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:24,463
ISLAND AS MUCH AS I LOVE WRITING
YOUR NAME DOWN.

800
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,561
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

801
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:48,154
ONCE THE VOTES ARE ARE READ,
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

802
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,322
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

803
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:51,532
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

804
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:52,700
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

805
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:57,913
FIRST VOTE, SARITA.

806
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,751
DAVID.

807
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:06,213
TWO VOTES DAVID, ONE VOTE
SARITA.

808
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,385
SARITA.

809
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,762
WE'RE TIED-- TWO VOTES SARITA,
TWO VOTES DAVID.

810
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,391
SARITA.

811
00:41:17,474 --> 00:41:20,978
THAT'S THREE VOTES SARITA, TWO
VOTES DAVID, ONE VOTE LEFT.

812
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,399
SEVENTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF

813
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:27,568
"SURVIVOR: REDEMPTION ISLAND,"
SARITA.

814
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:28,611
>> OH, MY GOD. >> Jeff: NEED TO
BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

815
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:31,113
>> I WISH I'D BROUGHT MY STUFF.

816
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,699
>> DON'T GET TOO CONFIDENT.

817
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,540
>> Jeff: SARITA, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

818
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,042
>> THANK YOU.

819
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,585
BYE, GUYS.

820
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,755
>> Jeff: YOU WILL HAVE A
CHANCE TO GET BACK IN THIS GAME.

821
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,257
GRAB YOUR TORCH, HEAD TO
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

822
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,593
GOOD LUCK.

823
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:00,601
WELL, IF THERE WAS ANY QUESTION
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS ONE

824
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:05,606
COHESIVE GROUP, TONIGHT'S TRIBAL
COUNCIL CERTAINLY ANSWERED IT.

825
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,440
NO.

826
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:08,442
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

827
00:42:08,525 --> 00:42:09,860
GOOD NIGHT.

828
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,995
>> JEFF: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

829
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,584
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR":

830
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:26,961
>> THAT CUT MY FOOT PRETTY
BADLY.

831
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,337
>> Jeff: AN INJURY HURTS

832
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,673
MATT'S CHANCES IN THE MOST
IMPORTANT DUEL YET.

833
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,800
THE WINNER OF TODAY'S DUEL WILL
GO BACK IN THE GAME.

834
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,803
AND ROB HEARS THE THREE WORDS
THAT COULD PUT AN END TO HIS

835
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:39,306
DOMINANCE-- WE ARE MERGED.

836
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,599
>> THIS IS A WHOLE NEW GAME.

837
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,142
>> I CAN SEE PARANOIA GETTING TO
HIM.

838
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,478
>> I KNOW THEY'RE COMING AFTER
ME.

839
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,820
>> IN THE END, DAVID WON OUT,
BASICALLY SAYING HE WAS THE

840
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,614
STRONGER, WHICH IS FINE.

841
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,825
WHAT THEY DON'T REALIZE IS YOU
DON'T ALWAYS PICK THE STRONGER,

842
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,410
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT YOU'RE
GETTING DOWN.

843
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:02,663
YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO MAYBE WILL
NOT WIN INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.

844
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,499
THEY WANT TO MAKE THE MOST
ROBUST FOOTBALL TEAM THEY CAN

845
00:43:05,582 --> 00:43:06,041
POSSIBLY MAKE.

846
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,210
GOD LOVE THEM FOR IT.
