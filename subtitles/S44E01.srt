00:22:56,862 --> 00:22:58,172
We got this.

522
00:22:58,275 --> 00:22:59,655
MATTHEW: I stepped up

523
00:22:59,758 --> 00:23:01,655
because I'm the oldest person
on the tribe

524
00:23:01,758 --> 00:23:03,310
and the smallest guy.

525
00:23:03,413 --> 00:23:05,302
So I felt like that could put
a target on my back.

526
00:23:05,344 --> 00:23:08,793
So I needed to prove to everyone
I'm not a detriment to my tribe.

527
00:23:08,896 --> 00:23:10,310
Hey, good luck, guys.

528
00:23:10,413 --> 00:23:11,992
- Yeah, no doubt.
- BRANDON: So me and Matthew

529
00:23:12,034 --> 00:23:13,620
flipped over the four-hour timer

530
00:23:13,724 --> 00:23:14,844
and we get straight to work.

531
00:23:17,068 --> 00:23:19,724
We put the first coconut in,
drag it down.

532
00:23:19,827 --> 00:23:21,206
We're feeling great.

533
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,923
This is easy.
We're gonna push through it.

534
00:23:22,965 --> 00:23:24,445
We'll be done, probably,
in two hours.

535
00:23:32,827 --> 00:23:34,724
HELEN: Complete one
of the following tasks:

536
00:23:34,827 --> 00:23:36,482
Sweat or Savvy.

537
00:23:36,586 --> 00:23:39,137
I thought it was
already chosen. It's here...

538
00:23:39,241 --> 00:23:41,275
- The decision.
- CARSON: I'm so nervous.

539
00:23:44,448 --> 00:23:46,103
- "You are doing Savvy."
- YAM YAM: Ugh.

540
00:23:46,206 --> 00:23:48,095
HELEN: In the past when we've
seen these savvy challenges,

541
00:23:48,137 --> 00:23:50,344
they're not easy, especially
when you're trying

542
00:23:50,448 --> 00:23:51,728
to make a good first impression.

543
00:23:51,793 --> 00:23:53,448
You don't want
to let your tribe down.

544
00:23:53,551 --> 00:23:55,586
But I felt like
if there was any point

545
00:23:55,689 --> 00:23:58,310
for me to step up,
this would have been it,

546
00:23:58,413 --> 00:23:59,578
'cause I like brain teasers.
I like

547
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,000
to do puzzles in my free time.

548
00:24:01,103 --> 00:24:02,758
I can-I can do it.

549
00:24:02,862 --> 00:24:04,172
Do you guys feel like you're...

550
00:24:04,275 --> 00:24:06,206
either of you are really strong
at brain teasers?

551
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,379
- I... I'm gonna say no.
- [laughing]

552
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:11,000
I'm just gonna be real.

553
00:24:13,344 --> 00:24:15,784
I'm willing, but I don't want
to make a big mistake, or, like,

554
00:24:15,827 --> 00:24:18,379
- cause us to not...
- Here's the thing. We... - No, no.

555
00:24:18,482 --> 00:24:20,440
- I think we should just...
- All we can do is try our best. - Yeah.

556
00:24:20,482 --> 00:24:23,379
- I think I love this confidence. You're for sure in.
- Yeah.

557
00:24:23,482 --> 00:24:24,958
YAM YAM: I think we
should be okay with you guys.

558
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,551
- Okay.
- Carson, we got this.

559
00:24:26,655 --> 00:24:28,793
CARSON: Yes. I'm good
at strategy stuff and puzzles.

560
00:24:28,896 --> 00:24:30,827
However, I didn't want
to be the guy who said,

561
00:24:30,931 --> 00:24:32,164
"I'm great at puzzles.
Let me do it."

562
00:24:32,206 --> 00:24:35,103
Because I just
did not want there

563
00:24:35,206 --> 00:24:38,275
to be an unnecessary
target on my back so early on.

564
00:24:38,379 --> 00:24:39,682
So I didn't want
to choose for myself.

565
00:24:39,724 --> 00:24:41,244
I wanted the tribe
to push me in there.

566
00:24:41,344 --> 00:24:44,172
- Oh, gosh.
- Okay.

567
00:24:52,655 --> 00:24:55,034
Oh, God. I see. Okay.

568
00:24:55,137 --> 00:24:57,862
CARSON: The puzzle is just all
these rings that just start spinning,

569
00:24:57,965 --> 00:25:00,034
which made it
very difficult to count.

570
00:25:00,137 --> 00:25:01,517
Okay. So...

571
00:25:03,172 --> 00:25:05,068
- one, two...
- CARSON: Oh, that's a great idea.

572
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:07,517
HELEN: Three, four.

573
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,923
HELEN:
It was a complicated puzzle,

574
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,482
and if we fail,
that's not a good look

575
00:25:11,586 --> 00:25:14,655
in the first few hours
that we're meeting each other.

576
00:25:14,758 --> 00:25:17,724
Let's send all positive vibes
to those guys.

577
00:25:17,827 --> 00:25:19,724
- We need a machete and the flame.
- Yes.

578
00:25:19,827 --> 00:25:21,862
- Oh, my God.
- Honestly.

579
00:25:21,965 --> 00:25:23,931
Let's walk that way.
Let's see what we see.

580
00:25:24,034 --> 00:25:26,310
Yeah, we can scope out the...
Yeah.

581
00:25:26,413 --> 00:25:29,068
- It's gorgeous.
- SARAH: Hey, this was awesome.

582
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,310
[Bruce speaking indistinctly]

583
00:25:38,068 --> 00:25:39,965
Ugh!

584
00:25:42,862 --> 00:25:44,310
YAM YAM: This cage... obviously,

585
00:25:44,413 --> 00:25:46,965
it has some kind of advantage,
and we're like,

586
00:25:47,068 --> 00:25:48,413
"Oh!

587
00:25:48,517 --> 00:25:51,103
This is a new thing here."

588
00:25:51,206 --> 00:25:52,931
You just want to touch it,
though.

589
00:25:53,034 --> 00:25:54,517
I just want
to know how heavy it is.

590
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,620
[laughs, mutters]

591
00:25:55,724 --> 00:25:59,344
[laughter]

592
00:25:59,448 --> 00:26:01,413
There has to be a key somewhere

593
00:26:01,517 --> 00:26:02,820
'cause that lock
is not gonna open

594
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:04,517
with abracadabra, you know?

595
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,068
CAROLYN: Seeing what's dangling
in there, it's like,

596
00:26:07,172 --> 00:26:10,034
"Aah!" It's like this...
just something you can't get to,

597
00:26:10,137 --> 00:26:12,000
and you want it so bad.

598
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:15,758
And I'm thinking, like, all
these sick thoughts in my head.

599
00:26:15,862 --> 00:26:17,896
Like, how can I get
in there without the key?

600
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,965
And be, like, just, like,

601
00:26:20,068 --> 00:26:21,689
"Why am I thinking like that?"

602
00:26:21,793 --> 00:26:23,164
Can you imagine one day,
we're going to wake up,

603
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,137
and there's not
gonna be anything there,

604
00:26:25,241 --> 00:26:26,481
and everybody's gonna go, like,

605
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:28,551
"It's not me."

606
00:26:30,068 --> 00:26:31,827
We're basically looking

607
00:26:31,931 --> 00:26:34,172
at eight that are going,
like, kind of vertically.

608
00:26:34,275 --> 00:26:36,551
- Vertically, mm-hmm.
- And then we have one horizontal

609
00:26:36,655 --> 00:26:39,103
- around the equator, so, we're getting nine.
- Yes. Yes.

610
00:26:39,206 --> 00:26:41,758
- Nine. Mm-hmm.
- And because of...

611
00:26:41,862 --> 00:26:43,662
I think they-they look
to be exactly the same.

612
00:26:43,724 --> 00:26:45,896
They have to be the same.
Yup, it's 18.

613
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,655
CARSON: The stakes are huge.

614
00:26:47,758 --> 00:26:50,724
If we didn't have a machete,
a pot and a flint,

615
00:26:50,827 --> 00:26:52,241
I don't know
how we would survive.

616
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:55,482
- Oh, God, I'm so nervous.
- Me too.

617
00:26:57,724 --> 00:27:00,172
- Yeah!
- Aah!

618
00:27:00,275 --> 00:27:01,413
At least some kindling.

619
00:27:01,517 --> 00:27:02,889
YAM YAM:
We need... we need to, uh...

620
00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:06,034
- [distant cheering] - Yeah!
- [cheering]

621
00:27:06,137 --> 00:27:07,827
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes!

622
00:27:07,931 --> 00:27:09,440
CARSON: That team
totally gave us a gift.

623
00:27:09,482 --> 00:27:11,413
I don't know
what they were thinking.

624
00:27:11,517 --> 00:27:12,923
Did they not see
the guy with glasses

625
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,379
and that we're not that strong,

626
00:27:14,482 --> 00:27:15,820
so that probably means
that we're gonna

627
00:27:15,862 --> 00:27:17,310
make up for it
in our intelligence?

628
00:27:17,413 --> 00:27:18,820
I mean, that
should have been a given.

629
00:27:18,862 --> 00:27:20,275
You know what, guys?

630
00:27:20,379 --> 00:27:22,059
The other tribe
is still dragging coconuts.

631
00:27:22,137 --> 00:27:24,655
[laughing, cheering]

632
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,931
[laughs]

633
00:27:32,482 --> 00:27:34,275
- Damn, it's a lot of coconuts.
- Yeah.

634
00:27:36,965 --> 00:27:38,620
BRANDON: Ah.

635
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:39,896
Yeah, this is a little harder

636
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,517
than I was thinking
it was gonna be,

637
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,337
- but you know what?
- It's Survivor. Nothing's easy.

638
00:27:43,379 --> 00:27:45,241
Yeah, I already knew that,
but I'm-I'm willing

639
00:27:45,344 --> 00:27:46,724
to bet on myself every time.

640
00:27:46,827 --> 00:27:48,482
- Every single time.
- I am, too.

641
00:27:48,586 --> 00:27:51,137
- 'Cause I knew I wasn't doing the Savvy.
- No.

642
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:54,482
BRANDON:
I think we both underestimated

643
00:27:54,586 --> 00:27:56,344
how heavy
those coconuts were and

644
00:27:56,448 --> 00:27:58,965
how many coconuts there actually
were sitting on the beach.

645
00:27:59,068 --> 00:28:02,689
And around coconut 32,
we realized

646
00:28:02,793 --> 00:28:04,073
we got a challenge on our hands.

647
00:28:10,034 --> 00:28:11,820
JAIME: We should get
coconuts to crack open for them

648
00:28:11,862 --> 00:28:13,578
- when they're done.
- Oh, there's one there if you want.

649
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,130
'Cause they're bringing home
the machetes,

650
00:28:15,172 --> 00:28:16,965
we'll bring home the coconuts.

651
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:20,448
No, don't go towards it!

652
00:28:21,448 --> 00:28:23,379
KANE: Ooh.

653
00:28:23,482 --> 00:28:25,482
We make one turn,

654
00:28:25,586 --> 00:28:28,517
and there's a fricking
birdcage with, like,

655
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,310
a little bag hanging in it.

656
00:28:30,413 --> 00:28:32,793
And presumably something
of great value is in that bag.

657
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,544
Okay, so we know we're gonna
build camp over there.

658
00:28:34,586 --> 00:28:37,103
I'm real concerned about water.

659
00:28:37,206 --> 00:28:39,233
- Let's find water and head back to start camp, I think.
- Yeah.

660
00:28:39,275 --> 00:28:41,068
Are we just gonna walk away
or don't

661
00:28:41,172 --> 00:28:43,655
- want to talk about it? Like...
- KANE: I get that we

662
00:28:43,758 --> 00:28:44,992
- want this thing, but I feel like...
- MADDY: Yeah, we...

663
00:28:45,034 --> 00:28:46,482
if they come back in four hours,

664
00:28:46,586 --> 00:28:48,000
we have nothing
to show for them,

665
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:49,682
- they're gonna be pissed.
- Yeah, I agree.

666
00:28:49,724 --> 00:28:51,000
- Fine.
- KANE: Okay.

667
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,379
[grunting]

668
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:07,758
BRANDON: When there
were 20 coconuts left,

669
00:29:07,862 --> 00:29:09,475
this is where that bear jumped
on our backs.

670
00:29:09,517 --> 00:29:12,379
[panting]

671
00:29:12,482 --> 00:29:13,440
The sun is beaming on us.

672
00:29:13,482 --> 00:29:15,275
We're sweating like crazy.

673
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,896
And as we started feeling the
fatigue of it, a lot of doubt

674
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,068
started creeping in.

675
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:22,896
The danger in taking breaks is

676
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,206
that clock is running.

677
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,310
That sand is
not slowing down at all.

678
00:29:26,413 --> 00:29:29,551
[grunting]

679
00:29:29,655 --> 00:29:31,344
MATTHEW: It was

680
00:29:31,448 --> 00:29:33,241
brutal.

681
00:29:33,344 --> 00:29:35,896
At this point, we could
only do inches at a time.

682
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,551
- [grunts]
- Come on.

683
00:29:42,931 --> 00:29:44,578
MATTHEW: I was the
one that said I could do this.

684
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,827
They're gonna think that I was

685
00:29:45,931 --> 00:29:47,482
the one dragging us down,
so I had

686
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:49,551
to keep going.

687
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:52,793
[grunting]

688
00:29:52,896 --> 00:29:55,724
[groaning]

689

But I don't want
to let the game pass me by.

1031
00:44:44,827 --> 00:44:47,068
Do I wait for people
to come to me?

1032
00:44:47,172 --> 00:44:49,137
What if they never come to me?!

1033
00:44:53,655 --> 00:44:54,862
I haven't really, either.

1034
00:44:54,965 --> 00:44:57,206
The only person
I've talked to was Bruce.

1035
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:58,210
Okay, got you.

1036
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:00,551
[laughs] And so,

1037
00:45:00,655 --> 00:45:03,206
you know, you want to, like,
be in with people.

1038
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:05,103
- Yeah.
- But, like, not follow them around.

1039
00:45:05,206 --> 00:45:08,068
- Yeah.
- But nobody has come to me and been like, "Hey," you know?

1040
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:09,620
And I get good vibes from you.

1041
00:45:09,724 --> 00:45:11,578
- I think you're...
- Yeah. I think you're great.

1042
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:14,586
It's just, I'm always, like,
the weird one or the odd one.

1043
00:45:14,689 --> 00:45:15,589
- So I'm like...
- No.

1044
00:45:15,655 --> 00:45:16,827
Well, typically.

1045
00:45:16,931 --> 00:45:18,413
- [laughs]
- CAROLYN: My entire life,

1046
00:45:18,517 --> 00:45:22,068
people are constantly saying,
"Carolyn's kind of loud.

1047
00:45:22,172 --> 00:45:25,310
Carolyn's a little bit crazy.
Carolyn's a little emotional."

1048
00:45:25,413 --> 00:45:27,517
But I am
coming out here as somebody

1049
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:28,827
who loves and accepts myself.

1050
00:45:28,931 --> 00:45:30,758
[yells]

1051
00:45:30,862 --> 00:45:32,982
With the point of view
that it's okay to be different,

1052
00:45:33,034 --> 00:45:35,482
it's okay
to be a little bit loud.

1053
00:45:35,586 --> 00:45:36,486
[screams]

1054
00:45:36,586 --> 00:45:37,827
[shrieks]

1055
00:45:37,931 --> 00:45:38,965
Aah!

1056
00:45:39,068 --> 00:45:40,448
So, that's my battle right now.

1057
00:45:40,551 --> 00:45:43,034
I want to play this game
as my authentic self,

1058
00:45:43,137 --> 00:45:46,413
but I can't be too aggressive.
Maybe

1059
00:45:46,517 --> 00:45:48,034
I need to just
work on my strategy.

1060
00:45:48,137 --> 00:45:51,931
I can't be so like,
"Nobody's talking to me."

1061
00:45:52,034 --> 00:45:54,413
That's annoying. I know that.

1062
00:45:56,586 --> 00:45:58,689
YAM YAM: We have a boat, guys.

1063
00:45:58,793 --> 00:46:00,413
- What?
- Uh-oh.

1064
00:46:00,517 --> 00:46:02,241
CARSON:
I don't like this. [Laughs]

1065
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:06,275
YAM YAM: Is that for Tika?

1066
00:46:06,379 --> 00:46:07,379
Yeah.

1067
00:46:09,034 --> 00:46:10,689
CARSON: I'm nervous.

1068
00:46:10,793 --> 00:46:13,153
- SARAH: Are we ready? - HELEN: Yeah.
- CARSON: No. [Laughs]

1069
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:22,000
Then I'll just, uh,
get on my boat then.

1070
00:46:25,172 --> 00:46:26,172
SARAH: Yeah.

1071
00:46:27,793 --> 00:46:29,068
Come on down.

1072
00:46:29,172 --> 00:46:31,758
Carolyn is like,
"I'm going. I'm going."

1073
00:46:31,862 --> 00:46:34,689
And I was like, "I love you,
girl, but I want to go, too."

1074
00:46:37,931 --> 00:46:39,896
- Crazy.
- CAROLYN: Oh!

1075
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,275
I'm excited.

1076
00:46:41,379 --> 00:46:42,302
- HELEN: Yeah?
- CAROLYN: My tribe was not

1077
00:46:42,344 --> 00:46:43,586
supposed to want to go.

1078
00:46:43,689 --> 00:46:45,310
I wanted that opportunity.

1079
00:46:45,413 --> 00:46:47,551
[groans] I'm pissed.
Like, I'm not...

1080
00:46:49,551 --> 00:46:51,034
And so like, "Bye!"

1081
00:46:53,068 --> 00:46:55,758
- Rock it, Sarah!
- [whoops]

1082
00:46:57,379 --> 00:46:59,130
- MATT: All right, ready?
- HEIDI: Three, two,

1083
00:46:59,172 --> 00:47:00,448
- one.
- MATT: Go.

1084
00:47:01,413 --> 00:47:02,517
Wait.

1085
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,682
- HEIDI: No, Matt...
- MATT: Is it me?

1086
00:47:03,724 --> 00:47:04,482
- Okay.
- HEIDI: You got it, Matt.

1087
00:47:04,586 --> 00:47:06,517
- Aw...
- Aw...

1088
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:07,551
[laughs]

1089
00:47:07,655 --> 00:47:09,310
I get the short straw.

1090
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:11,827
[sighs]

1091
00:47:11,931 --> 00:47:12,965
No.

1092
00:47:14,689 --> 00:47:16,724
I do not want this to be me.

1093
00:47:16,827 --> 00:47:19,344
Leaving the tribe so early...

1094
00:47:19,448 --> 00:47:22,000
When everyone is still
forming relationships...

1095
00:47:22,103 --> 00:47:23,551
Is terrible.

1096
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:25,965
MADDY: Let's draw rocks.

1097
00:47:26,068 --> 00:47:27,103
KANE: Ready?

1098
00:47:27,206 --> 00:47:28,241
- Ratu.
- Ratu.

1099
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,344
LAUREN:
[chuckles] I picked up the rocks

1100
00:47:32,448 --> 00:47:34,000
to put in the bag,

1101
00:47:34,103 --> 00:47:37,172
so I knew
which rocks were which.

1102
00:47:37,275 --> 00:47:40,413
And so, magically,
I picked the gray rock.

1103
00:47:41,344 --> 00:47:42,413
MATTHEW: Good luck.

1104
00:47:42,517 --> 00:47:43,475
Let y'all know what happens.

1105
00:47:43,517 --> 00:47:44,724
KANE: Yeah, please do.

1106
00:47:44,827 --> 00:47:46,227
LAUREN:
If I'm gonna play this game,

1107
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:48,110
and if I'm gonna
have something to show for it

1108
00:47:48,206 --> 00:47:50,655
in the end,
I can't just be here at camp.

1109
00:47:51,689 --> 00:47:55,206
There's nothing in this game
that I'm not gonna do. I'm here

1110
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:56,689
to play Survivor.

1111
00:47:59,965 --> 00:48:01,448
KANE: Yeah.

1112
00:48:01,551 --> 00:48:03,586
Are we gonna
look for the key at all?

1113
00:48:03,689 --> 00:48:05,406
- I think we should.
- Yeah, I think we should, too.

1114
00:48:05,448 --> 00:48:07,233
Yeah, we can look
for the key now, if you want.

1115
00:48:07,275 --> 00:48:09,896
MATTHEW: Right now the cage
is on the top of everybody's mind,

1116
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,724
because inside that birdcage
is a hook with a bag on it.

1117
00:48:13,827 --> 00:48:17,310
But the cage is locked up
with this giant lock.

1118
00:48:17,413 --> 00:48:20,827
And so we all decided that we
needed to go look for that key.

1119
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:21,965
JAIME: Ready?

1120
00:48:23,931 --> 00:48:24,965
Okay.

1121
00:48:26,206 --> 00:48:29,000
MATTHEW: So I pulled a trick
out of the oldSurvivor bag and said,

1122
00:48:29,103 --> 00:48:30,448
"Let's split up
and go in groups."

1123
00:48:30,551 --> 00:48:33,827
And that way,
regardless of who found it,

1124
00:48:33,931 --> 00:48:35,931
no one can hide it from anyone.

1125
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
When I see a bag in a cage,
I think

1126
00:48:41,103 --> 00:48:42,164
there's something good in there.

1127
00:48:42,206 --> 00:48:43,413
And I don't think it's rice.

1128
00:48:44,448 --> 00:48:46,268
MADDY: What if we show up
to the challenge, and they're like,

1129
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:48,000
"There was
an advantage in the cage."

1130
00:48:48,103 --> 00:48:50,206
And it just dawned on me:
What if

1131
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:52,586
the purpose of the cage
is to cause paranoia?

1132
00:48:52,689 --> 00:48:55,137
That is the reason
the cage is there.

1133
00:48:58,034 --> 00:48:59,682
BRANDON: It's scary 'cause we
don't know what's inside that cage.

1134
00:48:59,724 --> 00:49:02,448
Hopefully there's
something that benefits us all.

1135
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,620
JAIME:
Because it's such a public cage,

1136
00:49:05,724 --> 00:49:07,689
we can see
when somebody opens it.

1137
00:49:07,793 --> 00:49:09,000
Can we, though?

1138
00:49:09,103 --> 00:49:10,793
What if somebody
found the key already?

1139
00:49:10,896 --> 00:49:13,216
I just don't want us to get
bamboozled, is what I'm saying.

1140
00:49:15,931 --> 00:49:17,103
If I find that key,

1141
00:49:17,206 --> 00:49:19,103
I'm not opening...
[chuckles] the cage.

1142
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,448
If you're a good player,
you keep it secret.

1143
00:49:25,586 --> 00:49:27,440
BRANDON: The sweat
challenge really showed me that

1144
00:49:27,482 --> 00:49:29,137
nothing on this journey
is gonna be easy.

1145
00:49:29,241 --> 00:49:32,172
My body's still exhausted,
but if you want it bad enough,

1146
00:49:32,275 --> 00:49:34,103
you're gonna
have to work for it.

1147
00:49:38,689 --> 00:49:41,034
♪ ♪

1148
00:49:41,137 --> 00:49:42,793
And I see this little package.

1149
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:44,816
Oh, my gosh. Is this the key,
or is this an idol?

1150
00:49:44,896 --> 00:49:46,406
Like, what is this?
Uh, it-it's something.

1151
00:49:46,448 --> 00:49:48,827
I'm trying to hide it
from Maddy because

1152
00:49:48,931 --> 00:49:50,931
I don't want anybody
to know that I found it.

1153
00:49:51,034 --> 00:49:53,413
So I'm trying to act cool.

1154
00:49:54,689 --> 00:49:56,586
Like nothing had happened.

1155
00:49:56,689 --> 00:49:58,137
MADDY:
Brandon does something weird,

1156
00:49:58,241 --> 00:50:00,137
and from the back,
it, like, kind of looks like

1157
00:50:00,241 --> 00:50:01,689
he, like, put something
in his pants,

1158
00:50:01,793 --> 00:50:02,862
which is odd.

1159
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,620
Maddy's very close to me,
so she can see

1160
00:50:12,724 --> 00:50:13,931
everything I'm doing.

1161
00:50:14,034 --> 00:50:15,613
My head is racing,
my adrenaline's going.

1162
00:50:15,655 --> 00:50:17,371
I'm like, "I can't believe
I just found this."

1163
00:50:17,413 --> 00:50:18,517
I'll check over here.

1164
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,206
If she saw me,

1165
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:22,199
she's gonna go tell
everybody else that I found it

1166
00:50:22,241 --> 00:50:23,521
and didn't
say anything about it.

1167
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,820
I didn't want
to build that distrust

1168
00:50:24,862 --> 00:50:26,034
with the rest of the tribe

1169
00:50:26,137 --> 00:50:27,448
so early on in the game.

1170
00:50:27,551 --> 00:50:29,586
Yo. Come here.

1171
00:50:34,206 --> 00:50:35,379
MADDY: You're kidding.

1172
00:50:48,965 --> 00:50:50,482
MADDY: Wait.

1173
00:50:54,655 --> 00:50:56,034
That's what I'm saying.

1174
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:58,896
InSurvivor,
you have to think outside

1175
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,241
of the cage.

1176
00:51:00,344 --> 00:51:02,758
Maybe the two of us open it

1177
00:51:02,862 --> 00:51:04,551
so we know what's in there.

1178
00:51:04,655 --> 00:51:05,931
And it would be good,

1179
00:51:06,034 --> 00:51:07,268
'cause then
he's more bonded to me.

1180
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:10,310
Can we play it off like...

1181
00:51:12,448 --> 00:51:14,551
- Yeah.
- BRANDON: I do want to keep it a secret,

1182
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:16,793
but the fact that
Maddy was telling me that

1183
00:51:16,896 --> 00:51:19,103
she wanted to keep it a secret
made me super nervous.

1184
00:51:19,206 --> 00:51:21,551
I just knew I can't tr...
I can't trust Maddy.

1185
00:51:21,655 --> 00:51:23,137
Yo!

1186
00:51:23,241 --> 00:51:26,206
- We found it.
- They found it.

1187
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:28,206
MADDY: In my mind, it
would have been good

1188
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:31,000
for me and Brandon to keep
the key for ourselves, but

1189
00:51:31,103 --> 00:51:32,551
sometimes you're at the mercy

1190
00:51:32,655 --> 00:51:36,137
of other people's moves
and, obviously, he doesn't

1191
00:51:36,241 --> 00:51:37,344
want to work with me.

1192
00:51:39,551 --> 00:51:40,896
[Matthew speaks indistinctly]

1193
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,172
- JAIME: Oh, my God.
- MATTHEW: Figure out what it is.

1194
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:00,517
KANE: Yeah. [Laughs]

1195
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,241
- Now, that's pretty cool.
- That was nice.

1196
00:52:03,344 --> 00:52:06,517
MATTHEW: It's not only an

strong position later on.
If I want to make it

If it's not the advantage,
you can choose to draw again,

01:14:15,586 --> 01:14:16,923
This is the only time
that we can do this.

1702
01:14:16,965 --> 01:14:19,379
We have to get Jaime,

1703
01:14:19,482 --> 01:14:21,068
and then I can talk to Kane.

1704
01:14:21,172 --> 01:14:22,923
- That's fine, but...
- I mean, I mean, I'm down

1705
01:14:22,965 --> 01:14:25,413
with whatever
is gonna benefit me.

1706
01:14:25,517 --> 01:14:26,862
My first thought process

1707
01:14:26,965 --> 01:14:29,241
was go into this Tribal
and not vote

1708
01:14:29,344 --> 01:14:31,379
because I have
the Bank Your Vote Advantage,

1709
01:14:31,482 --> 01:14:33,862
which could gain an extra vote.

1710
01:14:33,965 --> 01:14:36,931
But Maddy presented me with
the idea to vote Brandon out.

1711
01:14:37,034 --> 01:14:39,551
I do think
it could be a good idea

1712
01:14:39,655 --> 01:14:41,448
because he has an idol.

1713
01:14:43,793 --> 01:14:45,793
He's so sus.

1714
01:14:47,586 --> 01:14:49,344
And if we get him out,
we have the numbers.

1715
01:14:49,448 --> 01:14:51,168
JAIME: The guys are
saying that it's Lauren,

1716
01:14:51,241 --> 01:14:53,931
but the girls
want to go Brandon.

1717
01:14:54,034 --> 01:14:56,344
I have no idea what's going on.

1718
01:14:56,448 --> 01:14:57,889
Everybody has, like,
a major poker face.

1719
01:14:57,931 --> 01:14:59,482
See, this is what it does.

1720
01:14:59,586 --> 01:15:01,344
My mind is just
going crazy right now.

1721
01:15:01,448 --> 01:15:03,482
- Like...
- Is Brandon gonna play his idol?

1722
01:15:03,586 --> 01:15:05,095
- No.
- No. He doesn't know. He's so confident.

1723
01:15:05,137 --> 01:15:06,537
Wait. If I play
my Shot in the Dark,

1724
01:15:06,586 --> 01:15:07,827
I don't get to vote, right?

1725
01:15:07,931 --> 01:15:09,517
- Right.
- Right. Don't do it.

1726
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:11,000
LAUREN: Jaime talked about

1727
01:15:11,103 --> 01:15:13,551
playing her Shot in the Dark
just because

1728
01:15:13,655 --> 01:15:15,689
she was nervous, but it's only

1729
01:15:15,793 --> 01:15:17,931
a one in six chance
of actually being safe,

1730
01:15:18,034 --> 01:15:19,965
and if she doesn't vote,

1731
01:15:20,068 --> 01:15:22,034
that can mess it up
for us tonight.

1732
01:15:24,206 --> 01:15:26,344
- ...
- BRANDON: Jaime makes me feel nervous.

1733
01:15:26,448 --> 01:15:28,172
I'm not gonna lie.

1734
01:15:31,310 --> 01:15:33,586
- Maddy's... Maddy's sneaky.
- Yeah.

1735
01:15:33,689 --> 01:15:35,970
BRANDON: I don't trust Maddy.
She's here to play the game,

1736
01:15:36,068 --> 01:15:37,647
and there's no telling
what she would do.

1737
01:15:37,689 --> 01:15:40,655
And Jaime's running around like
a chicken with her head cut off.

1738
01:15:40,758 --> 01:15:44,413
So it's hard
to figure out who I can trust.

1739
01:15:55,689 --> 01:15:57,793
KANE: Holy smokes.
I think it's a little early

1740
01:15:57,896 --> 01:15:59,758
to take out Brandon,

1741
01:15:59,862 --> 01:16:01,896
but, hey, here's the thing.

1742
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,620
I came here to play this game.

1743
01:16:03,724 --> 01:16:05,130
Brandon has an idol.
We have to flush it out.

1744
01:16:05,172 --> 01:16:06,509
Yeah, I know.
I-I understand what's going on.

1745
01:16:06,551 --> 01:16:07,951
I'm just curious
if we have numbers.

1746
01:16:09,931 --> 01:16:11,655
Lauren and...

1747
01:16:11,758 --> 01:16:13,206
Okay.

1748
01:16:16,137 --> 01:16:18,172
Yeah.

1749
01:16:18,275 --> 01:16:20,068
I think that we can do it.

1750
01:16:20,172 --> 01:16:21,689
KANE:
If Brandon whips an idol out,

1751
01:16:21,793 --> 01:16:23,689
I do not want to be
on the wrong side of that.

1752
01:16:23,793 --> 01:16:26,551
So it's up to me to decide
what's the best way forward.

1753
01:16:30,551 --> 01:16:32,586
We have one opportunity
to flush the idol.

1754
01:16:36,931 --> 01:16:39,034
So it would be me, Jaime, Lauren

1755
01:16:39,137 --> 01:16:41,724
- and Kane.
- MATTHEW: I mean,

1756
01:16:41,827 --> 01:16:43,724
we're losing our biggest guy.

1757
01:16:46,965 --> 01:16:49,724
- Just think about it.
- Okay.

1758
01:16:49,827 --> 01:16:52,965
The big name that came up was
Brandon, which is kind of scary.

1759
01:16:53,068 --> 01:16:55,068
I mean,
he is my closest ally so far.

1760
01:16:55,172 --> 01:16:58,448
But if they have the numbers,
I don't know if I have a choice.

1761
01:16:58,551 --> 01:17:02,655
Lauren's someone
I know I cannot trust.

1762
01:17:02,758 --> 01:17:05,724
But honestly, I don't know
how much I can trust Brandon

1763
01:17:05,827 --> 01:17:07,482
versus anybody else
at this point

1764
01:17:07,586 --> 01:17:10,137
because it's only once
names get written down is that

1765
01:17:10,241 --> 01:17:11,761
we'll know
where people actually stand.

1766
01:17:11,862 --> 01:17:14,172
What's going on?

1767
01:17:14,275 --> 01:17:15,965
I need more water.

1768
01:17:16,068 --> 01:17:18,689
Everyone is concerned
about being

1769
01:17:18,793 --> 01:17:20,068
on the right side of this vote.

1770
01:17:20,172 --> 01:17:22,655
Unfortunately,
nobody really knows

1771
01:17:22,758 --> 01:17:26,241
where the right side
of the vote is gonna be.

1772
01:17:47,586 --> 01:17:49,620
♪ ♪

1773
01:17:59,793 --> 01:18:02,172
Behind each of you is a torch.
Go ahead and grab a torch,

1774
01:18:02,275 --> 01:18:04,586
dip it in and get fire.

1775
01:18:10,482 --> 01:18:11,793
This is part of the ritual

1776
01:18:11,896 --> 01:18:13,689
at Tribal Council
because in this game,

1777
01:18:13,793 --> 01:18:15,241
fire represents your life.

1778
01:18:15,344 --> 01:18:18,965
And when your fire is gone,
as you know, so are you.

1779
01:18:19,068 --> 01:18:22,275
Always tough at Tribal Council,

1780
01:18:22,379 --> 01:18:24,034
especially the first
Tribal Council.

1781
01:18:24,137 --> 01:18:27,482
So, Jaime, give me
the vibe of this six.

1782
01:18:27,586 --> 01:18:30,034
It's tense right now.
The vibe is tense.

1783
01:18:30,137 --> 01:18:33,344
You know that
choking feeling you get?

1784
01:18:33,448 --> 01:18:35,368
Like, am I the only one
that has that? Because...

1785
01:18:35,448 --> 01:18:36,758
Yeah. Yeah.

1786
01:18:36,862 --> 01:18:39,344
JAIME:
You think your mind moves fast.

1787
01:18:39,448 --> 01:18:42,724
The game moves faster,
and it is if you can keep up,

1788
01:18:42,827 --> 01:18:44,620
then you'll be here tomorrow.

1789
01:18:44,724 --> 01:18:48,000
PROBST: Matthew, do you
feel that same tension right now

1790
01:18:48,103 --> 01:18:49,482
or uncertainty?

1791
01:18:49,586 --> 01:18:51,724
Yes, absolutely.
You get back from the challenge,

1792
01:18:51,827 --> 01:18:53,026
you know you're going
to Tribal, and you know

1793
01:18:53,068 --> 01:18:54,620
that you have
to make a decision.

1794
01:18:54,724 --> 01:18:57,448
And so, it's crazy because one
name comes up, and everybody's

1795
01:18:57,551 --> 01:18:59,631
like, "Yeah, that's great.
Easy vote. We'll do that."

1796
01:18:59,689 --> 01:19:01,758
And then, another comes up.
So I don't know

1797
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:03,793
if anybody up here
is feeling comfortable.

1798
01:19:03,896 --> 01:19:06,206
- I know I'm certainly not.
- PROBST: Brandon,

1799
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:08,172
I've never seen an easy vote,

1800
01:19:08,275 --> 01:19:10,344
because there's no certainty.

1801
01:19:10,448 --> 01:19:13,344
Yeah, I mean, it seemed
like a easy vote, but

1802
01:19:13,448 --> 01:19:15,371
you don't know what people
are telling other people.

1803
01:19:15,413 --> 01:19:17,509
You don't know what is...
what is lies, what's the truth.

1804
01:19:17,551 --> 01:19:20,655
But I think that
also kind of navigates

1805
01:19:20,758 --> 01:19:24,137
the way the snake is going
and who's going to get bit.

1806
01:19:24,241 --> 01:19:26,620
Wow. Lauren,
what do you read into that?

1807
01:19:26,724 --> 01:19:28,620
Man, it makes me tense.

1808
01:19:28,724 --> 01:19:31,034
I mean, I definitely
do have alliances with a few

1809
01:19:31,137 --> 01:19:33,793
of these people here,
but to hear Brandon say that,

1810
01:19:33,896 --> 01:19:37,413
that makes me feel
a little uncertain.

1811
01:19:37,517 --> 01:19:39,827
PROBST: And that's a big
part of this game is you have

1812
01:19:39,931 --> 01:19:42,310
to decide, "I don't believe you"
or "I do believe you."

1813
01:19:42,413 --> 01:19:44,551
So, Jaime,
how much talk was there

1814
01:19:44,655 --> 01:19:48,275
amongst the group
about advantages or idols?

1815
01:19:48,379 --> 01:19:49,827
JAIME: We do have an idol

1816
01:19:49,931 --> 01:19:52,241
that we found in a birdcage
with the lock and the key.

1817
01:19:52,344 --> 01:19:54,896
Um, Brandon found it. Um...

1818
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,931
So is it Brandon's idol

1819
01:19:57,034 --> 01:19:59,068
or is it whoever needs it
can ask for it?

1820
01:19:59,172 --> 01:20:00,689
Because he found the key,

1821
01:20:00,793 --> 01:20:03,931
I think it was a tribe decision
that it would be his idol.

1822
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,137
I think it's definitely
Brandon's idol.

1823
01:20:07,241 --> 01:20:09,206
[overlapping chatter]

1824
01:20:09,310 --> 01:20:11,413
MATTHEW: For sure. But
that knowledge is power.

1825
01:20:11,517 --> 01:20:13,068
Because when you dilute

1826
01:20:13,172 --> 01:20:15,068
that information
between the entire group,

1827
01:20:15,172 --> 01:20:17,413
it reduces the amount of power
that that has,

1828
01:20:17,517 --> 01:20:19,862
versus if you don't
know about the secret,

1829
01:20:19,965 --> 01:20:21,655
that's the snake
that's gonna get you.

1830
01:20:21,758 --> 01:20:23,682
It's gonna pop out of the grass
and bite you in the leg,

1831
01:20:23,724 --> 01:20:25,586
and you're not even
gonna know it was there.

1832
01:20:25,689 --> 01:20:27,130
Let's also keep in mind
we didn't know

1833
01:20:27,172 --> 01:20:28,724
it was an immunity idol
in there.

1834
01:20:28,827 --> 01:20:29,992
- LAUREN: Right.
- BRANDON: I was trying to, you know,

1835
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:31,095
build the trust
in my tribemates,

1836
01:20:31,137 --> 01:20:32,620
and turns out it was

1837
01:20:32,724 --> 01:20:34,793
a target painted on my back,
you know?

1838
01:20:34,896 --> 01:20:36,620
PROBST: Kane, is it
possible that tonight's

1839
01:20:36,724 --> 01:20:38,965
tribal, in a way,
could be like therapy?

1840
01:20:39,068 --> 01:20:42,896
The five that go back will say,
"Okay, now we're a group."

1841
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,647
Yeah, I think it's more like
registering for, like,

1842
01:20:44,689 --> 01:20:46,310
12 months of therapy.

1843
01:20:46,413 --> 01:20:48,931
Because it's like,
I-I want to trust

1844
01:20:49,034 --> 01:20:50,655
the people that
I'm working with, but

1845
01:20:50,758 --> 01:20:53,551
that's gonna be the way to know
whether I can trust them.

1846
01:20:54,379 --> 01:20:56,862
Maddy, how will the vote
change the tribe?

1847
01:20:56,965 --> 01:21:00,448
I think it'll be the same tribe,
just stronger.

1848
01:21:00,551 --> 01:21:02,931
So, stronger by eliminating?

1849
01:21:03,034 --> 01:21:04,724
- Yeah.
- PROBST: Brandon, does that idea

1850
01:21:04,827 --> 01:21:07,034
make sense...
That you could actually be

1851
01:21:07,137 --> 01:21:08,862
- a stronger five?
- BRANDON: Yeah.

1852
01:21:08,965 --> 01:21:10,310
I mean, I think that

1853
01:21:10,413 --> 01:21:11,724
if all goes to plan, you know,

1854
01:21:11,827 --> 01:21:13,427
I think it will
make us a stronger tribe.

1855
01:21:13,482 --> 01:21:17,068
Not saying that there's
necessarily a weak link,

1856
01:21:17,172 --> 01:21:19,172
but there are weaker links.

1857
01:21:23,241 --> 01:21:24,517
PROBST: All right, so...

1858
01:21:25,551 --> 01:21:28,172
I was gonna say it's time to
vote, but you look like you have

1859
01:21:28,275 --> 01:21:30,268
- something on your mind.
- JAIME: Yeah. So, I want to be honest

1860
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:32,103
and let everybody know,

1861
01:21:32,206 --> 01:21:35,000
because it might
change the game...

1862
01:21:35,103 --> 01:21:36,655
that I'm playing
my Shot in the Dark.

1863
01:21:36,758 --> 01:21:39,275
This is a numbers game,

1864
01:21:39,379 --> 01:21:42,586
and I'm trusting everyone that
told me what they were gonna do.

1865
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:45,482
So, withholding my vote

1866
01:21:45,586 --> 01:21:47,689
does not
make a difference at all.

Wow. Brandon, when you hear

1868
01:21:49,379 --> 01:21:51,482
somebody at the first tribal

1869
01:21:51,586 --> 01:21:53,475
tell you they're gonna
play their Shot in the Dark,

1870
01:21:53,517 --> 01:21:55,862
what does it say
about this group?

1871
01:21:55,965 --> 01:21:59,517
If she's saying that
her vote wouldn't even matter,

1872
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:01,413
I'm curious
what was said to her.

1873
01:22:04,862 --> 01:22:06,206
PROBST: All right.

1874
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:09,068

Okay, here we go.

Jaime, I see you have
your scroll all ready.

1882

Bring it up.

1883
01:22:58,275 --> 01:23:00,103
Thank you.

- PROBST: Yes.

1885
01:23:10,896 --> 01:23:12,647
- You played the Shot in the Dark.
- Sure did.

1886
01:23:12,689 --> 01:23:15,172
Okay. This is Jaime's.
This is yours.

1887
01:23:18,206 --> 01:23:19,758
All right.
Just to remind everybody,

1888
01:23:19,862 --> 01:23:23,310
there are no votes in here
from Jaime or Matthew.

shot at safety tonight.

1891
01:23:28,655 --> 01:23:31,310
Matthew, if this says
you are safe,

1892
01:23:31,413 --> 01:23:33,551
then any votes cast against you
will not count.

1893
01:23:33,655 --> 01:23:34,965
Says you're not safe,

1894

Matthew, you are...

1896
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:42,931
...not safe. Any votes

1897
01:23:43,034 --> 01:23:44,551
cast against you
will still count.

1898
01:23:47,344 --> 01:23:48,620
Jaime, your Shot in the Dark...

1899
01:23:48,724 --> 01:23:51,137
Same rules... safe or not safe.

1900
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:55,655
Jaime, you are...

1901
01:23:55,758 --> 01:23:58,931
- safe.
- Oh, my God! [Sobbing]

1902
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:02,482
First time in Survivorhistory
that a player is safe

1903
01:24:02,586 --> 01:24:04,827

of using Shot in the Dark.

01:24:13,517 --> 01:24:15,172
It may be dumb.

1907
01:24:15,275 --> 01:24:18,206
I might be using this
prematurely, but this vote's

1908
01:24:18,310 --> 01:24:20,230
gonna say a lot about
what's going on in the camp

1909
01:24:20,275 --> 01:24:22,103
and who I can
and can't trust, so...

1910
01:24:22,206 --> 01:24:24,620
- It's not a secret anyways.
- PROBST: All right.

1911
01:24:26,034 --> 01:24:28,379
This is a hidden immunity idol.

You need to bring me your torch.

1940

and play really hard.
It was a great run.

1941
01:26:26,344 --> 01:26:28,241
I had a lot of fun
doing it the way I did it.

1942
01:26:28,344 --> 01:26:31,344
And I just wish I could have
done it for longer.

1943
01:26:31,448 --> 01:26:32,448
But I know I was

1944

walking a balance beam, and...

1945
