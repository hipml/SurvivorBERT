00:07:48,517 --> 00:07:51,477
These get
increasingly more difficult

170
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:53,136
because they get smaller.

171
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:55,451
So your target is tiny now
for Dwight.

172
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:57,341
JAMES: Let's go!

173
00:07:57,448 --> 00:07:58,406
PROBST:
Ryan has his two blocks.

174
00:07:58,448 --> 00:07:59,858
You're good, Coco.

175
00:07:59,965 --> 00:08:01,995
- JAMES: Let's go!
- Coco is now gonna be in it.

176
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:04,144
Come on.

177
00:08:04,241 --> 00:08:06,831
PROBST:
Oh. On and off for Dwight.

178
00:08:09,103 --> 00:08:11,553
Geo comes in for Coco.
He has the first.

179
00:08:11,655 --> 00:08:13,165
Coco's now in it.

180
00:08:14,448 --> 00:08:16,658
- Jeanine, she sticks it.
- [exclaiming]

181
00:08:16,758 --> 00:08:19,588
Baka with one,
Coco with one, Vesi with two.

182
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:20,929
All right, good job.

183
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,337
PROBST:
Dwight now feeling the pressure

184
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:23,969
of trying to win it right here.

185
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:27,451
[cheering]
- And he does it!

186
00:08:27,551 --> 00:08:30,101
Vesi wins reward!

187
00:08:30,206 --> 00:08:32,686
Ten fish

188
00:08:32,793 --> 00:08:34,903
and the opportunity
to steal one item

189
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,760
- from another tribe's camp.
- Yes! Yes!

190
00:08:37,862 --> 00:08:40,592
- [exclaiming]
- PROBST: Wow.

191
00:08:41,586 --> 00:08:44,096
All right, Vesi.

192
00:08:44,206 --> 00:08:46,756
You look
like a different tribe today.

193
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:48,452
Did you feel that, Noelle?

194
00:08:48,551 --> 00:08:50,171
Absolutely, Jeff. You know,

195
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:52,405
we woke up this morning,
we were like, "Guns blazing.

196
00:08:52,517 --> 00:08:54,657
We're tired of losing.
We want to eat."

197
00:08:54,758 --> 00:08:57,408
We literally haven't eaten
anything other than coconut.

198
00:08:57,517 --> 00:09:00,277
That's gonna change.
Ten fresh fish

199
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:02,379
delivered to your camp.

200
00:09:02,482 --> 00:09:04,452
In addition,
you have earned the right

201
00:09:04,551 --> 00:09:07,171
to go to either Baka or Coco

202
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:09,545
and take
any reward they've won...

203
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:11,095
Their fishing gear
or their tool kit.

204
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:15,243
You could also take a pot.
You could take their machete.

205
00:09:15,344 --> 00:09:17,554
The only thing off-limits
is a flint.

206
00:09:17,655 --> 00:09:19,685
The question is, which tribe
are you gonna visit?

207
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,483
And what are you gonna take?

208
00:09:21,586 --> 00:09:23,826
And we're gonna leave that
as a surprise for them.

209
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,164
Coco, Baka, got nothing for you.

210
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:27,406
Grab your stuff,
head back to camp.

00:09:36,206 --> 00:09:39,716
All right, Vesi, what goes
through your mind on day eight?

214
00:09:39,827 --> 00:09:41,687
You haven't had flint
in a long time.

215
00:09:41,793 --> 00:09:43,343
You can't take their flint.

216
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:45,378
Do you have fire at your camp?

217
00:09:45,482 --> 00:09:47,692
We do not, so, you know,
we're thinking,

218
00:09:47,793 --> 00:09:49,785
you know, we're getting
all these ten beautiful fishes,

219
00:09:49,827 --> 00:09:51,337
but how are we gonna eat 'em?

220
00:09:51,448 --> 00:09:53,278
Are we allowed to trade reward?

221
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:55,619
Absolutely. You can always trade

222
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:58,414
- for a previous reward
and give up your fish.
- NOELLE: Yeah.

223
00:09:58,517 --> 00:10:01,407
PROBST:
You still keep the camp raid.
That is a separate part.

224
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,475
- I think we should
do the tool kit...
- We could eat the fish raw.

225
00:10:03,517 --> 00:10:05,407
I'm not eating... fish raw, Cody.

226
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:07,167
- You don't eat sushi?
- [laughs]: No.

227
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:09,475
So lay it out, Noelle.
What are you gonna do?

228
00:10:09,586 --> 00:10:12,546
So we are going
to trade our reward

229
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:15,135
and get the basket of fruit
and the tool kit.

230
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:17,201
All right. You'll have
the afternoon to figure out

231
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:18,925
which tribe you're visiting

232
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:21,524
and which tribe member
is going to make the visit...

233
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,240
- Another big decision.
- NOELLE: Yeah.

234
00:10:23,344 --> 00:10:25,024
All right, Vesi,
grab your stuff, head out.

235
00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:26,509

00:10:39,034 --> 00:10:40,095
you know, I'm playing
the game of <i>Survivor.</i>

244
00:10:40,137 --> 00:10:41,717
It's a cutthroat freaking game.

245

This is the best feeling
in this world.

249
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:01,755
That was so fun.
That was so fun.

250

<i>JESSE: We've been
on a bit of a losing streak,</i>

251
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:05,934
so it's extremely important
to turn things around.

252
00:11:06,034 --> 00:11:09,104
And even though we won today,
there's no guarantees tomorrow.

253
00:11:09,206 --> 00:11:11,406
<i>And so, like, we win
this camp raid, and, like,</i>

254
00:11:11,517 --> 00:11:13,371
<i>we do have to think about what's
gonna strengthen us the most</i>

255
00:11:13,413 --> 00:11:15,213
and what's gonna
weaken the other tribe.

256
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,000
NOELLE:
Does anybody want to go?

257
00:11:18,206 --> 00:11:19,206
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

258
00:11:22,068 --> 00:11:24,718
As far as, you know, making sure
they're not pissed off.

259
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,453
Yeah.

260
00:11:27,551 --> 00:11:29,111
<i>DWIGHT: Cody's
an extremely likable guy.</i>

261
00:11:29,172 --> 00:11:30,475
He's probably gonna go over
there and make them all laugh,

262
00:11:30,517 --> 00:11:32,827
but at the same time,
this is a strategic game.

263
00:11:32,931 --> 00:11:34,371
CODY:
Yeah, I'm not
going in there, like,

264
00:11:34,413 --> 00:11:36,863
stomping out their fire
and kicking over their fort.

265
00:11:36,965 --> 00:11:39,475
"Aah!" [laughs]

266
00:11:39,586 --> 00:11:41,446
- Oh, God. <i>
- DWIGHT: Sending Cody is truly</i>

267
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:43,001
just a wild card move.

268
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:44,889
We don't know what he's
gonna do, what he's gonna say.

269

<i>- That's very scary.</i>
- [laughs]

270
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,790
NOELLE:
All right,
who are we going after?

271
00:11:48,896 --> 00:11:52,096
What if we go to the yellow
tribe and take the fishing line,

272
00:11:52,206 --> 00:11:53,516
two spearguns, two goggles.

273
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,830
Like, a full fishing set.

274
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:56,371
If we're trying
to strengthen our tribe,

275
00:11:56,413 --> 00:11:58,173
that's gonna strengthen
our tribe the most.

276
00:11:59,275 --> 00:12:01,615
<i>SAMI: Honestly, I think they'd
be stupid to not come here.</i>

277
00:12:01,724 --> 00:12:03,244
We have the most stuff.

278
00:12:03,344 --> 00:12:06,144
- Yeah.
- But they got
to look at the numbers, too.

279
00:12:06,241 --> 00:12:10,101
Coco's strong. They're-they're
still their original six.

280
00:12:10,206 --> 00:12:12,546
<i>RYAN: I think they're
smart enough to go for Baka.</i>

281
00:12:12,655 --> 00:12:13,965
<i>I really hope they are.</i>

282
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:16,968
Baka has bigger fishing gear,
bigger tool kit.

283
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:19,061
So I don't think we have
to worry about it anyway...

284
00:12:19,103 --> 00:12:20,943
<i>GEO: I don't think
Vesi's gonna come after Coco</i>

285
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:23,284
because right now
they're hurting.

286
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:25,069
<i>They haven't been eating.</i>

287
00:12:25,172 --> 00:12:27,482
<i>And Baka has the big
fishing gear... bigger than ours.</i>

288
00:12:27,586 --> 00:12:29,026
<i>But at the same time,</i>

289
00:12:29,137 --> 00:12:30,497
this is
a very scary moment for us,

290
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:31,958
because it's the first time
that we lose,

291
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,140
<i>actually.
We've never lost before.</i>

292
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:35,682
<i>JESSE:
If we're gonna piss off anybody,</i>

293
00:12:35,724 --> 00:12:36,958
<i>I feel like we should
just piss off Coco.</i>

294
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,958
NOELLE:
Because they have six people.

295
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,210
CODY:
It's five and six,

296
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,889
so it's not like
they have a huge advantage.

297
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:42,440
If we go to Coco, would you
want to take the fishing gear?

298
00:12:42,482 --> 00:12:43,785
- Machete would be...
- NOELLE: Fishing gear.

299
00:12:43,827 --> 00:12:45,233
I mean, can you imagine
without a machete?

300
00:12:45,275 --> 00:12:46,923
- NOELLE: Fishing gear.
- You can't cut c-coconuts.

301
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:48,958
- You can't start a fire.
- NOELLE: I know,
but if we win tomorrow,

302
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,590
we get our flint back,
we go fishing. That's fuel.

303
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:55,479
If this was old Jesse,
growing up as a teenager,

304
00:12:55,586 --> 00:12:58,166
like, in L.A., you know,
tattoo on my face,

305
00:12:58,275 --> 00:12:59,785
<i>I'd probably go for the jugular,</i>

306
00:12:59,896 --> 00:13:01,276
<i>be with Cody
and take the machete.</i>

307
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:03,139
- Show no mercy.
- NOELLE: Listen...

308
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,621
But I live on a cul-de-sac now.

309
00:13:04,724 --> 00:13:06,199
I, you know, I got to be
diplomatic with my neighbors.

310
00:13:06,241 --> 00:13:08,761
<i>And so, myself,
Noelle and Dwight are</i>

311
00:13:08,862 --> 00:13:10,412
<i>against hitting the other tribes</i>

312
00:13:10,517 --> 00:13:11,827
as hard as possible.

313
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:13,731
And I don't think
anybody would do that to us.

314
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:16,553
You know?

315
00:13:16,655 --> 00:13:19,095
Can we start the flint
with the saw?

316
00:13:19,206 --> 00:13:20,682
GABLER:
Well, you know,
maybe the back of it.

317
00:13:20,724 --> 00:13:22,164
ELIE:
Try it with
the front of the saw.

318
00:13:22,206 --> 00:13:23,106
It's not great.

319
00:13:23,206 --> 00:13:24,516
What I'm most worried about

320
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,590
is them taking
our pot and our machete, okay?

321
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:28,233
If they really want
to play games, do that,

322
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:29,545
then it's just war.

323
00:13:29,655 --> 00:13:31,405
We're at war, man.

324
00:13:31,517 --> 00:13:34,927
The idea of wiping a tribe out
with the take of a machete.

325
00:13:35,034 --> 00:13:36,724
You got to think long-term,
not short-term.

326
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,302
<i>CODY:
This tribe's missing some grit.</i>

327
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:43,475
<i>For me, it's not
about what we're getting,</i>

328
00:13:43,517 --> 00:13:44,475
<i>it's what we're inflicting,</i>

329
00:13:44,517 --> 00:13:45,797
<i>because we have a tribe of four,</i>

330
00:13:45,896 --> 00:13:47,336
and they're
a tribe of six and five.

331
00:13:47,448 --> 00:13:49,788
<i>We are outnumbered.
We're tired, we're beat up.</i>

332
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:52,336
I don't agree with this. I think
we're being soft as hell.

333
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:54,828
The only way
that we can close that gap

334
00:13:54,931 --> 00:13:56,411
is to kick 'em
in the shins, man.

00:13:56,517 --> 00:13:57,857
<i>Really hit 'em hard.</i>

336
00:13:57,965 --> 00:13:59,275
God.

337
00:14:01,068 --> 00:14:02,718
Sending a child off to school,

338
00:14:02,827 --> 00:14:04,517

how he's gonna behave.

339
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,520
Yeah! [laughs]

- No. No, no, no.
- OWEN: No.

342
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,547
For real?

343
00:14:17,965 --> 00:14:20,095
- Do you see that? <i>
- CODY: I might go over there
and take their machete,</i>

344
00:14:20,137 --> 00:14:22,440

- RYAN: Oh, no.

348
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,693
No, y'all.

349
00:14:32,793 --> 00:14:34,113
CASSIDY:
So they're coming for us?

350
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,236
- KARLA: Yup.
- RYAN: They really came for us.

351
00:14:36,344 --> 00:14:37,834
Put my shoes back on.

352
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:40,031
- I had just gotten comfortable.
- KARLA: Oh, my God.

353
00:14:40,137 --> 00:14:41,682

- KARLA: What's up, man?
- CASSIDY: We don't

354
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:43,934
have anything. I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to go back.

355
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:45,314
<i>We were hoping they would</i>

356
00:14:45,413 --> 00:14:47,483

00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:48,786
winning all the big rewards.

358
00:14:48,896 --> 00:14:50,696
- Cody. My pleasure.
- Nice to meet you, Cody.

359
00:14:50,793 --> 00:14:52,213
- [laughter]
- Nice to meet you.

360
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,970
So when they come to our camp,
I'm just thinking, like,

361
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:56,164
<i>we still have
six people in this game,</i>

362
00:14:56,206 --> 00:14:57,166
<i>they're down to four.</i>

363
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:59,165
<i>So they really want to give us,</i>

364
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:00,855
like, a hard blow, I guess,

365
00:15:00,965 --> 00:15:03,025
just because
we have the numbers right now.

366
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:04,477
This is pretty sweet.

367
00:15:04,586 --> 00:15:05,716
- [chuckles]
- Thanks. Take a look.

368
00:15:05,758 --> 00:15:07,208
Yeah, you're
more than welcome...

369
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,647
Yeah, I actually came over here
to kick down the post,

370
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:09,785
- to kick it over.
- [laughter]

371
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:11,027
That's what he was stealing,

372
00:15:11,137 --> 00:15:12,897
- the structure of our home.
- [grunting]

373
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,030
Oh, yeah, very nice.

374
00:15:15,137 --> 00:15:16,137
Nice work.

375
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:18,613
- Sure.
- CASSIDY: So how are
y'all eating your fish?

376
00:15:18,655 --> 00:15:20,515
Are y'all doing,
like, sashimi, or...?

377
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,310
[laughter]

378
00:15:22,413 --> 00:15:24,173
Ah, very funny.

379
00:15:25,448 --> 00:15:26,618
What are you here for?

380
00:15:26,724 --> 00:15:29,074
I, okay, so,
I came over to steal...

381
00:15:29,172 --> 00:15:30,662
I came over
to steal your machete.

382
00:15:31,724 --> 00:15:33,509
- And...
- What good does
an extra machete do for you?

383
00:15:33,551 --> 00:15:36,451
- It's-it's-it's a savage take.
I agree with you 100%.
- Okay.

384
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:39,281
But you also understand the
message that it's sending to us,

385
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:41,899
and what we're prepared
to do in retaliation.

386
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,970
<i>JAMES:
Right now, I just don't
want to lose the machete.</i>

387
00:15:45,068 --> 00:15:46,688
<i>It's one of our
most useful tools.</i>

388
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:50,243
So anything that we can do
to make Cody happy

389
00:15:50,344 --> 00:15:51,974
<i>- makes sense.</i>
- I'm not the strategist

390
00:15:52,068 --> 00:15:53,785
of the group. I'm the,
I'm, like, the messenger here.

391
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,613
JAMES:
So if you came back with, like,
some food, would that,

392
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:56,855
would-would that be enough?

393
00:15:58,172 --> 00:15:59,862
KARLA:
Yeah.

394
00:15:59,965 --> 00:16:01,375
<i>CODY:
I've done sales for 13 years,</i>

395
00:16:01,482 --> 00:16:02,854
and you don't
come into a negotiation

396
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:03,966
asking for what you want.

397
00:16:04,068 --> 00:16:05,658
<i>That's Sales 101.</i>

398
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:08,718
<i>So I told them I wanted their
machete. They didn't like that.</i>

399
00:16:08,827 --> 00:16:11,827
They started mumbling.
None of 'em knew what to do.

400
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:13,785
<i>They were kind of like, "Well,
what else would you like?"</i>

401
00:16:13,827 --> 00:16:15,927
<i>It was music to my ears.
At that point,</i>

402
00:16:16,034 --> 00:16:17,904
you know,
I was in the driver's seat.

403
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,509
So you're saying,
in lieu of the machete,

404
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:20,551
you'll give me some food?

405
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,070
- RYAN: Yeah.
- KARLA: A lot.

406
00:16:23,172 --> 00:16:24,692
- What?
- At least.
- Yes.

407
00:16:25,896 --> 00:16:27,061
- CODY: What?
- Yeah, we got limes.

408
00:16:27,103 --> 00:16:28,371
- [overlapping chatter]
- Limes are great.

409
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:29,973
Let me see
your refrigerator, man.

410
00:16:30,068 --> 00:16:32,548
- Look at this.
- Tastes like mashed potatoes.

411
00:16:32,655 --> 00:16:33,925
RYAN:
Boil it up, it's good.

412
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:36,515
Listen,
I mean, it's a good offer,

413
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,900
and I really appreciate it,

414
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,751
but the thing is,
we don't have fire right now.

415
00:16:39,793 --> 00:16:41,313
So it does us no good tonight.

416
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:44,343
We need something that will
give us a longer life cycle.

417
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,030
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

418
00:16:49,034 --> 00:16:51,104
What if we take, would you
give us the fishing gear

419
00:16:51,206 --> 00:16:53,136
and a little bit of that?

420
00:16:53,241 --> 00:16:55,971
What do you guys think?
It's a group decision.

421
00:16:56,068 --> 00:16:57,751

- JAMES: I'm down for that.
- OTHERS: Yeah.

422
00:16:57,793 --> 00:16:59,785
And some limes. Can I get
a couple limes? 'Cause, man...

423
00:16:59,827 --> 00:17:01,997
- Yeah. All right, yeah.
- Please.

424
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:05,072
Let me guess,
you got tequila back there, too?

425

00:20:35,758 --> 00:20:37,658
- Go. Go.
- PROBST: It is Vesi in the lead.

499
00:20:37,758 --> 00:20:40,138
- You got it.
- Ryan still struggling

500
00:20:40,241 --> 00:20:41,591
to get the net unlocked.

501
00:20:41,689 --> 00:20:44,449
- There we go.
- PROBST: You got it. Go, Coco.

502
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:46,141
CASSIDY:
Let's go, guys! Hell yeah!

503
00:20:46,241 --> 00:20:47,861
- Go.
- JEANINE: You got this, Baka.

504
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:50,405
It's gonna be Cody
through with the first piece.

505
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:52,547
[grunts]

506
00:20:52,655 --> 00:20:54,255
- Here comes Baka.
- OWEN: Come on, baby.

507
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,000
PROBST:
Sami's got one. Owen's got one.

508
00:20:56,103 --> 00:20:58,003
JEANINE:
Come on, Baka! Go!

509
00:20:58,103 --> 00:20:59,923
- Lindsay's got one for Coco.
- CASSIDY: Good job, Lindsay!

510
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:01,475
PROBST:
There goes Karla digging.

511
00:21:01,586 --> 00:21:02,786
Ryan just holding that net up,

512
00:21:02,896 --> 00:21:04,546
but he's not
grabbing a puzzle piece.

513
00:21:04,655 --> 00:21:06,655
You got to get
all four of 'em back here.

514
00:21:06,758 --> 00:21:07,998
[breathing heavily]

515
00:21:08,103 --> 00:21:10,343
Everybody working.
Lindsay takes a fall.

516
00:21:10,448 --> 00:21:11,658
Yes! Yes! Yes!

517
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:14,622
PROBST:
Baka, you're good.

518
00:21:14,724 --> 00:21:16,554
- Start untying.
- JEANINE: Let's go!

519
00:21:16,655 --> 00:21:18,440
- PROBST: Now you've
got to untie your bag.
- Let's go!

520
00:21:18,482 --> 00:21:21,102
Vesi has all four puzzle pieces.
Start untying.

521
00:21:21,206 --> 00:21:22,406
CASSIDY:
Yeah! Good job, Coco!

522
00:21:22,517 --> 00:21:24,587
Coco, you're good.
You can untie.

523
00:21:24,689 --> 00:21:26,406
- JEANINE: You got this, Baka!
- GEO: Go, guys!

524
00:21:26,448 --> 00:21:28,688
PROBST:
Everybody got through
that first leg very quickly.

525
00:21:28,793 --> 00:21:31,903
- [grunts]
- Now you've got to get the
puzzle pieces out of their bags.

526
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,140
Then two players
will form a square.

527
00:21:35,241 --> 00:21:38,001
Got to get 'em all out
before you can start solving.

528
00:21:39,413 --> 00:21:41,793
Dwight is moving about
as slow as you can move

529
00:21:41,896 --> 00:21:43,656
and still actually be moving.

530
00:21:43,758 --> 00:21:45,448
Thank you, Jeffrey.

531
00:21:47,586 --> 00:21:48,926
PROBST:
Baka can start solving.

532
00:21:49,034 --> 00:21:50,406
JEANINE:
You got it, you got it,
you got it.

533
00:21:50,448 --> 00:21:51,923
PROBST:
Coco, you're good.
Start solving.

534
00:21:51,965 --> 00:21:53,475
CASSIDY:
Go, Coco!

535
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,970
Vesi has their fourth.
You're good.

536
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,758
This challenge is on.

537
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:01,742
GABLER:
Towards Owen, towards Owen,
towards Owen.

538
00:22:01,827 --> 00:22:05,307
You're solving on that platform.
You're making a square.

539
00:22:05,413 --> 00:22:08,033
Yep. Just like that.
And then put, um, rotate it.

540
00:22:08,137 --> 00:22:10,757
PROBST:
You're experimenting right now
to see what works.

541
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:13,172
Up straight. There you go.

542
00:22:13,275 --> 00:22:14,785
- How's that looking there?
- No.

543
00:22:14,896 --> 00:22:16,406
- Shoot, I'm sorry.
- No.

544
00:22:16,517 --> 00:22:19,757
There you go. That's it.
That's it. That's it.

545
00:22:19,862 --> 00:22:20,902
[shushing]

546
00:22:22,344 --> 00:22:24,974
PROBST:
Trial and error.
Just keep digging.

547
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:28,719
JEANINE:
You got it, Baka.

548
00:22:28,827 --> 00:22:30,440
PROBST: Once you have it,
let me know.
- Jeff.

549
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,832
Baka thinks they have it,
and they do.

550
00:22:32,931 --> 00:22:34,481
- That's a square.
- Can we kick it?

551
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:36,206
Move up the cargo net.

552
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,760
Hell yeah, Baka!

553
00:22:37,862 --> 00:22:40,832
Baka quickly knocked it down
so nobody could even look.

554
00:22:40,931 --> 00:22:43,381
Now you've got to get very heavy

555
00:22:43,482 --> 00:22:46,282
puzzle pieces up this cargo net.

556
00:22:46,379 --> 00:22:49,929
You earn it every single day
out here on <i>Survivor.</i>

557
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:51,034
Yes.

558
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:55,480
PROBST:
It is Coco and Vesi right now,
trying to get the square.

559
00:22:55,586 --> 00:22:57,336
- Put that there!
- Go!

560
00:22:57,448 --> 00:22:59,098
Sami heading up for Baka.

561
00:22:59,206 --> 00:23:01,236
Gabler with the first piece.

562
00:23:01,344 --> 00:23:03,764
- [grunts]
- You got bodies underneath.

563
00:23:03,862 --> 00:23:05,412
If you drop a piece,
they are heavy.

564
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,277
Send it here,
then knock it over.

565
00:23:07,379 --> 00:23:09,509
- That's the way you do it, Baka.
- NOELLE: Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff!

566
00:23:09,551 --> 00:23:12,481
Vesi thinks they have it,
and they do. That's good.

567
00:23:12,586 --> 00:23:15,306
- Head up.
- CODY: Get on up there.
- JEANINE: You got this, Baka!

568
00:23:16,965 --> 00:23:18,305
Get those pieces up there!

569
00:23:18,413 --> 00:23:19,854
CODY:
Go ahead, Jesse.
Keep going, Jesse.

570
00:23:19,896 --> 00:23:20,926
Vesi now heading up.

571
00:23:22,413 --> 00:23:23,413
DWIGHT:
Oh.

572
00:23:27,068 --> 00:23:29,068
PROBST:
Coco in dead last again.

573
00:23:29,172 --> 00:23:31,312
That piece, that piece
goes down on the ground.

574
00:23:31,413 --> 00:23:34,173
RYAN:
They had it to where
it lined up like this.

575
00:23:34,275 --> 00:23:36,095
- Elie, give me your hand.
- Thank you.

576
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,826
- Wait, wait, ow!
- Oh, sorry. Sorry.

577
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:40,381
Baka, you're good. Start.

578
00:23:40,482 --> 00:23:41,592
All you, Baka!

579
00:23:41,689 --> 00:23:43,549
NOELLE:
Help Dwight. Help Dwight.

580
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,445
- I'm fine.
- All right.

581
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:47,544
- PROBST: Vesi has their four.
You're good.
- Nice, Dwight.

582
00:23:47,586 --> 00:23:51,236
We're looking for two to finish
by building a triangle.

583
00:23:51,344 --> 00:23:52,384
Flip that.

584
00:23:52,482 --> 00:23:53,509
PROBST:
It is Jesse and Dwight...

585
00:23:53,551 --> 00:23:54,451
One more time.

586
00:23:54,551 --> 00:23:56,071
...Sami and Owen.

587
00:23:56,172 --> 00:23:59,622
Immunity on the line.
Day nine, <i>Survivor 43.</i>

588
00:23:59,724 --> 00:24:03,214
Coco's still working on their
first puzzle... the square.

589
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,070
- Don't give up, Coco!
- Don't give up, Coco!

590
00:24:05,689 --> 00:24:06,859
Jeff, we got it.

591
00:24:06,965 --> 00:24:09,855
- Jeff! Jeff!
- You got it! Go, Coco!

592
00:24:09,965 --> 00:24:11,685
CASSIDY:
Right on! Good job, Coco!

593
00:24:13,206 --> 00:24:15,686
- Coco trying to stay in this.
- CASSIDY: Go, Coco!

594
00:24:15,793 --> 00:24:19,343
PROBST:
Coco, once again, has put
themselves back in competition.

595
00:24:23,137 --> 00:24:24,137
RYAN:
Watch out.

596
00:24:26,172 --> 00:24:28,762
There it is, all four pieces.
Now get up.

597
00:24:28,862 --> 00:24:31,722
James, Ryan, everybody's in it.

598
00:24:31,827 --> 00:24:34,687
- Coco, once again,
not giving up.
- Here.

599
00:24:34,793 --> 00:24:35,933
Good.

600
00:24:36,034 --> 00:24:37,554
ELIE: This one's bottom left, quickly.

601
00:24:37,655 --> 00:24:38,682
- Quickly.
- No. No, that's not it.

602
00:24:38,724 --> 00:24:39,964
It can't be it. It can't be it.

603
00:24:41,965 --> 00:24:43,405
Do not get sassy.

604
00:24:43,517 --> 00:24:44,897
I want you
to take that next piece.

605
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,590
Coco is making fast work
of this, if they can solve it.

606
00:24:48,689 --> 00:24:51,169
- Ryan, keep that up there.
Ryan, slide that in.
- Ryan, Ryan...

607
00:24:51,275 --> 00:24:52,895
PROBST:
Like so many <i>Survivor</i> puzzles,

608
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,410
once you see it,
it'll be so clear.

609
00:24:57,482 --> 00:25:00,452
But until you see it,
it's very difficult.

610
00:25:03,517 --> 00:25:05,097
[indistinct chatter]

611
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:08,336
[excited chatter]

612
00:25:08,448 --> 00:25:10,248
- Vesi has it.
Vesi wins immunity.
- [cheering]

613
00:25:11,724 --> 00:25:14,004
Vesi has won
their first immunity challenge.

614
00:25:14,103 --> 00:25:15,243
No Tribal Council.

615
00:25:16,793 --> 00:25:19,903
It is now Baka and Coco
fighting to stay alive.

616
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,170
Right there.

617
00:25:21,275 --> 00:25:22,875
- No, no, no.
- Long piece, long piece...

618
00:25:24,413 --> 00:25:27,173
Can Baka pull it out
and send Coco to Tribal Council?

619
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,515
Elie, Elie, Elie.

620
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:31,236
Have him switch that over here.

621
00:25:31,344 --> 00:25:32,785
DWIGHT:
The longest side on the ground.

622
00:25:32,827 --> 00:25:34,897
- That's the right... Flip it.
- Flip.
- Yes?

623
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,930
NOELLE:
Push that in. It'll go.

624
00:25:37,034 --> 00:25:38,144
- Yeah.
- There you go.

625
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:40,791
Vesi is very clearly
helping Baka,

626
00:25:40,896 --> 00:25:42,656
trying to tell them
where their pieces go.

627
00:25:42,758 --> 00:25:44,478
- Why?
- They're helping them?

628
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:46,136
- Yup. Yes.
- Oh, yeah.

629
00:25:46,241 --> 00:25:47,613
- Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
- JEANINE: Come on, Baka!

630
00:25:47,655 --> 00:25:49,065
- That's it.
- Spin yours.

631
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,522
Try it. We're gonna lose. Go.

632
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,716
- Keep going. Keep going...
- PROBST: Owen gonna
try a different piece.

633
00:25:53,758 --> 00:25:55,688
- DWIGHT: Yeah.
- PROBST: Do they have it?

634
00:25:55,793 --> 00:25:57,723
- There we go.
- Jeff! Jeff!

635
00:25:57,827 --> 00:25:59,337
They do! Baka has it!

636
00:25:59,448 --> 00:26:01,548
- [cheering]
- Baka pulls it out!

637
00:26:01,655 --> 00:26:03,095
[squeals]

638
00:26:03,206 --> 00:26:05,826
[whooping, cheering]

639
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,281
PROBST:
Baka safe, sending Coco
to Tribal Council

640
00:26:08,379 --> 00:26:10,209
for the first time this season.

641
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,340
- SAMI: Nice!
- PROBST: Wow, what an effort.

642
00:26:14,551 --> 00:26:19,341
A very clear division,
with Vesi helping Baka.

643
00:26:21,137 --> 00:26:23,167
Vesi, congratulations.

644
00:26:23,275 --> 00:26:24,175
[exclaims]

645
00:26:24,275 --> 00:26:25,755
First time you've had this.

646
00:26:25,862 --> 00:26:27,412
Here's your flint.

647
00:26:27,517 --> 00:26:29,067
Well-earned.

648
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:31,592
First time in a while we will
not see each other at Tribal.

649
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:34,969
Baka, hard-fought,
very close at the end.

650
00:26:35,068 --> 00:26:36,788
Baka's safe.

651
00:26:37,827 --> 00:26:40,827
Baka, Vesi, grab your stuff,
head out, enjoy the night off.

652
00:26:40,931 --> 00:26:42,791
- Thank you, sir.
- Thanks, Jeff.

653
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:50,552
Cassidy,
what do you make of the fact

654
00:26:50,655 --> 00:26:53,755
that Vesi wasn't even hiding
that they were helping Baka?

655
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,982
I mean, there isn't any rules
in the game of <i>Survivor.</i>

656
00:26:56,034 --> 00:26:58,199
There's definitely dirty play
that goes on, as we saw here.

657
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,101
They're uniting together
as the losers.

658
00:27:00,206 --> 00:27:01,546
Um, we haven't lost yet,

659
00:27:01,655 --> 00:27:03,335
and so they're trying
to just knock us down

660
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,333
- off of our pedestal.
- PROBST: All right, Coco,

661
00:27:05,379 --> 00:27:06,659
Tribal Council tonight.

662

from nine days of hard work,
trying to get along?

858
00:35:52,689 --> 00:35:54,759

Coco has gotten

859
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:56,902
as much juice out

And then today happened.

So, um, today was definitely
a wake-up call for us.

864
00:36:08,655 --> 00:36:11,205
Immediately, everyone started
breaking out into groups.

865
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:13,550
Some people spoke
a little bit more than others.

866
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:14,995
Some people didn't speak at all.

867
00:36:15,103 --> 00:36:17,863
Um, I'm curious to see
if those people

868
00:36:17,965 --> 00:36:20,065
will reveal themselves
and maybe explain why

869
00:36:20,172 --> 00:36:22,142

they needed to have

870
00:36:22,241 --> 00:36:24,311
a conversation with me tonight.

871
00:36:27,344 --> 00:36:28,834
I actually

872
00:36:28,931 --> 00:36:30,971
didn't get that energy
of, "I need to talk to you.

873
00:36:31,068 --> 00:36:32,548
Like, I want
to strategize with you."

874
00:36:32,655 --> 00:36:34,995
How do you receive that?

875
00:36:35,103 --> 00:36:37,483
I think the people that wanted
to have conversations

876
00:36:37,586 --> 00:36:40,066
with me today
made it a priority.

877
00:36:40,172 --> 00:36:43,552
- Okay, so that's a rejection.

878

or does that make you happy

881
00:36:51,344 --> 00:36:55,034
As long as the vote

00:36:55,137 --> 00:36:57,967
But I've been nervous
all afternoon.

883
00:36:58,068 --> 00:37:00,998

00:37:01,103 --> 00:37:02,933
and you get in trouble
with your parents,

885
00:37:03,034 --> 00:37:05,034
and they take the TV away
from me? It's like

886
00:37:05,137 --> 00:37:07,477

is the flint. [laughs]

and now you all have to

889
00:37:12,379 --> 00:37:14,479
come in here
and get a lecture from me.

890
00:37:14,586 --> 00:37:16,446
- [laughter]
- Why am I always the parent?

891
00:37:16,551 --> 00:37:18,621
I don't know,
but that's how I feel right now,

892
00:37:18,724 --> 00:37:21,244
and I've been nervous all night.
And if you're not nervous

893
00:37:21,344 --> 00:37:23,594
on Tribal Council,
then something's wrong with you.

894
00:37:23,689 --> 00:37:26,029
PROBST:
Karla,
what did you notice happening

895
00:37:26,137 --> 00:37:28,757
when you all got back to camp
after the challenge?

896
00:37:28,862 --> 00:37:30,242
Naturally, there was a scramble,

897
00:37:30,344 --> 00:37:32,384
and you're kind of
fact-checking.

898
00:37:32,482 --> 00:37:33,902
You kind of have
to do full circle

899
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,620
to ensure
that every single person

900
00:37:35,724 --> 00:37:37,624
that you said
you're solid with is solid.

901
00:37:37,724 --> 00:37:41,214
If not, then you have to figure
out where did that go wrong, or,

902
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:43,030
if you're solid, you're solid.

903
00:37:43,137 --> 00:37:45,787
Lindsay, fact-checking in
a conversation is a great part

904
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:47,236
- of playing <i>Survivor.</i>
- Right.

905
00:37:47,344 --> 00:37:49,244
Were you doing that today?

906
00:37:49,344 --> 00:37:51,794
Uh, probably a little too much.

907
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:54,276
I was definitely
getting paranoid,

908
00:37:54,379 --> 00:37:55,829
and everyone
definitely noticed that.

909
00:37:55,931 --> 00:37:57,901
But then I realized. "Wait.

910
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,450
"If you keep revisiting
these conversations,

911
00:38:00,551 --> 00:38:01,992
- Mm-hmm.
- "it's gonna create paranoia

912
00:38:02,034 --> 00:38:04,144
"within the people
that you just solidified

913
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:06,141
your-your votes with."

914
00:38:06,241 --> 00:38:09,481
PROBST:
So, Geo, given that you felt

915
00:38:09,586 --> 00:38:10,992
your own version of paranoia...
That the parents were mad

916
00:38:11,034 --> 00:38:12,344
and they're gonna
take the remote

917
00:38:12,448 --> 00:38:14,688
and all that stuff...
When you sense

918
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:17,933
Lindsay spiraling a little bit,
do you go in to try to help?

919
00:38:18,034 --> 00:38:20,794
I just want to make sure
I keep my people calm.

920
00:38:20,896 --> 00:38:22,716
You know, the people
that I spoke to, calm,

921
00:38:22,827 --> 00:38:24,377
so that way,
they won't freak out.

922
00:38:24,482 --> 00:38:26,792
But sometimes the waters
might look calm on the surface,

923
00:38:26,896 --> 00:38:29,406
but underneath, like, there's
stuff happening, you know?

924
00:38:29,517 --> 00:38:32,337
And it's-it's... it's gonna
get messy no matter what.

925
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:35,658
Well, I know somebody's going to
be hurt at the end of the day.

926
00:38:35,758 --> 00:38:38,968
- It's part of the game.
- James, what were you trying

927
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:40,478
to accomplish this afternoon?

928
00:38:40,586 --> 00:38:42,616
Well, I was chilling at camp
for a lot of the time.

929
00:38:42,724 --> 00:38:45,174
That's my calm demeanor,
and that's how

930
00:38:45,275 --> 00:38:47,205
I assure the people
that you're working with

931
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:50,520
that you're going to do what
you said you're going to do.

932
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,620
PROBST:
That's an interesting approach.

933
00:38:52,724 --> 00:38:54,554
"I'm just gonna chill.

934
00:38:54,655 --> 00:38:56,095
That's how I'm gonna
show you trust."

935
00:38:56,172 --> 00:38:58,692
But that's the part of this game
that's so complicated,

936
00:38:58,793 --> 00:39:00,453
which is,
"Of course I'm gonna front

937
00:39:00,551 --> 00:39:03,001
-"like I trust everybody,
but inside,
- Yeah.

938
00:39:03,103 --> 00:39:04,723
My heart is like,
'What if I'm the one?'"

939
00:39:04,827 --> 00:39:06,827
Yeah. I mean, yeah,
that's a real

00:39:06,931 --> 00:39:08,621
emotional battle
that you have to face

941
00:39:08,724 --> 00:39:11,524
because things can change every
day, every second in this game.

942
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,900
And the only way that you can
really demonstrate trust

943
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,280
is by voting.

- Agreed.
- We didn't get to finish.

950

stop talking, yeah.

to play this game,</i>

992
00:42:35,551 --> 00:42:37,281
<i>and I wasn't going
to do it half-assed.</i>

993
00:42:37,379 --> 00:42:39,139
<i>[crying]:
I'm really proud of myself.</i>

994
00:42:39,241 --> 00:42:41,661
<i>But it was everything
that I wanted it to be.</i>

995
00:42:41,758 --> 00:42:42,758
<i>Not as long,</i>

996
00:42:42,862 --> 00:42:43,972
but I'm really happy.
