00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:05,088
JEFF PROBST:
<i>16 Americans marooned</i>
<i>for 39 days</i>

2
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:07,716
<i>in the middle</i>
<i>of the South China Sea.</i>

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,261
<i>Separated into two tribes,</i>
<i>Tagi and Pagong,</i>

4
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:14,597
<i>they competed against each</i>
<i>other to remain on the island,</i>

5
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,474
<i>but now the tribes</i>
<i>have merged into one.</i>

6
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,309
<i>Rattana is the name,</i>

7
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,311
<i>and it is everyone</i>
<i>for themselves.</i>

8
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,938
<i>Every third night,</i>

9
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:24,607
<i>the entire tribe will hike</i>
<i>deep into the jungle</i>

10
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,901
<i>to take part</i>
<i>in the Tribal Council,</i>

11
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,904
<i>where they must vote one</i>
<i>of their own off the island.</i>

12
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:32,115
<i>In the end, one will remain</i>

13
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:35,577
<i>and will leave the island</i>
<i>with $1 million in cash.</i>

14
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,958
<i>Last week on</i> Survivor:

15
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,085
Yeah, bait's gone.

16
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,422
JEFF:
<i>Food was scarce,</i>
<i>rice was being rationed...</i>

17
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,257
So a can's only going
to last us two days?

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,300
They're eating that much.

19
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,301
JEFF:
<i>And Rich was still</i>

20
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,803
<i>the only one providing fish.</i>

21
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:54,554
Rich is playing a big game.

22
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,264
JEFF:
<i>And so is Greg--</i>

23
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,974
<i>he cut</i>
<i>play-kitten Colleen loose.</i>

24
00:00:58,057 --> 00:00:59,267
GREG:
<i>You look right</i>
<i>in the kitten's eye and snap</i>

25
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,270
its neck-- it's nothing
personal, you're hungry.

26
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,188
JEFF:
<i>And made a move on Rich.</i>

27
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,191
RICHARD:
<i>He' That's great.ing.</i>

28
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,358
JEFF:
<i>The reward challenge</i>

29
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,110
<i>brought videos from home...</i>

30
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:09,402
Hi, Daddy.

31
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,362
Baby.

32
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,530
JEFF:
<i>Except for Jenna.</i>

33
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,823
Oh, don't...

34
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,450
<i>It would've done wonders to see</i>

35
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,202
that my kids are okay.

36
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,370
GERVASE:
<i>She's tugging on people's</i>
<i>emotions right there</i>

37
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,330
and that's a threat for me.

38
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,499
JEFF:
<i>And at Tribal Council...</i>

39
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,500
Is there an alliance?

40
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,501
Do I have to answer?

41
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,710
No, I'm just kidding.

42
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:26,669
No, no.

43
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,631
JEFF:
<i>Last week, Greg was voted off.</i>

44
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:30,381
<i>Eight castaways remain.</i>

45
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,342
<i>Who will be voted off tonight?</i>

46
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:45,456
That was my deal--
out of here.

47
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,625
Well, I don't know
if they were...

48
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,627
RICHARD:
<i>Outright lying</i>
<i>is absolutely essential,</i>

49
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,296
<i>especially when you have</i>

50
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,464
a host like Jeff,
who's as bold as to ask

51
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:57,760
"Well, so Sue, tell me,
is there an alliance?"

52
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,803
What a question.

53
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,641
You think
I'm going to come out and say

54
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,603
"Oh, yeah, we got four of us
voting up against all you guys.

55
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,105
We're going to knock you all
down to the end."<i> Come on.</i>

56
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:12,108
It won't be
bad if you get
in the water.

57
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,402
COLLEEN:
<i>Those people flat out lied</i>

58
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,446
<i>in front of a national</i>
<i>television audience.</i>

59
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,782
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>they want a million bucks</i>

60
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,451
<i>and they're going to get it...</i>

61
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,453
And I loved Jeff's question

62
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,122
"Is, uh, a deserving person
going to win this money?"

63
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,999
The answer to that question
is "no."

64
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,792
How you doing this
morning, Kelly?

65
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,920
I'm doing.

66
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,296
I didn't really sleep
last night.

67
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,672
No?

68
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,467
KELLY:
<i>This whole alliance thing</i>
<i>is getting too stupid</i>

69
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,801
and too crazy.

70
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,303
If we stick with it,

71
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,388
it's just like lining lambs
to the slaughter.

72
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,474
Who goes next? Who goes...?
like, that's no fun.

73
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,060
We were targeted
already, anyway.

74
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,811
If we keep
annoying them
like we are,

75
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,022
we're going to be
gone really soon.

76
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,440
KELLY:
<i>Yeah, I don't like it.</i>

77
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:53,483
<i>I-I'm not happy playing</i>
<i>the game that way.</i>

78
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,110
If I'm going to win,

79
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,112
if I'm really going to be
the last survivor,

80
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,489
if I'm really going to survive
and really do this,

81
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,951
<i>then it has to be on my own.</i>

82
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:28,518
SEAN:
<i>Rich is definitely</i>
<i>in this very good</i>

83
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,561
strategic position
for himself, I think.

84
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,022
He's worked hard.
Well, not that hard.

85
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,774
Just happens to be good
at spearfishing.

86
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,484
He doesn't do much else.

87
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:40,154
He sure don't do a damn thing
around here except fish.

88
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,531
SEAN:
But he's a good sport.

89
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,367
I mean, we call him all kinds
of names and make fun of him.

90
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,576
I sort of liked him
before I knew he was queer.

91
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,371
Lost a prong to a good,
five-foot nurse shark.

92
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:52,750
I got to take them
by hand from now on,
like Tarzan-style--

93
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,377
wrestle them.

94
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,546
He's in an ideal position,
'cause I think

95
00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:00,049
he's the epicenter
of the power right now.

96
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,135
He's bringing in the fish.

97
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,845
Oh, my God.

98
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:08,182
There's got to be 25 pounds
or 20 pounds of fish here.

99
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:08,975
It's all about
the fish, man.

100
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,893
The fish don't
influence me, though.

101
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:11,894
No?

102
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,354
Not in the least.

103
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,565
You can take the heavy-duty
equipment and I'll putz.

104
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,899
Okay.

105
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,401
'Cause I fed you today.

106
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,861
Yeah.

107
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,571
SEAN:
<i>I love Rich, I really do.</i>

108
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,697
<i>He's been a great asset</i>
<i>to this camp,</i>

109
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,575
but he is a little immature
in his motives at times.

110
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,618
You'll be so damn full
of protein after this meal,

111
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:28,536
you won't know
what to do with yourself.

112
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,580
This is funny.

113
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,748
I am...

114
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,583
the master.

115
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,085
He's very protective
about spearing fish

116
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,254
<i>and he brings it up</i>
<i>at every island council:</i>

117
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:39,464
<i>"I'm catching fish.</i>
<i>Don't vote me off."</i>

118
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,673
<i>It's an insecurity aspect</i>
<i>to him.</i>

119
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:41,549
The last island Tribal Council

120
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,468
when I was talking about, um...

121
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,637
"I'll be staying around here
because I'm providing fish"

122
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,638
was an outright blatant lie.

123
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,474
I'm staying around here
'cause I'm bright.

124
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,101
It has nothing to do
with catching fish.

125
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,103
That is a
lot of fish.

126
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,855
RICHARD:
<i>Catching fish</i>
<i>makes people happy,</i>

127
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,106
<i>but that's not why</i>

128
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,775
they're voting me here.

129
00:05:58,858 --> 00:05:59,609
They're not voting me off

130
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,987
<i>because I'm not letting them.</i>

131
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,782
SUSAN:
Tell me if
I'm doing it...

132
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,283
like cutting
too much meat.

133
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,619
RICHARD:
No, you're doing pretty well.

134
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,621
Got it.

135
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,790
Now rip it out.

136
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,541
I'm sorry, I can't...

137
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,461
You want
to do one?

138
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,629
COLLEEN:
<i>Do you see them</i>

139
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,714
<i>bringing these stingrays</i>

140
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,800
and stuff in?

141
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,426
They're, like,
still flapping around

142
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,637
and they take this dull knife,
and chop off their head.

143
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,679
It's disgusting.

144
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,809
(<i> loud slapping</i> )

145
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,685
<i>If I choose</i>

146
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,479
to watch my dinner
that came from the sea

147
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,147
be killed or not be killed,

148
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,774
<i>I would rather not</i>
<i>watch it be killed.</i>

149
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,237
JENNA:
Rich, you're the man.

150
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,614
You are the reef master.

151
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:57,917
Yeah, there's some water
over here.

152
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,003
JENNA:
Oh, I'm so
looking forward

153
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,797
to this now.

154
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,215
I wouldn't even eat fish sticks.

155
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,466
SUSAN:
I'm just hungry.

156
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,009
I could care
less about that.

157
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,179
<i>When Rich came in</i>
<i>with a fish,</i>

158
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,390
I said to Rudy, "I should go
and stoke that fire up."

159
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,017
<i>And Rudy's, like, "Oh, no,</i>
<i>no, no, that's good enough.</i>

160
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,311
<i>It's hot enough,"</i>

161
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:17,687
and it wasn't hot enough.

162
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,029
RICHARD:
Well, I would say
it's done, Rudy,

163
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,823
and black.

164
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,158
It curls up
into little balls.

165
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,492
I know.

166
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,660
SUSAN:
<i>The fish is tough to cook</i>

167
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,078
<i>because they cooked</i>
<i>a little bit</i>

168
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,371
<i>and then they cooled off</i>

169
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:37,165
and they had to start
the fire back up

170
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,876
and cook the fish again,
so Rich is sort of irritated.

171
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,211
(<i> rhythmic tapping</i> )

172
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,046
RICHARD:
<i>Rudy's clueless</i>

173
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,551
when it comes to fish, and, um,
you know, really ruined it.

174
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,552
You ready?

175
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,887
Yep.

176
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,725
RICHARD:
<i>Nobody knew what to do</i>
<i>with cooking the fish</i>

177
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,226
and so it sits here

178
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,103
and it sits half on the heat,
and it sits over there

179
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,897
and it gets turned over
halfway and it doesn't,

180
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,607
<i>and so it's half-cooked</i>
<i>and overcooked and undercooked</i>

181
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,028
<i>and half of the fish,</i>
<i>half of the three rays</i>

182
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,989
were wasted...
and that infuriates me.

183
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:12,783
It's overdone.

184
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:13,784
It's charcoal.

185
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:14,785
Its wings are curled up.

186
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,456
It's very, very easy
to put a fire together

187
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,707
that's nice and hot.

188
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,750
Just 'cause<i> I</i> see
how to do that

189
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,420
doesn't mean anybody else
should know how, so...

190
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:25,713
<i>I was sitting there, just</i>
<i>pissed off, really frustrated.</i>

191
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,090
<i>I don't want anybody around</i>

192
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,717
<i>I don't want anybody near me</i>
<i>when I'm frustrated,</i>

193
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,594
and people are sitting there,
"What's wrong?"

194
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,386
and that just makes it worse.

195
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,388
GERVASE:
Don't be hard
on yourself.

196
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,389
Huh?

197
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,266
Just take it easy--
let us be hard on you.

198
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,601
Okay. Go for it, dude.

199
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,437
GERVASE:
Don't you know how
a fire works, man?

200
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,939
RICHARD:
Uh-huh, I do...

201
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,149
and I'm not really patient
about teaching anybody,

202
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,735
so I'm just going
to do it myself from now on.

203
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,737
<i>I probably won't get fish,</i>
<i>actually, for a</i>
<i>little while now,</i>

204
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,989
<i>anyway, because they need</i>
<i>to appreciate it.</i>

205
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,408
<i>I'm bringing in too many</i>
<i>right now.</i>

206
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,619
<i>I brought in a bunch yesterday</i>
<i>and a bunch today</i>

207
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,787
and so we need
to take a break

208
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,789
and let them kind of hunger
for it again.

209
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,249
COLLEEN:
<i>So many times Rich opens</i>
<i>his mouth,</i>

210
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,124
<i>and I just want to be, like,</i>

211
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,418
"Oh, be quiet over there
in the corner.

212
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,630
"You're not making any sense,
and you think you're so smart

213
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,591
"and you're... just go home,
and go get your liposuction

214
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,010
and go catch more fish,
'cause you're bugging me."

215
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,596
You know, he thinks
he's so above everybody

216
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,681
and is full of baloney, really.

217
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,517
RICHARD:
<i>Pathetic, burnt, overdone</i>

218
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,810
wasteful again.

219
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,937
Amazes me.

220
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,543
KELLY:
<i>The hardest part now is...</i>

221
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,544
(<i> sighs</i> )

222
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,003
<i>...the food.</i>

223
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,838
We're hungry

224
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:53,759
and Rich is the only one
that can fish.

225
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,845
You got to go out
an hour before it gets dark

226
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:56,846
and then, right at
when it was getting dark,

227
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,348
we started getting our bites

228
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,018
and then, after it got dark,
we didn't get no more bites.

229
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,561
We've gone fishing
in the morning.

230
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,187
We've gone in the afternoon...
at night.

231
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,022
We're not catching any fish.

232
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,024
SUSAN:
I'm getting
to the point

233
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,025
if there ain't
no crabs out there

234
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,945
in a day or two,
I ain't gonna to do it no more.

235
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,197
It bothers me
that I can't get my own food,

236
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,699
that I have to rely
on someone else.

237
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,908
Ooh, big fish.

238
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:21,454
Oh, wow!

239
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,205
We got a fish, you guys, right?

240
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,498
It's a fish, for sure.

241
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,292
Whoo!

242
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:26,876
That's so awesome.
Look at that thing.

243
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,918
He's pretty big.

244
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,712
Fish!

245
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,465
Bloop.

246
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,425
SUSAN:
Good proof
that we can get the fish.

247
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,762
We caught a fish today,
finally-- yes!--

248
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,555
and it feels so good.

249
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,349
I feel so accomplished now.

250
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,729
JENNA:
<i>I think, uh,</i>
<i>it disappointed Rich</i>

251
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,565
that us girls
kept these crab traps going

252
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:49,940
and that we caught a fish.

253
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,736
That's good.

254
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:54,779
<i>He's going to make</i>
<i>a big point</i>

255
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,740
<i>"Oh, that ain't a lot</i>
<i>to feed you,"</i>

256
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,200
but it's a point
that we did catch it.

257
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,786
So, I don't give a (<i> blip</i> )
about how he's going to see it.

258
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,204
We caught it;
I feel accomplished.

259
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,288
We've done it all now.

260
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,165
We got a fish, man,
a edible fish.

261
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:06,957
I ain't kidding you.

262
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,085
RUDY:
Big one?

263
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,420
SUSAN:
Yeah, pretty
nice size.

264
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,088
RUDY:
Is he kicking?

265
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,964
Yeah, he's
still alive.

266
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,216
Yeah, he's still alive.

267
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,592
Yeah, that's a good one.

268
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,135
I know it.

269
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,053
SUSAN:
<i>But, yeah,</i>
<i>he's going to be...</i>

270
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,846
<i>I</i> think<i> it might bother him.</i>

271
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,599
In a way, I hope it does.

272
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:24,934
I hope it bugs him,
'cause now he can't

273
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,978
<i>say that no more, you know?</i>

274
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,940
<i>'Cause us girls</i>
<i>caught this one.</i>

275
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,948
(<i> buzzing</i> )

276
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,675
Oh, wow.

277
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,426
<i>I love getting mail</i>

278
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,927
<i>and there was a log hanging</i>

279
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,804
<i>above our mailbox.</i>

280
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,639
<i>It looked an awful lot like</i>
<i>part of the tree,</i>

281
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,516
<i>but when I took it down,</i>
<i>there was a sign on there</i>

282
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,559
a little a nursery rhyme,
it says:

283
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,310
"If you can make like a monkey,

284
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,478
"then you'll be home free,

285
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,980
"if you want barbecue for lunch,

286
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:11,981
then go climb a tree."

287
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,941
Somebody's eating
a barbecue.

288
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,317
That sounds like fun.

289
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,027
Shish kebob!

290
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,029
SEAN:
<i>I'm sure the game is</i>
<i>anything but simple,</i>

291
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:22,199
<i>just, like,</i>
<i>just pick a rope and run.</i>

292
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,335
Hey, look who it is!

293
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,129
Hey, Jeff.

294
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,589
Well, here's the deal.

295
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,841
I thought today,
we'd switch it up a little

296
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,844
and show you the carrot,
the reward, before the challenge

297
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,053
so you guys know
exactly what it is...

298
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,181
Listen to
your stomach.

299
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,640
You're going for.

300
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,224
Are you
smelling this?

301
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,393
This is
today's reward.

302
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,020
Oh, man!

303
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,647
JEFF:
Some good, old-fashioned,
American barbecue.

304
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:54,857
We got it all.

305
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,192
All this stuff, here...

306
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:56,984
Look at that,
a lot of meat.

307
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,570
Steak and a hot dog.

308
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:00,654
JEFF:
Some kebobs.

309
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,531
We got your buns...
your chips.

310
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,992
A little something
to remind you of home.

311
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,703
And since we're talking
about home...

312
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:10,706
Why not?

313
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:11,957
Love letters from home.

314
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,209
Jenna, yours on top.

315
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,210
Oh, I got one!

316
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,753
I'm so excited.

317
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,005
JEFF:
One of you guys gets
a great barbecue,

318
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:18,881
you get to read your
letter from home,

319
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,092
and does it get any
better than that?

320
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,844
<i>Sound good?</i>

321
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,305
GERVASE:
<i>I was shaking</i>
<i>when I saw the food.</i>

322
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,015
I started shaking
because I'm, like,
"That's real chicken."

323
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:31,060
Now think about that
and then think about<i> rice.</i>

324
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,603
I'm thinking,
how am I going

325
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,063
to get my grubby
little hands

326
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,731
on some of
them burgers.

327
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,316
I'm prepared
to eat rice tonight...

328
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,734
(<i> chuckles</i> )

329
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:39,735
like every night.

330
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,779
I want the letter from home more

331
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,864
because I can go back
and get rice,

332
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,867
but I haven't seen
or heard anything from my kids.

333
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,245
That's it, I'm going big,
going for all of it.

334
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,413
No offense, Jeff, but if I win,

335
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,375
you're going hungry, bud,
'cause I'm not sharing.

336
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,877
Then, let's go do this thing
and come back and eat.

337
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:57,378
Man, oh, man.

338
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,296
I want this stuff.

339
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,844
JEFF:
Here's the deal:
basically, it's a ropes course.

340
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,096
There are 16 legs.

341
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,391
On each one of them is
a medallion with your number.

342
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,935
You guys have all been
pre-assigned a number.

343
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,396
Pretty simple-- you got to get
through all of them,

344
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,439
grab a medallion from each one.

345
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,608
First person back here
on this platform

346
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,569

348
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,196
If you fall off the course,
you're out.

349
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,323
Sound good?

350
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,616
Everybody get ready.

351
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,827
You got an eye
on where you're going?

352
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,078
Get up here on the
ring, Sean... buddy.

353
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,955
Yeah.

Good job, Rich.

361
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,054
Your first medallion.

Keep it up,
Colleen.

363
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,940
You're in
second place.

364
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,984
Okay, so I love being tall.

00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,485
JEFF:
Try to keep
mental notes

00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,279
of where you've been
and where you've

367
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,363
still got to go.

368
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,157
Careful, Jenna.

369
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,664
Keep it up, Sean.

370
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,334

371
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,551
Doing great, Rudy--

372
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:31,472
Come on,
I got to go under you.

373

00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,018
All right?

00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,019
Yep.

Good work together,

377
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,612
Keep at it, Rudy.

378
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:51,033
You're still
in the lead, Kelly.

379
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,160
Oh, no.

380
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,167
Done!

381
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,711
You got to get back
here to the platform.

382
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,505
Okay, is anybody
else finished?

383
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,255
Oh, that's me!

384
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,256
Colleen or Kelly--

385
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,926

here wins.

Good job, Colleen.

395
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,695
We've got
this great barbecue--

396
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,405
it looked pretty good...
a lot of food--

397
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,239
we've got a great letter
from home.

398
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,199

Everybody!

400
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,870
Don't even make

I do want you to pick one
person to come with us...

402
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,916
Do they get
the letter, too?

403
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:42,668
JEFF:
This person will
get their letter

404
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,836
and this person

405
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,087

Jenna is going
to hear from her kids.

409
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,134
Good work.

410
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,969
That wasn't
a tough decision, was it?

411
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,095
She didn't get a video.

412
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,264
Thank you
so much.

413
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,265
JEFF:
Very nice gesture.

414
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,893
So, you guys can, um,
sadly head back to camp

415
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,688
and we're going to head down
to the beach

416
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,064

417
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,065

(<i> laughing</i> )

421
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,335
Listen to what
Sean says today...

422
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,337
What did he say?

423
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,047
He goes, "Well..."

424
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,840
'cause they voted four
against Dirk

425
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,008
when he wasn't there.

426
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:14,760
Then they voted four
against Gretchen

427
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,845
and then it's, like,
they voted six

428
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,847
against... but obviously,
four against Greg,

429
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,224
and he's, like,
"If it happens one more time,

430
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:23,310
I know..."
and I was, like,

431
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,062
"What are you talking about?

432
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,522
It's happened three times."

433
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,106
I mean, what's going on?

434
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,650
But, see, Sean's the...

435
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,694
Sean's the swing vote,
you know what I mean?

436
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,530
'Cause you, me and Gervase
could definitely

00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,531
do something.

438

They're going
to pick people off

until it gets down to them

440
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,037
and then they're going
to start eating each other,

441
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,247
you know what I mean?

442
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,915
But I'm saying, like,
why are we sitting back

443
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,333
and watching it happen?

444
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,668

"How did I lose yesterday

'Cause today is even bigger

That's the only thing

00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,354
I think it's a fair system.

I think you're
a perfect example.

00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,398
I'm glad I decided
to not go back

00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,525
for the alphabetical order
after you won immunity

558
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:25,195
'cause it gives the contestant
an out to avoid my vote.

559
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:25,779
I think it adds
a new dimension to the game,

Yeah, did you know

564

that we're going by Zelda now?

Zoey.

Why? Why do
you want that?

Uh, alphabetical reasons.

00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,751
Oh.

It would make me happy

572
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,549
if Gervase does not win immunity
this time

573
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,343
'cause I had
to skip him last time--

574
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,137
you know,
I skipped him in the order--

575
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,681
and maybe Jenna will win it
and get out of the order.

576
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:53,557
I know it's nice
that if you win immunity,

577
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,184
you get skipped
and then you never get

578
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,185
in the rotation, like Ger.

579
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,854
JENNA:
Oh, you're out
of the rotation?

580
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,147
Ger is out of the rotation.

581
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,023

<i>"Don't be in the alliance.</i>

00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,528
<i>Don't..." um...</i>

585
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,363
<i>"vote your conscience."</i>

586
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,365
Meanwhile, he's going around
preaching everyone

587
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,324
to vote their conscience

588
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,535
and he's, like,
"Oh, okay, alphabetically."

589
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,912
SEAN:
<i>My votes are going</i>
<i>to go alphabetical.</i>

590
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,330
<i>So, today's Jenna.</i>

591
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,707
If I'm going
to be the swing vote--

592
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,250
which I don't think
I will be--

593
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,751
then I won't vote for her,
obviously.

GERVASE:
<i>Sean... I like Sean.</i>

595
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,921
<i>Sean's a great guy, you know,</i>

596
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,048
<i>but about Sean's</i>
<i>alphabetical order.</i>

597
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,426
It's like my granddaddy
used to say:

598
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,552
"If you want to be seen,
stand up,

599
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,513
"If you want to be heard,
speak up,

600
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,057
and if you want
to be appreciated, shut up."

601
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,726
I'm just going to stay
in alphabetical order.

602
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,728
<i>It's all I can do.</i>

603
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,249
We've tested
your physical strength,

604
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,792
your swimming ability,
your agility,

605
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,377
your speed... all that.

606
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,045
Today is something
a little different.

607
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,755
It's up here, in your head.

608
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,423
This is a game
that requires strategy.

609
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:10,425
It's a lot like chess,
a little bit

610
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:11,760
like tic-tac-toe,

611
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:12,761
but unlike chess,
where you're taking one person,

612
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,722
you've got seven people
to think about.

613
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:18,767
The way the game works is
you'll start on a square

614
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,602
and you'll simply,
one at a time, on my cue

615
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,937
move to another square,

616
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,687
turning the square over
behind you.

617
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,440
As long
as you can keep stepping

618
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:26,775
to another square,
you're still alive,

619
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,818
but when you run out

620
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,279
of red squares
to step on, you're out.

621
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,740
So now, if you just flip over
these squares here,

622
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:36,117
we'll determine
the order.

623
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,118
Oh, yeah, baby.

624
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,912
Oh, yes.

625
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:39,829
Now, in any particular order,

626
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,457
step on one
of the flower squares.

627
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,500
It does not matter.

628
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,293
These are all even
when you begin.

629
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,296
So, Rich, you're up first.

630
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,176
Perfect. Rudy.

631
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:57,097
Sean.

632
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,059
Gervase, to you.

633
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,564
Sue.

634
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:10,652
Colleen.

635
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,281
Kelly.

636
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,827
Jenna.

637
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,214
Sue.

638
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:34,884
Colleen.

639
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:36,803
Colleen.

640
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:37,804
Yeah... I'm out!

641
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:40,473
JEFF:
Take a step back

642
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,475
and flip
that one over.

643
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,059
There you go.

644
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,145
Take a seat
on the log.

645
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,063
That full meal
has got you...

646
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,065
sated.

647
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,859
All right... Kelly.

00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:58,325
Jenna-- out on the island
by herself.

Jenna.

660
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,855
Sean, you foiled my plan.

661
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,231
SEAN:
Sorry, baby.

662
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,316
Was that your
plan, Sean?

663
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,902
No. Well, yeah, once she
got behind me, yeah, yeah.

664
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,446
To block her?

665
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:37,906
Rich.

666
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,075
You need to worry
about yourself, Hatch.

667
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,910
No, there's nothing
I can do.

668
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,079
I'm whimpering
into nowhere-land, here...

669
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,413
Rudy.

670
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,456
Slowly
dying...

671
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,874
the wise old man
is looking good.

672
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:48,875
Sean.

673
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,461
Oh, no, Sean,
no, Sean.

674
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,088
Don't you know
you're dead, Sean?

675
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,130
You're ruining it.

676
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,298
You got 50 million.

677
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,051
She won't last, Sean.

678
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,260
Rudy will last longer.

679
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,678
He'll have to kill me.

680
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,389
Otherwise, I could
have bebopped around.

681
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,599
Sorry. I'm doing what
<i>I</i> think is right.

682
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:05,016
JEFF:
Gervase.an...

683
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,143
Bad move, Sean.

684
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,020
You could have gotten Rudy
out of there.

685
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:09,979
No, he
Yes, he could have.

686
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,815
All right, Rich.

687
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,276
Rudy.

688
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:15,985
Rudy has many
more options.

689
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,779
Down there.

690
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:18,863
He's doing right.

691
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:19,823
You should've
diagonal so...

692
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,450
Don't listen
to her, Rudy.

693
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,619
She's trying to
trick you, Rudy.

694
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:25,620
Shut up.
I am not.

695
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:26,830
It's those young girls,
Rudy,

696
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,456
trying to get
in your head.

697
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,083
Stay strong,
Rudy.

698
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,672
JENNA:
Is it my turn?

699
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:36,840
Gervase.

700
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,844
Still alive.

701
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,804
Jenna, you,
unfortunately,
are not.

702
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:43,847
You're out.

703
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,599
I figured
you are.

704
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,184
Yoo-haw!

705
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,644
JEFF:
Rich, turn over

706
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:49,978
your last tile--
you're done.

707
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,938
Bye!

708
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:55,150
Rudy, it's down
to you three

709
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,819
for immunity from
tonight's vote.

710
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:58,945
Go sidewards!
Go left, Rudy, go left!

711
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,531
GERVASE:
No coaching
from the side.

712
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:02,824
No, no, no.
Directly to your left.

713
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:03,992
GERVASE:
To the right, Rudy!

714
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,326
Take... take...

715
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,494
No, left, Rudy,

716
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,163
because then you
have down here...

717
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,372
Up to the right, Rudy.

718
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,832
She's trying to trick you.

719
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:11,833
No, no, no,
no, buddy.

720
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,334
This one.

721
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,295
Yeah, there
you go.

722
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:15,962
Good job, Rudy.

723
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,465
Gervase.

724
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,010
Ain't gonna work.

725
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,970
You've won, Rudy,
if you take that path.

726
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:24,971
SUSAN:
If you go at a
diagonal across,

727
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,640
you got more squares
than him to land on.

728
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,058
JENNA:
You've got more squares left.

729
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,310
There you go!

730
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:31,686
SUSAN:
There you go.

731
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:33,855
Yeah, now you're
heading up to the beach.

732
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:38,193
I think it's
a foregone
conclusion.

733
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,528
(<i> sighs</i> )

734
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,155
Flip that over,
Gervase.

735
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:44,824
JENNA:
Good job, Rudy.

736
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:45,867
SUSAN:
There you go.

737
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:46,367
You got it, Rudy.

738
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,495
Hang tight, buddy.

739
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,830
We're going to be
taking that tile
from you any minute.

740
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,751
(<i> cheering</i> )

741
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:56,294
JEFF:
Rudy, you win.

742
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,838
Take the honor of
flipping the rest

743
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,715
<i>of these over for me.</i>

744
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,254
(<i> buzzing</i> )

745
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,797
Tonight's going
to be interesting.

746
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,465
Oh, yeah?

747
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,299
SUSAN:
<i>Really, when they</i>
<i>first got here,</i>

748
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,051
they were
<i>really</i> ambitious.

749
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,427
Now you can see
their ambition's

750
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,137
kind of, like,
filtering a little bit.

751
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,056
If I feel like sitting
in a hammock all day,

752
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,766
I'm going to sit
in a hammock all day.

753
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:52,934
I'm not going
to stop you.

754
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:53,768
No.

755
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:56,271
COLLEEN:
<i>We had fun, you know?</i>

756
00:30:56,354 --> 00:31:00,024
We had-- Pagong was a good,
was a good place to live.

757
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,735
Now we moved
into the new neighborhood

758
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,445
with the nasty neighbors.

759
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,113
(<i> grunting</i> )

760
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,574
SUSAN:
I want to go over

761
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,701
in my house for
awhile and bitch.

762
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,911
COLLEEN:
<i>Then we came in here</i>

763
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,413
like, "Maybe we can
all be friends"

764
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,290
and they came in, like,
"We can smash 'em."

765
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,125
Yes, they did.

766
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,836
COLLEEN:
<i>The people who came in swinging</i>
<i>were Rich and Sue.</i>

767
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:20,837
<i>They knew.</i>

768
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,838
They're smart.

769
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,840
They're very smart people...

770
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:26,426
Although Rich
is just a numbskull. God!

771
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:29,637
RICHARD:
All you 16, 15 weirdoes
are making me nutty.

772
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,972
I'm losing my mind.

773
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,140
COLLEEN:
<i>People are wishy-washy.</i>

774
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,100
They're conniving
and they're stupid,

775
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,811
and that's what's happening,

776
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:39,814
and it's all out in the open
for everybody to see.

777
00:31:39,897 --> 00:31:43,818
<i>The decision</i>
<i>that I feel I'm left with is</i>

778
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:46,321
<i>do I interact</i>
<i>with these people, have fun</i>

779
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,656
<i>and just wait</i>
<i>till my ticket comes up</i>

780
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,200
<i>or do I try and strategize</i>
<i>and try and make a difference?</i>

781
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,286
It's so sad now.

782
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:55,830
You know, we just wait,
you know?

783
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:56,831
Unless...

784
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:58,207
we think of something.

785
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,001
(<i> whistling</i> )

786
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,210
Yesterday, at the dinner,

787
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,463
we had a whole conversation

788
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:04,172
about forming a new alliance.

789
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,007
Yeah, shh...

790
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,176
<i>We're going to vote the same</i>

791
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,220
and we figure that this puts us
in jeopardy for the next one,

792
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:14,223
but we were
in jeopardy anyway, so...

793
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,142
GERVASE:
<i>Well, we tried</i>
<i>the "be nice, honor" way.</i>

794
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:18,811
<i>It didn't work,</i>
<i>so don't be stupid anymore.</i>

795
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,313
It's just, we're smarter now.

796
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,856
We saw that
that way didn't work,

797
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:22,106
so we got to switch gears.

798
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,663
COLLEEN:
<i>What if I</i>

799
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,873
just had this
as a skirt?

800
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:41,542
Oh, that's killer!

801
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,044
GERVASE:
I don't think
models even wear

802
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,088
skirts that short.

803
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:49,384
JENNA:
Go for it, Colleen!
Wear it!

804
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,929
Not doing that, Sue?

805
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,014
Jenna and I were just,

806
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,224
you know, goofing off

807
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,184
<i>and, uh, Kelly decided</i>
<i>to join in.</i>

808
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:01,187
<i>I feel bad for Kelly</i>
<i>because she wants to play.</i>

809
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,564
<i>And Rich is, like,</i>
<i>"Something's happened to you</i>

810
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,732
<i>"since these girls came.</i>

811
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,275
I'm really worried about you,"

812
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,236
kind of putting her in her place

813
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,237
and makes her feel

814
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,947
<i>a little self-conscious.</i>

815
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,615
<i>By her being nervous</i>

816
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,118
and wishy-washy
about where her loyalties lie,

817
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,244
it's really making
Sue and Rich nervous.

818
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,245
You're young.

819
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,288
You hung out
with the chicks.

820
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,207
There's more Pagong members
than Tagi members

821
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,458
and the Pagong members...

822
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,960
Pagong members don't
like any of us.

823
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,795
They like you a lot better
than any of us.

824
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,255
Kelly's acting a little odd.

825
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:31,759
<i>She's dressing like</i>
<i>the other two that are her age,</i>

826
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,094
and I'm hoping

827
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,138
that Kelly hasn't, uh,
shifted trust

828
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,932
and-and joined forces
with somebody else.

829
00:33:38,015 --> 00:33:39,267
All them girls
are dressed the same today.

830
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,437
SEAN:
<i>Yeah, they're dressing</i>
<i>like, uh, superheroes.</i>

831
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,438
RUDY:
<i>Like who?</i>

832
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,564
<i>Superheroes.</i>

833
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,943
They were dancing around here
a little while ago.

834
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:50,653
It looked like
the third grade.

835
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,613
<i>I thought</i>
<i>about a female alliance</i>

836
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,698
<i>and watching them,</i>

837
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,117
<i>the way they walk around,</i>
<i>hand in hand.</i>

838
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,787
I even thought about lesbianism,
but, uh, maybe not.

839
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:00,788
I don't know.

840
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:04,125
And, uh, it could happen
if they had any brains,

841
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,919
but I don't think they got
enough brains to do that.

842
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,629
I move objects with my mind,

843
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,422
but only I can see it.

844
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,799
KELLY:
<i>I probably will have</i>

845
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,301
the swing vote tonight.

846
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,012
<i>I'd said before, you know,</i>
<i>alliance or no alliance,</i>

847
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,139
<i>there's two people that I have</i>
<i>in mind to vote off</i>

848
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,808
<i>and they're two people that,</i>
<i>um, are-are competition,</i>

849
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,644
<i>but, um, they annoy me</i>

850
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,104
and... (<i> chuckling</i> )

851
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,397
they're kind of sucky
to live with.

852
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:35,281
Let's roll, Gervase.

853
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,408
Get out of here.

854
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,374
COLLEEN:
<i>I really don't know</i>
<i>what's going to happen</i>

855
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,668
<i>at Tribal Council tonight.</i>

856
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:48,377
I know I'm voting for Rich.

857
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,338
I know Jenna's voting for Rich.

858
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,090
I know Gervase
is voting for Rich.

859
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,343
GERVASE:
<i>As long as he's catching fish,</i>

860
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,054
people are gonna try
to keep him around,

861
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,348
so I say, get rid of Rich
and we all starve together.

862
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,558
JENNA:
<i>The rest of my alliance,</i>

863
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,268
<i>if that's what</i>
<i>you want to call it?</i>

864
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,354
Yeah, we're all voting for Rich.

865
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,147
He's ruthless

866
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:11,192
and the fact that we're voting
him out on his birthday--

867
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,819
it's not lost on me.

868
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,029
<i>We're giving him</i>
<i>a birthday present.</i>

869
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:16,823
Okay, let's do this, Brutus!

870
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:17,990
Gotta go.

871
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:31,003
JEFF:
<i>Today's immunity challenge</i>
<i>saw wisdom and strategy</i>

872
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,047
<i>outplay youth and strength.</i>

873
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,340
<i>Tonight it's Rudy</i>
<i>who's safe from the vote</i>

874
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:37,176
<i>as the others</i>
<i>contemplate their fate.</i>

875
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,390
But this is not
the only vote on their mind.

876
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:46,435
Beginning tonight with Greg,
all members voted off the island

877
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,354
will return
to subsequent Tribal Councils

878
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,397
as part of a jury.

879
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,233
They will gather information

880
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,401
for a very important decision,

881
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:57,071
because, ultimately,
these seven will decide

882
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:58,447
who, of the final two survivors,

883
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:02,451
leaves the island
with the million-dollar prize.

884
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,296
(<i> gong clanging</i> )

885
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,605
You're back.

886
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,480
Tribal Council
number nine.

887
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,775
27 days you guys
have been here.

888
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,986
At the last
Tribal Council,
we established

889
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:39,280
our core group of nine,
so from that

890
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:42,241
two of you will make
it to the final vote.

891
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,284
The other seven

892
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,786
will form a jury that
will really decide

893
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:46,787
that final vote.

894
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,916
Now, in order to make
an informed decision,

895
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,627
the jury needs
information.

896
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,338
So, beginning tonight, Greg
will be joining us here

897
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,797
as part of the jury.

898
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,132
He's merely here

899
00:36:58,215 --> 00:37:00,009
to observe, gather
information

900
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,510
that he'll base
his decision on

901
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:06,140
and at each tribal
council, when somebody
else is voted off,

902
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:09,644
they will return to join Greg.

903
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,103
Happy birthday
to you, Mr. Hatch.

904
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:11,812
Thanks, Jeff.

905
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,814
Something we talked about today.

906
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:14,815
You were going to spend the day
in your birthday suit.

907
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,776
That was part of your original
idea, anyway.

908
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:17,777
Yep.

909
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,654
A couple of people
voiced concern

910
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,864
that, uh, "Maybe
I don't like this."

911
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,366
Well, I just enjoy
being nude.

912
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:26,369
I'm on a deserted island in the
middle of the South China Sea.

913
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,120
I thought, what better place?

914
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,331
What better place than
to just hang out nude?

915
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,540
But it did make a couple
of people uncomfortable

916
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,334
so I thought,
"Why bother?"

917
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,336
Sean. I got to ask you

918
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:38,130
about the alphabet thing.

919
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,799
The alphabet.

920
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:42,802
Give me the rationale so I'm
absolutely clear on it.

921
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:43,844
The rationale
is many-fold.

922
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:44,971
First of all,
it gives me an order

923
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,180
that I can follow
pretty easily--

924
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:47,181
that's always nice.

925
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:48,182
And it is strategic.

926
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:49,433
If you look at the order,
the actual alphabet,

927
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,519
a lot of the Pagong people
in the beginning,

928
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,520
a lot of Tagi people
in the end.

929
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,646
This tortures me.

930
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,523
Every three days. I hate it.

931
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,483
Jenna, what's
your take on that?

932
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:58,567
I'm next.

933
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,694
I'm today.

934
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:00,736
That's true.

935
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,154
Yes. I'm "J."

936
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,156
That's, that's cool.

937
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,866
She knows she wouldn't
take it personally

938
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,410
and I think
she's a safe vote tonight.

939
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,494
If I was... felt
she was in jeopardy,

940
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:11,539
I would think twice
at the very least

941
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,540
of casting a vote.

942
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,041
Sue, what's your
take on that

943
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:14,750
as somebody who
might come up soon

944
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,086
in the alphabet
and get a vote

945
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,421
against you
even if Sean

946
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:21,257
thinks you're the
greatest person here?

947
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,425
Oh, Sean just...
he's neurotic.

948
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:25,219
He's just, he's an idiot.

949
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:26,303
SEAN:
Thanks a lot, Sue.

950
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,388
Thank you very much.

951
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,433
It's like, wow, okay,
so I'm next, you know?

952
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,768
That's the way he votes,
that's the way he votes.

953
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,520
I... I just think he just...

954
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:35,896
I don't know,<i> that</i>
or he doesn't have

955
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,731
enough balls to make a decision.

956
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,900
I don't have
a malicious bone in my body

957
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,736
and I think that
casting a vote,

958
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:42,445
it makes me
feel malicious.

959
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,571
I want to avoid it.

960
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,531
Yeah, but you came
into this knowing...

961
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,616
knowing you were going
to have to do this.

962
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,202
Me, I've changed my vote

963
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,412
like, three times
within the last two hours.

964
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,081
And now it's me, right?

965
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,249
(<i> laughing</i> )

966
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:57,918
No. No.

967
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,003
How important
is Richard right now?

968
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,797
He seems to be the only guy--
at least of who's left--

969
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,549
that's able
to catch fish.

970
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:04,884
No. We did today.

971
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,594
Trapped it.

972
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,888
We nailed a fish today
in the trap.

973
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,556
They got a fish.

974
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:11,932
SUSAN:
We got a fish today.

975
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,267
A nice-sized fish.

976
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,268
I'm outta here.

977
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:16,270
We gave it
to Richard for his birthday.

978
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:18,230
All right, it's
time to vote.

979
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:18,564
Gervase.

980
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,747
My vote's for Rich

981
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,624
because the longer Rich is
on this island,

982
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,459
the bigger of a threat
he becomes to me

983
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,127
taking that million dollars,

984
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,837
so I figure
if I get rid of him now,

985
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,714
everybody else will be cake,
so, happy birthday, Rich.

986
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,727
Eliminating a big mouth.

987
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,491
Continuing my alphabetic
strategy,

988
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,660
Jenna, you know I love you,
no offense to this.

989
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,495
I hope you don't get voted off.

990
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,955
I don't think...

991
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:18,666
you might have one vote or two
votes or something like that

992
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:19,542
but nothing major,
I don't think. I hope.

993
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,811
Fish or not, I think
he's getting near the point,

994
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,688
he's ready to go home.

995
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,523
Even though it is his birthday.

996
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,528
JEFF:
As always,
your identity

997
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,573
at Tribal Council is noted
by your fire, your torch.

998
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,408
Directly across from you

999
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,868
are the eight torches

1000
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,703
of the first eight people
voted off.

1001
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,414
Tonight, another torch will be
added to that group

1002
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:02,710
and that person will join Greg
next week as part of our jury.

1003
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:03,711
I'll go tally the votes.

1004
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,722
I just want to remind you
that once the votes are tallied,

1005
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,807
the decision is final.

1006
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,309
The person will be asked

1007
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:21,020
to leave the Tribal Council area
immediately.

1008
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:23,522
Now I'll read the votes.

1009
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:16,867
That's three votes for Jenna,
three votes for Rich.

1010
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,291
The last vote...

1011
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,209
"J" for Jenna.

1012
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:30,047
Jenna, you need to bring
your torch over.

1013
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,771
Jenna, the tribe
has spoken.

1014
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,483
It's time for
you to go.

1015
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,609
Thanks.

1016
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:50,734
Good-bye.

1017
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,798
Jenna is now part
of the jury.

1018
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:15,134
She'll return next week
and join Greg.

1019
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:15,718
The rest of you

1020
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,053
can head back to camp.

1021
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,138
Good night.

1022
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,790
<i>Next wee</i> A cigar!vivor...

1023
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,001
<i>Good news for Gervase.</i>

1024
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:52,212
Hey, everybody, it's a boy!

1025
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,881
<i>Having left the alliance,</i>

1026
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,382
<i>will Kelly now vote</i>
<i>against them?</i>

1027
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,217
You're seeming
more down.

1028
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,179
KELLY:
<i>And if I'm going to do</i>
<i>something conniving and dirty,</i>

1029
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:01,889
let's get Rich off.

1030
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,724
Me and Kelly are
taking him down.

1031
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,855
Well, I had a good time.

1032
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:11,565
It was a great time
on the island.

1033
00:44:11,648 --> 00:44:13,567
<i>I felt like I was</i>
<i>targeted tonight</i>

1034
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:14,610
<i>because they knew that</i>

1035
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:16,737
<i>Sean would vote for me</i>
<i>alphabetically,</i>

1036
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,072
<i>so they knew they'd get</i>
<i>an easy off with me.</i>

1037
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:21,241
<i>They were more</i>
<i>powerful because</i>
<i>Pagong went into it</i>

1038
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,702
<i>a little naive,</i>
<i>so, that's it.</i>

1039
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,412
<i>I had</i>
<i>a really good time,</i>

1040
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,624
and no hard feelings
and nothing's
taken personally.
