>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR", IN AN EPIC BATTLE

2
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:06,715
BETWEEN THE YOUNG AND THE OLD,
FORMER N.F.L.

3
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:10,260
COACH JIMMY JOHNSON EMERGED AS A
LEADER OF THE OLDER TRIBE.

4
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,929
>> EVERYBODY IN THIS WORLD NEEDS
MOTIVATION

5
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:15,598
AND I THINK I CAN HELP MOTIVATE
THIS TEAM.

6
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,393
>> Jeff: BUT MARTY RESENTED
COACH JIMMY'S STAR POWER.

7
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,103
>> I WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH
JIMMY JOHNSON IN THIS GAME.

8
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:23,148
>> Jeff: LATER THE BALANCE OF
POWER SHIFTED IN MARTY'S FAVOR

9
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:26,609
WHEN HE AND JILL FOUND A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

10
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,278
>> OH, JILL!

11
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,989
THE CHALLENGE NOW IS HOW DO WE
MAKE IT WORK?

12
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:35,493
>> Jeff: AT THE YOUNGER TRIBE,
SHANNON CALLED THE SHOTS.

13
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,954
>> I JUST WANT TO SECURE US TO
GO TO THE FINAL THING.

14
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:40,790
>> Jeff: HE ALSO ALIGNED HIMSELF
TO ALINA AND KELLY B.

15
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:44,127
WHO HAD A CLUE TO THE IMMUNITY
IDOL.

16
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,296
AT THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, THE
OLDER TRIBE HAD THE MEDALLION

17
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,174
OF POWER WHICH ROE SIDES ARE AN
ADVANTAGE.

18
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:53,136
IF YOU USE IT, THE MEDALLION
GOES TO THE YOUNGER TRIBE.

19
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:53,678
AND THEY WILL HAVE AN
OPPORTUNITY TO USE IT

20
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,638
AT THE NEXT CHALLENGE

21
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:56,890
>> I'M GOING TO USE IT.

22
00:00:56,973 --> 00:01:00,435
>> Jeff: PLAYING THE MEDALLION
TURNED OUT TO BE A SMART MOVE

23
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,645
BECAUSE IT HELPED THE OLDER
TRIBE WIN.

24
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,772
TYRONE SCORES AND WINS!

25
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:08,193
BACK AT THE YOUNGER CAMP, BRENDA
WAS ON THE HOT SEAT.

26
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,611
>> IF MY ALLIANCE IS DOING WHAT
THEY SAY THEY'RE DOING,

27
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:10,487
BRENDA IS THE FIRST ONE TO GO.

28
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,614
>> Jeff: SO SHE CONSPIRED WITH
NAONKA

29
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,449
TO DISMANTLE SHANNON'S MAJORITY.

30
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:17,285
>> WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET PEOPLE
TO GET SHANNON OUT.

31
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,703
>> ME, TOO!

32
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,498
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
SHANNON WENT ON A TIRADE

33
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:25,043
THAT ALIENATED ALMOST ALL OF HIS
REMAINING ALLIES.

34
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,836
>> I'LL SPEAK MY MIND, THAT'S
WHAT I'M DOING.

35
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,463
>> YOU'RE DIGGING YOUR OWN
GRAVE.

36
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,549
>> I'M GOING TO GET THIS OUT OF
THE WAY, ARE YOU GAY?

37
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,802
>> Jeff: SHANNON WAS VOTED OUT

38
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,721
LEAVING ALINA AND KELLY B.

39
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,140
IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.

40
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:39,849
18 ARE LEFT.

41
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,351
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

42
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:55,907
>> BLEW MY MIND.

43
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,534
>> THAT WAS CRAZY.

44
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,660
>> REGARDLESS OF WHO THINKS IT
OR NOT,

45
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:02,997
I THINK WE GOT RID OF THE RIGHT
PERSON FOR OUR TRIBE.

46
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,415
WE NEED TO GO BEAT THESE OLD
PEOPLE.

47
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,876
>> I THINK THE FEELINGS FOR EACH
OTHER ARE CLEAR,

48
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,212
I THINK WE JUST NEED TO WORK IT.

49
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,421
>> JEFF REALLY POINTED OUT WE'RE
NOT UNITED

50
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,049
AND IT WOULD BE COOL IF WE
FINALLY UNITED.

51
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:16,427
COMING BACK TO CAMP AFTER TRIBAL
COUNCIL WAS SO FAKE.

52
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:20,056
FAKER THAN FAUX FUR.

53
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:22,517
>> I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING A
LOT WAS AIRED OUT TONIGHT.

54
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,227
>> I AGREE.

55
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,604
>> EVERYBODY ACTING LIKE THEY
ALL COOL WITH EACH OTHER.

HAPPY FAMILY."

NO, WE'RE NOT BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN
DIVIDED.

58
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,696
SO ALINA, KELLY B.

59
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:38,867
AND JUD WERE IN PURE SHOCK

60
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,910
BECAUSE THEIR RINGLEADER SHANNON
IS GONE.

61
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,788
THEY HAD A PLAN AND IT DIDN'T
WORK, IT BACKFIRED.

OKAY.

WAY TO GO MARTY.

173
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,743
I'M THINKING HE'S A NICE GUY.

174
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:59,413
I WOULD HAVE KEPT IT FOR MYSELF
BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT US

175
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,790
CARRYING THAT KIND OF POWER
INTER A MERGE SITUATION,

176
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,501
WE BECOME INVINCIBLE.

177
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,627
>> BECAUSE IN FIVE ON FIVE,

178
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,963
THAT GIVES YOU YOUR ADVANTAGE,
BOOM, THERE YOU GO.

179
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,466
MARTY'S STOCK WENT WAY UP AFTER
THAT ANNOUNCEMENT.

180
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:11,801
JIMMY T.

181
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,011
WAS LIKE "WHAT A GREAT GUY, HE
DID THE RIGHT THING."

182
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,097
I THINK HE CAME OUT LOOKING

183
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,807
LIKE A SUPERSTAR SO IT'S GOOD
FOR ME IN THE LONG RUN.

184
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,811
THAT'S PRETTY COOL.

185
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,480
>> WHEN MARTY TOLD EVERYONE HE
FOUND THE IDOL,

186
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:27,483
MAYBE HE WANTED SOME INTEGRITY
POINTS, TEAM POINTS

187
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,819
BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD PERCEIVE IT
THAT, HEY, HE'S A TEAM PLAYER,

188
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,655
ON BOARD WITH WHAT WE'RE
PLANNING TO DO.

189
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,323
I THINK MARTY'S SHADY.

190
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,825
I THINK HE'S FOR SURE DOING HIS
OWN THING.

191
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,912
>> MARTY COULD HAVE EASILY KEPT
THAT IN HIS POCKET AND NOT TOLD

192
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,082
ANY OF US AND BEEN IN A HUGE
POSITION OF POWER INDIVIDUALLY.

193
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,001
HE JUST KEPT US STRONG AS A
TRIBE.

194
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,168
THANK YOU, MARTY.

195
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,712
I MEAN THAT.

196
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:48,963
>> IT WAS NOT GOING TO BE A
SECRET

197
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,381
FOR LONG THAT I HAD THE IDOL.

198
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,508
THE ONLY WAY TO PLAY IT WAS TO
MAKE IT APPEAR

199
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:55,845
AS SOMETHING FOR THE TRIBE TO
USE FOR THE BETTER GOOD

200
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,805
TO MOVE US ALL FORWARD, TO BE
STRONG.

201
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,850
BUT EVERYONE KNOW IT IS IDOL CAN
ONLY BELONG

202
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,893
TO ONE PERSON AND THAT ONE
PERSON IS ME.

203
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,165
>> I GO SEE JANE'S LAUNDRY
SERVICES

204
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,834
AND SHE'LL HAVE EVERYTHING DRY
IN 15 MINUTES.

205
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,836
NO CHARGE AND A SMILE.

206
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,257
>> I SLEPT MAYBE TWO HOURS.

207
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,759
HUNGRY.

208
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,761
NOT AS EASY AS I THOUGHT IT WAS
GOING TO BE.

209
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:39,722
I'M STARTING TO GET CONCERNED
THAT THIS TRIBE

210
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,931
MIGHT THINK I'M A WEAK LINK.

211
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:44,226
BUT I DON'T CONSIDER MYSELF A
WEAK LINK.

212
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,895
LISTEN, THIS IS THE THING I
SIGNED UP FOR

213
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:49,398
SO I'M JUST GOING TO GO WITH THE
FLOW.

214
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,775
I MEAN, I DO HAVE A BAD KNEE,
OKAY?

215
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:51,901
BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME WEAK.

216
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,903
I'M AS STRONG AS...

217
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,529
I'M NOT AS STRONG AS TYRONE,
OBVIOUSLY.

218
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,906
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY THAT.

219
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,908
THAT WOULD BE CRAZY.

220
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,242
BUT I'M AS STRONG AS ANY ONE OF
THE WOMEN,

221
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,995
EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THEM ARE
BUILT LIKE MOOSES.

222
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,916
>> CAN YOU MOVE THAT?

223
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,794
>> MOVING A LITTLE SLOW TODAY.

224
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,798
DANNY'S REALLY STRUGGLING.

225
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,384
I KNOW HE'S DOING A GOOD JOB
TRYING TO HIDE IT,

226
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:19,804
BUT HE'S JUST...
FOR WHATEVER REASON,

227
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,264
PHYSICALLY HE DOESN'T HAVE IT.

228
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,767
SO IN OUR NEXT CHALLENGE,
IF HE'S A ROCK STAR,

229
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,396
CLEARLY HE'S BEEN PLAYING US
ALL A SHOW.

230
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,398
BUT I DON'T THINK SO.

231
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:48,958
>> WHO DO YOU THINK
IS THE ONLY PERSON

232
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,960
WHO CAN SHAKE SOMETHING UP?

233
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,336
>> ALINA.

234
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,298
UNLESS, YOU KNOW, HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOLS COME INTO PLAY.

235
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,801
THE THING IS,
WITH ALINA AND KELLY B.,

236
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,970
WE HAVE AN OPTION RIGHT NOW.

237
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:05,433
SO IT'S NOT CLEAR-CUT WHICH ONE
WE WOULD VOTE FOR

238
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,143
UNTIL RIGHT BEFORE TRIBAL.

239
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,270
>> TRIBLA COUNCIL
DREW A LINE IN THE SAND

240
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:12,731
AND I ENDED UP ON THE WRONG SIDE
OF THE LINE.

241
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,817
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED
FABIO AND BEN IN THE CHALLENGES

242
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,862
SO KELLY B. AND I
ARE NOT IN THE BEST POSITION.

243
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:21,699
>> I TRUST US FIVE
AND THAT IS IT.

244
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,492
IF I HAD ANYTHING
TO SAY ABOUT IT

245
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,662
NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL WE'RE IN,
I'M DEFINITELY...

246
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,456
EITHER HER OR K.B.

247
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,958
BUT SHE STILL IS A BIGGER THREAT
JUST BECAUSE OF...

248
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,502
SHE WAS RIGHT ALONG WITH SHANNON
AND THE WHOLE DRAMA THING.

249
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,504
>> MY ALLIANCE RIGHT NOW IT IS

250
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:40,634
CHASE, BRENDA, SASH, MYSELF,
AND KELLY PURPLE.

251
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,345
THAT'S OUR STRONG FIVE AND WE'VE
GOT TO GET ALINA OUT OF HERE.

252
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,722
IF WE CAN GET ALINA OUT OF HERE,

253
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,474
WE'LL SEND A SHOCK WAVE
TO KELLY B.

254
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,476
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET, BITCHES.

255
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,985
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

256
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,036
OLDER TRIBE GETTING YOUR FIRST
LOOK AT THE NEW YOUNGER TRIBE.

257
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,079
SHANNON VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

258
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,544
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS READY TO GET
TO TODAY'S CHALLENGE?

259
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,879
>> YEAH.

260
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:17,880
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,

261
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,381
JIMMIE JOHNSON,
I WILL TAKE IT BACK.

262
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,425
>> FOR A SHORT TIME.

263
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:28,015
>> Jeff: ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS
BACK UP FOR GRABS.

264
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,601
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, BOTH
TRIBES WILL RACE OUT

265
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:34,063
INTO A FIELD TO COLLECT TEN
TRIBE-COLORED BARRELS.

266
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,898
ONCE YOU'VE COLLECTED
ALL TEN BARRELS,

267
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,901
YOU MUST ARRANGE THEM
ON INDIVIDUAL PLATFORMS.

268
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,111
THEN ONE PERSON AT A TIME
YOU WILL TOSS SANDBAGS

269
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:45,866
ATTEMPTING TO LAND THE SANDBAG
ON TOP OF THE BARREL.

270
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,409
FIRST TRIBE TO GET A SANDBAG

271
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,412
ON ALL TEN OF THEIR BARRELS
WINS IMMUNITY.

272
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,914
IS SAFE FROM THE VOTE.

273
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,082
LOSERS GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL

274
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,085
WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT
OF THIS GAME.

275
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,754
IN ADDITION,
YOU'RE PLAYING FOR REWARD.

276
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,092
(\CROWD GASPS\)

277
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,386
>> Jeff: IT'S A "SURVIVOR"
GARDEN.

278
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,346
YOU HAVE SAUCES AND SPICES,

279
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,432
FRUIT, YOU HAVE A SUSTAINABLE
HERB GARDEN.

280
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,934
WHATEVER YOU'RE ALREADY EATING,

281
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,144
THIS WILL CERTAINLY
IMPROVE THE TASTE.

282
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,814
NOW TO THE MEDALLION OF POWER.

283
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:17,606
YOUNGER TRIBE, YOU HAVE IT.

284
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,108
IF YOU USE
THE MEDALLION OF POWER,

285
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,111
YOUR ADVANTAGE WILL BE
THAT TWO OF YOUR TEN BARRELS

286
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,573
WILL BE OUT OF THE FIELD
ON THEIR PLATFORM

287
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,908
WITH A SANDBAG ON TOP.

288
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:31,245
GIVE YOU A MOMENT
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

289
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,788
>> I THINK WE CAN DO IT
WITHOUT IT.

290
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:34,790
>> Jeff: YOUNGER TRIBE, ARE YOU
GOING TO USE IT OR NOT?

291
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:35,791
>> NOPE.

292
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:36,917
>> Jeff: NOT GOING TO USE IT.

293
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,420
YOUNGER TRIBE NOT GONNA USE
THE MEDALLION OF POWER,

294
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,755
GIVING UP A HUGE ADVANTAGE
IN THIS CHALLENGE.

295
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,965
>> WE'RE JUST PRETTY CONFIDENT

296
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,759
THAT WE CAN TAKE THEM
WITHOUT USING IT.

297
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:46,468
>> Jeff: THIS CHALLENGE WILL
PLAY STRAIGHT UP.

298
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,262
GIVE YOU A MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE.

299
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,346
GET STARTED.

300
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,974
>> THE MOST AGILE GUY, START
WITH THIS FIRST BARREL

301
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,310
AND GO GET THE WATER BARREL.

302
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,644
>> I'LL GET THIS ONE BACK HERE.

303
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,478
I'M GETTING THIS ONE
BY THE TREE.

304
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,981
>> OKAY, I'LL GET THIS ONE,
THEN.

305
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,357
>> WHO'S GOOD ON TOSSING?

306
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,026
>> THREE OR FOUR, FIVE TOSSES

307
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:05,112
AND THEN YOU ROTATE TO THE NEXT
AND PUT THE NEXT TOSS.

308
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,989
>> START OFF WITH TY, FIRST.

309
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,366
>> IF SOMEONE GETS
ON A HOT STREAK...

310
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,368
>> I THINK EVERYONE
SHOULD TRY IT.

311
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,246
>> ONE, TWO, THREE, ESPADA!

312
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,043
>> Jeff: HERE WE GO, FOR
IMMUNITY AND REWARD,

313
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,128
SURVIVORS READY?

314
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,130
GO!

315
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,222
>> Jeff: GOT TO GET ALL TEN
BARRELS BACK BY ROLLING THEM.

316
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:38,520
EVERYBODY ON A BARREL.

317
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,190
YOUNGER TRIBE HAS TWO BACK.

318
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,193
YOUNGER TRIBE HAS THREE BACK.

319
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,236
HERE COME A BUNCH OF BARRELS
FOR THE OLDER TRIBE.

320
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,742
ONCE YOU GET ALL TEN
OVER THE LINE,

321
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,327
YOU CAN START STACKING THEM.

322
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,328
>> OVER THE LINE!

323
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,663
>> Jeff: GO YOUNGER TRIBE.

324
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,123
OLDER TRIBE WITH
ONE BARREL LEFT.

325
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,710
START STACKING THEM,
OLDER TRIBE!

326
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,130
YOUNGER TRIBE OFF
TO A VERY FAST START.

327
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,340
>> COME ON!

328
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,175
>> Jeff: OLDER TRIBE,
YOU NEED TO PICK IT UP!

329
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,218
YOU'RE WALTZING THROUGH THIS!

330
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,428
IT IS A RACE!

331
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,472
SOMEBODY GOING HOME TONIGHT.

332
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:16,433
DAN, YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING!

333
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,061
GET ALL TEN BARRELS
ON THIER PLATFORMS!

334
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,397
EVERYBODY ON THE MAT.

335
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,232
ON THE MAT BEFORE
YOU START THROWING.

336
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:27,027
>> GO, GO, GO!

337
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,571
>> Jeff: YOUNGER TRIBE STARTING
TO TOSS BAGS.

338
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,781
>> GOT IT!

339
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:34,243
>> Jeff: BENRY LANDS THE FIRST
BAG FOR THE YOUNGER TRIBE.

340

TYRONE LANDS THE FIRST BAG FOR
THE OLDER TRIBE.

341
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,248
>> YES, BENRY!

342
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,542
KEEP GOING!

343
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,711
>> Jeff: BENRY LANDS A SECOND
BAG FOR THE YOUNGER TRIBE.

344
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,088
TYRONE LANDS A SECOND BAG FOR
THE OLDER TRIBE.

345
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,215

346
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:54,555

354
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,488
>> Jeff: TYRONE WITH A FIFTH BAG

355
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,742
YOUNGER TRIBE QUICKLY FALLING
BEHIND IN THIS CHALLENGE.

356
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,161
>> LET BENRY GO BACK.

357
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:21,582

362
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,965

00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:37,765

368
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,349
>> Jeff: YOUNGER TRIBE

NICE!

374
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,984

00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,989
TYRONE MISSES.

378
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:56,450
BENRY PUTS THE YOUNGER TRIBE

379
00:17:56,533 --> 00:18:00,245
YOUNGER TRIBE LEADS 7-6.

380
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,539
MAKE IT 8-6.

381
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,500
TWO BARRELS LEFT
FOR THE YOUNGER TRIBE.

382
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,668
>> TYRONE, YOU NEED TO MOVE.

383
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,837
>> TAKE A BREAK, T.D.,
LET SOMEBODY GET A SHOT.

384

386
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,343
THESE TWO BARRELS RIGHT HERE,

387
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:19,681
HAVE THEY TAKEN THE ADVANTAGE,
THIS CHALLENGE WOULD BE OVER.

388

00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,231
YOU'RE WASTING ME.

393
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,525

00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:58,720

00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,222
(\SCREAMING\).

409
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,098

411
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,101
>> COME ON, J.T .

412
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,604

00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,647
(\CHEERS AND APPLAUSE\)

414
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,900
>> Jeff: YOUNGER SIDE WINS
IMMUNITY AND REWARD!

415
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,654
(\CHEERS AND APPLAUSE\)

416
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:16,613
>> OH, MY GOD!

417
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,614
>> NICE!

418
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,615

00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:24,413
(\APPLAUSE\)

420
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,248
>> Jeff: YOUNGER TRIBE,
CONGRATULATIONS.

421
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:31,753
(\APPLAUSE\)

422
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,464
YOU DECIDED NOT TO USE THE
MEDALLION OF POWER,

423
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,632
YOU DIDN'T NEED IT,

424
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,718
BENRY, YOU DOMINATED
THIS CHALLENGE

425
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,803
AND WON IT FOR
THE YOUNGER TRIBE.

426
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,054
NOW YOU HAVE
THE MEDALLION OF POWER

427
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,097
TO USE AT THE NEXT CHALLENGE

428
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,933
AND YOU ALSO KEEP THE OLDER
TRIBE FROM USING IT.

429
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:45,934
CONGRATULATIONS.

430
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,104
COME GET YOUR REWARD
AND HEAD ON BACK TO CAMP.

431
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:50,105
>> OH, MY GOD!

432
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:53,775
>> I'LL GET THE SAUCES.

433
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,986
>> AFTER WE WON THE CHALLENGE, I
WENT RIGHT FOR THE FRUIT BASKET

434
00:19:56,069 --> 00:20:00,574
AND I COULD SEE THE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL CLUE.

435
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:04,286
I GRABBED UP ONE SIDE AND
I SAW IT RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM

436
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,537
AND THEN I SAW NAY
LOOKING DOWN, TOO,

437
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,290
AND I WAS LIKE, OH, SHOOT,
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

438
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,458
>> KELLY B. SHE WAS SCARED,

439
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,002
I COULD SEE
THE LITTLE WHEELS TURNING.

440
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,128
SHE'S PROBABLY LIKE, "DANG.

441
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:16,632
OF ALL PEOPLE, WHY DID IT HAVE
TO BE NAONKA TO SEE IT."

442
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,800
SO I HAD TO COME UP
WITH A GAME PLAN.

443
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,469
AS SOON AS WE GET BACK TO
OUR HOME, I'M GOING FOR IT.

444
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:24,473
DAMN THE FRUIT, I'M GOING
STRAIGHT FOR THE PAPER.

445
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,642
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, THE RESULT,

446
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,018
ANOTHER LOSS
FOR THE OLDER TRIBE,

447
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,019
SOMEBODY ELSE FROM THIS TRIBE

448
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,313
WILL BE VOTED OUT AT TONIGHT'S
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

449
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,148
YOU HAVE THE AFTERNOON TO FIGURE
OUT WHO IT'S GOING TO BE.

450
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:34,358
GRAB YOUR STUFF,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP,

451
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,401
I'LL SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.

452
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,810
>> WHOA, WHOA!

453
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,186
>> WOW.

454
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:12,354
>> YUP.

455
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,355
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

456
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:13,981
>> WHAT IS THAT ABOUT?

457
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:14,690
>> LEAVING THE CHALLENGE,

458
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,483
I WASN'T GOING TO LET KELLY B.

459
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,651
OUT OF MY SIGHT AT ALL.

460
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,486
SO I'M WATCHING HER,
SHE LOOKS AT ME

461
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,947
AND I'M LOOKING AT HER LIKE
YEAH, I SEE YOU.

462
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,323
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

463
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,325
YOU THINK I'M ABOUT
TO TAKE MY EYES OFF OF IT.

464
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,327
>> SORRY ABOUT SMUSHING
YOUR BANANAS.

465
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,829
I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.

466
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,665
THAT PAPER WAS BASICALLY
LIKE A MILLION DOLLARS.

467
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,750
THAT'S THE LIFELINE
IN THIS GAME.

468
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,544
GETTING A CLUE,
THAT'S THE LIFELINE.

469
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,712
>> THERE WAS A NOTE?

470
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,421
COME ON, FABIO!

471
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,548
>> THAT'S WHY SHE JUST...

472
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,507
>> KNOCKED HER DOWN
AND GOT CLUE.

473
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,550
GOT A NOTE.

474
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,552
>> AND YOU SMUSH
ALL THE BANANAS?

475
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:47,014
>> THAT SUCKS SO BAD.

476
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,349
>> NAONKA AND I WERE CARRYING
THE FRUIT BASKET IN

477
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,185
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW,
SHE JUST PUMMELED ME.

478
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,812
JUST PUSHED ME OUT OF THE WAY.

479
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,356
SHE WENT AFTER THE CLUE
AND THEN KIND OF WANDERED OFF.

480
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,525
I WAS PISSED BECAUSE ALINA AND I

481
00:21:58,608 --> 00:21:59,568
REALLY NEED
THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

482
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,279
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT, MAN.

483
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,405
>> COMPLETELY UNCALLED FOR.

484
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,698
>> I'M JUST GETTING SICK OF IT.

485
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:08,618
>> I SAW THEM TALKING "THAT
BITCH NAONKA, SHE GOT THE CLUE."

486
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,620
AND I KNOW ALINE IS MAKING THEM
SEEM LIKE

487
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,415
"SHE JUST PUSHED ME OUT OF THE
WAY, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW

488
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,916
WHAT WAS GOING ON!"

489
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,084
GO AHEAD, BE A FOOL, BECAUSE IF

490
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,545
IT HAPPENS AGAIN I'LL PULL YOU
AGAIN.

491
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:22,257
AND I'LL PUSH YOU SO HARD THAT
DAMN LEG WILL FLY OFF.

492
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,426
"THIS A CLUE TO A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

493
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,927
IT'S UP TO YOU WHETHER YOU SHARE
THIS INFORMATION

494
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,054
WITH ANYONE ELSE.

495
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:30,432
DECIPHER THE CLUES TO FIND THE
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL."

496
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,726
IT'S GOING TO TAKE ME FOREVER TO
FIGURE THIS OUT.

497
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,644
YOU COULD SAY I GOT 'HOOD.

498
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,604
I SURE DID.

499
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,939
I GOT 'HOOD.

500
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,441
I DIDN'T GET GHETTO.

501
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,610
GHETTO WOULD HAVE BEEN "GIRL,
YOU KNOW I HAD TO WHOOP THAT

502
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:45,155
AND GET THAT, GIRL, YOU
TRIPPING, GIRL, UH-UH, GIRL."

503
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,282
NO, I JUST WHOOP!

504
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:48,742
IT'S THE GAME, IT'S THE GAME.

505
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,118
SHE HAS ONE LEG.

506
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,912
DON'T THINK THAT I'M GONNA BE
NICE TO YOU

507
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,413
BECAUSE YOU HAVE ONE LEG.

508
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,248
I'M NOT GONNA WHERE NICE TO YOU.

509
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,542
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING.
MY NAME IS NAONKA, NOT FOOL.

510
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,385
>> YOU WANT TO SEE IT?

511
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,387
>> SURE.

512
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,146
>> "DECIPHER THE CLUES TO FIND
IT."

513
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,483
EQUALS WEST TREE?

514
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,609
SUNSET TREE?

515
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,486
>> SO WE KNOW IT'S OVER THERE
WAY SOMEWHERE.

516
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:28,115
>> WELL IT'S EIGHT STEPS WEST OF
SOMETHING.

517
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:28,698
>> I'M GETTING THROWN BECAUSE
THERE'S FEET HERE

518
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,784
AND AN ARM HERE.

519
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:31,868
>> ELBOW.

520
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:35,539
NAY SHOWED IT TO ME AND I THINK
SHE'S...

521
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,666
I'M THE ONLY PERSON SHE SHOWED.

522
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,668
I JUST KEEP THINKING ABOUT IT
AND THINKING ABOUT IT.

523
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,670
ONCE WE SEE WE'LL START
DEDUCTING.

524
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,213
DAMN THAT TREE LOOKS OBVIOUS.

525
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:46,216
SHE DEFINITELY IN MY EYES THAT
HAS POWER RIGHT NOW,

526
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:49,344
I'M KEEPING AS TIGHT WITH HER AS
POSSIBLE.

527
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,638
THANK GOD IT'S NOT IN ALINA AND
K.B.'S HANDS.

528
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:55,517
>> ALINA, SHE SHOULD BE SHAKING
LIKE A LEAF ON ONE BRANCH

529
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,603
AND THAT'S THE ONLY LEAF THERE
HANGING ON FOR DEAR LIFE.

530
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,705
>> THE CHALLENGE TODAY WAS
PRETTY MUCH OF A DISASTER.

531
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,748
WE ENDED UP LOSING BOTH REWARD
AND IMMUNITY.

532
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,542
IS NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE TO GO TO
TRIBAL COUNCIL,

533
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:24,171
THEY WALKED OFF WITH A WHOLE
MESS OF BANANAS AND SPICES

534
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,715
AND IT WAS PRETTY TOUGH TO TAKE.

535
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,676
>> I'M GOING TO SPEAK MY MIND
ONE LITTLE PIECE

536
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,469
TO THE WHOLE TRIBE WHILE WE'RE
ALL HERE.

537
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,597
I REALLY FEEL LIKE I GOT SOME
TALENT ARE BEING WASTED.

538
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,724
COACH, EVALUATE ME.

539
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,893
AS YOU LOOK AT ME A LITTLE
BETTER I GOT SKILLED.

540
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,228
AND IF YOU LEAVE THEM ON THE
BENCH,

541
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:44,065
IT'S GOING TO COST US.

542
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,943
THE GUYS THAT ARE THE LEADERS
ARE SQUELCHING ME

543
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:50,614
BECAUSE I'M AN OBVIOUS LEADER
AND THEY KNOW IT.

544
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:51,865
IF THESE PEOPLE KNEW WHAT THEY
WERE DOING,

545
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,241
I WOULD BE THE LEADER OF THIS
TRIBE

546
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,451
AND I WOULD LEAD THEM WELL.

547
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:57,078
RIGHT NOW, JIMMY JOHNSON, HE MAY
BE CATCHING UP WITH DANNY

548
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,538
IN THE USELESS DEPARTMENT.

549
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,707
JUST MY OPINION, I'M NOT ASKING
FOR TOO MUCH,

550
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,084
I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M BEING
WASTED.

551
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,753
I'VE ALWAYS HAD A HIGH OPINION
OF MYSELF AS YOU ALL KNOW

552
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:08,757
FROM PAST PERFORMANCES AND I
KNOW I'M KIND OF A SHOW BOAT.

553
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,218
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T HAVE
VALUE IN THESE CHALLENGES.

554
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,135
AND WE SHOULD ALL...

555
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,930
>> I THINK IT'S OBVIOUSLY
DISAPPOINTING.

556
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,890
I THINK TYRONE YOU HAD AN
AWESOME TEAR BUT THEN,

557
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,267
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A BUNCH OF
MISSES IN THE ROW.

558
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,602
>> AFTER I DID THE ONES I DID,
THEY PROGRESSIVELY GOT HARDER

559
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,230
BECAUSE THEY WERE FURTHER,
OBVIOUSLY,

560
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,398
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE AN ISSUE
STEPPING OUT.

561
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:28,735
>> YOU ARE NUMBER-ONE GUY SO WE
WANTED TO START WITH YOU.

562
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:32,280
AND SO YOU STARTED MISSING THEM
SO THAT'S

563
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,448
WHEN I PUT J.T.
IN THERE FOR A FEW SHOTS.

564
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:34,491
YOU MADE ONE.

565
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:35,450
>> I DID HELP.

566
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:39,454
>> TYRONE, IF I MAY, KEEPING IT
REAL HERE,

567
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:42,624
YOU DID HAVE A BIG LONG COLD
SPELL BEFORE HE TOOK YOU OUT

568
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,334
AND EVEN WHEN HE DID WAS CALLING
YOU,

569
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,670
CALLED YOU SEVERAL TIMES AND YOU
DIDN'T WANT TO COME OUT.

570
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,421
YOU HAVE TO BE A TEAM PLAYER,
TOO.

571
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,464
>> TRUST ME, IT'S NOT ABOUT ME.

572
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,799
I JUST WANT TO WIN.

573
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:54,135
SOME PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK I WAS
MAD BECAUSE I GOT PULLED OUT.

574
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,596
NO, I WAS COOL WITH THE
ROTATION, WHATEVER.

575
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,181
IT WAS JUST DO WE WANT TO WIN OR
DO WE WANT

576
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,933
EVERYBODY TO TOUCH THE BALL?

577
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,518
YOU KNOW?

578
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,812
EVERYBODY CAN'T TOUCH THE BALL
ALL THE TIME IF YOU WANT TO WIN.

579
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,481
IT'S NOT LITTLE LEAGUE WHERE
EVERY KID GETS

580
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:08,275
TO PLAY "X"
AMOUNT OF INNINGS.

581
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:12,654
IT'S NOT.

582
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,989
>> YOU HAD OVER 50 SHOTS.

583
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,031
AND YOU STARTED MISSING THEM.

584
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,826
WE PUT J.T. IN AND I THINK
THAT WAS A GOOD MOVE.

585
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,288
>> OKAY, VERY GOOD.

586
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:24,291
>> I JUST THOUGHT WE COULD HAVE
PLANNED IT OUT A LITTLE BETTER.

587
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,542
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

588
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,670
TRUST ME. IT'S NOT
ABOUT TYRONE DAVIS.

589
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,839
ALL I WANT TO DO IS WIN.

590
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,173
>> WE ALL...

591
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,800
THAT'S ALL WE ALL WANT
TO DO, WIN.

592
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:36,177
>> OKAY.

593
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,722
>> IT WAS A HEATED DISCUSSION
AND KIND OF ENJOYABLE

594
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,141
JUST TO WATCH
A LITTLE BIT OF TENSION

595
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:42,684
FOR A CHANGE IN THIS TRIBE.

596
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:46,896
I HATE TO SAY IT BUT I'M LOOKING
FORWARD TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

597
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,815
WE'RE FINALLY GOING TO GET
THIS TRIBE TO PLAY THIS GAME.

598
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:51,818
THIS IS REAL AND IT STARTS NOW.

599
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,896
>> I THINK HE'S TRYING
IN HIS OWN LITTLE WAY.

600
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,065
HIS KNEES AND HIS BACK,
YOU KNOW, HE'S...

601
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,233
HE'S IN TOUGH SHAPE, YOU KNOW?

602
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:36,237
>> WELL, Y'ALL GOT
TO HAVE A STRONG TEAM.

603
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,073
>> I'M WORRIED
ABOUT JIMMY JOHNSON.

604
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,574
I THINK HE'S FULL OF IT.

605
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:42,410
I MEAN, JUST PLAYING LIKE,
HEY, I'M NOT GOING TO WIN.

606
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,912
I DON'T BUY THAT.

607
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:47,874
SO I NEED TO REMOVE HIM SO THAT
PEOPLE WILL LOSE THEIR DADDY.

608
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:52,545
THEY'LL EITHER SHAKE AND CRUMBLE
OR THEY'LL HAVE TO COME TO ME.

609
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,733
>> NO, I'M GOOD. WHATEVER.

610
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,985
IN MY MIND, DANNY, COACH AND
HOLLY ARE THE SAME PERSON.

611
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,946
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT ORDER.

612
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,614
>> I DISAGREE.

613
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:22,617
I THINK HE'S MORE STRATEGIC THAN
EITHER ONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS.

614
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,953
HE NEEDS TO GO FIRST.

615
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,038
>> YOU COME TO ME
AND TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

616
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,790
THE WAY I SEE IT,
DANNY, COACH AND HOLLY

617
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,959
ARE ALL EQUALLY WEAK PLAYERS.

618
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:34,295
MARTY FOR SOME REASON
SEES JIMMY AS A THREAT.

619
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,465
SOMEHOW HE THINKS JIMMY'S GOING
TO WEASEL OR WORM

620
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,758
HIS WAY INTO THE MERGE.

621
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:42,011
I DON'T REALLY FOLLOW
HIS LOGIC OR REASONING.

622
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,638
AND TO BE HONEST,
I WOULD PREFER DAN

623
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:46,766
BECAUSE I THINK
HE'S PHYSICALLY THE WEAKEST.

624
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,476
BUT HE'S LIKE, NO,
NO, COACH IS DANGEROUS.

625
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,478
I WAS LIKE, "WHATEVER."

626
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,020
YOU'RE THE PUPPET MASTER.

627
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:51,938
>> ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

628
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,940
NO MORE TALK ABOUT IT, THEN.

629
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:09,205
>> MARTY AND I ARE VERY SOLID.

630
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,167
I THINK THE NEXT ONE TO GO
IS GOING TO BE JIMMY.

631
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,460
I MEAN, YOU'VE SEEN HIM.

632
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:14,669
I'M IN MUCH BETTER SHAPE.

633
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:18,840
I'M IN MUCH, MUCH, MUCH BETTER
PHYSICAL SHAPE THAN HE IS.

634
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,508
SO WHEN THE SMOKE CLEARS
TONIGHT,

635
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,803
WE'LL KNOW WHETHER I GO HOME
OR JIMMY GOES HOME.

636
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,013
>> ARE WE STICKING TO THE PLAN
OF THE SAME...

637
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:28,516
>> YEAH.

638
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,351
GOT ANY SUGGESTIONS?

639
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,061
>> WELL, DO YOU?

640
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,062
>> (\LAUGHS\)

641
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,356
>> FOR ME IT'S KIND OF OBVIOUS,
I DON'T KNOW.

642
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,858
WE'RE PROBABLY TALKING
THE SAME THING?

643
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,943
>> I FEEL BAD FOR THE GUY
BECAUSE I LIKE HIM

644
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,738
BUT COACH IT IS FOR ME.

645
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:45,074
HE WAS NEVER A BIG JIMMY T.
FAN ANYWAY.

646
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:48,870
>> COOL.

647
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,539
THERE'S SOME PEOPLE
THAT ARE DEFINITELY SMART.

648
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,208
ACTUALLY, NOT THAT MANY.

649
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,084
BUT I'VE GOT THE STRATEGY.

650
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,879
JIMMY J.'S GOT TO GO FIRST

651
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,340
AND IT WILL SHAKE THE TRIBE
TO ITS CORE.

652
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:03,176
I'VE GOT DANNY SQUARED AWAY
AND I'VE GOT JIMMY T.

653
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,220
I'VE GOT JILL,
SHE TOTALLY DEFERS TO ME.

654
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,181
PEOPLE LIKE JANE AND HOLLY,
I MEAN,

655
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,058
LOOK AT JIMMY JOHNSON
AS IF HE WERE THE POPE.

656
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,519
SO THAT...

657
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,271
JUST PEOPLE BEING STUPID.

658
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:27,784
>> DAMN I WANTED A PIECE
OF PINEAPPLE AND BANANA.

659
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,077
>> I KNOW MY HEAD'S ON
THE CHOPPING BLOCK FOR TONIGHT.

660
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:34,415
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

661
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,960
>> NOBODY BROUGHT UP MY NAME?

662
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,253
SO YOU'RE SAYING
IF MY NAME COMES UP

663
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,254
YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME?

664
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,047
>> I WILL TELL YOU.

665
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,383
>> SO WHO ARE YOU WRITING DOWN?

666
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:46,219
>> I HAVE A FEELING
IT MIGHT BE DANNY.

667
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,387
>> WHO?

668
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,598
>> DANNY.

669
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,934
I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE
THE WEAKEST PLAYER GO HOME.

670
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:56,604
I DON'T KNOW IF DANNY'S HAVING
THAT GREAT OF A TIME.

671
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,941
HE'S GOT AN INJURED LEG, OKAY?

672
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:03,403
SPIRITS ARE GETTING A LITTLE LOW
WITH THE LACK OF FOOD.

673
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:06,239
COACH IS KIND OF
MY FISHING BUDDY,

674
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,616
SO I REALLY DON'T WANT HIM TO GO
AT THIS POINT.

675
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,411
I REALLY DON'T WANT DAN TO GO
EITHER,

676
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,746
BUT WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

677
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,123
I DO NOT LIKE GOING
TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

678
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,584
HATE IT.

679
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,586
(\LAUGHS\)

680
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:32,765
>> OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

681
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:33,766
>> BUT...

682
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,434
>> I HOPE NOT, COACH.

683
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:37,312
>> IT'S BEEN AN EXPERIENCE.

684
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,980
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

685
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,983
>> YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

686
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,027
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

687
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,322
I SAID ALL ALONG I JUST WANT ONE
OF Y'ALL TO WIN A MILLION BUCKS.

688
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,949
>> I KNOW, BUT YOU'RE LIKE
MY FAVORITE PERSON HERE.

689
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,827
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU GO.

690
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:56,164
>> I'M IN TROUBLE EVERY SINGLE
WEEK WE GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

691
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,166
I KNOW THAT.

692
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,668
I THINK I'M GOING
TO GO BACK UP THERE.

693
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:04,505
>> OKAY.

694
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,382
>> I WANT TO KEEP
PLAYING THE GAME.

695
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,176
IT'S THE TOUGHEST THING
I'VE EVER GONE THROUGH.

696
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,511
I'VE GONE THROUGH TWO A DAY
PRACTICES,

697
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,973
THREE A DAY PRACTICES, BOTH
AS A COACH AND AS A PLAYER,

698
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,642
AND NOTHING COMPARES TO THIS.

699
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,353
NOTHING COMPARES TO IT.

700
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,211
>> MARTY'S PARANOID.

701
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,922
I THINK THAT MARTY'S VERY MUCH
ABOUT MARTY.

702
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,383
I HAVEN'T MADE UP MY MIND YET,
BUT JIMMY JOHNSON'S LIFE

703
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,218
HAS BEEN ABOUT MOTIVATING
AND LEADING MEN.

704
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,053
I'M WORRIED
ABOUT DANNY'S PHYSICAL ABILITY

705
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,097
TO HELP THE TEAM.

706
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,182
DUDE GOT AILMENTS.

707
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:59,852
YOU RAISE SOME VALID POINTS
FOR SURE.

708
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,562
BUT IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE BECAUSE
I GOT SOME OTHER PEOPLE.

709
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,647
>> ALL RIGHT.

710
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,691
THERE'S SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE
KIND OF SHYING AWAY

711
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,651
FROM MAKING THE TOUGH CALLS.

712
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,194
TYRONE'S ANSWER WAS NOWHERE NEAR
WHAT I NEEDED IT TO BE.

713
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:11,781
IT SHOWS HE'S NOT THINKING
THIS GAME THROUGH AT ALL.

714
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:14,367
I THINK THAT'S A HUGE MISTAKE.

715
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,371
I'D LIKE JIMMY JOHNSON GONE,

716
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,540
AND THOSE THAT WANT TO PLAY
WITH ME AND WANT TO PLAY ALONG,

717
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:21,749
JUMP ON BOARD.

718
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,042
DO NOT MESS AROUND WITH ME.

719
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,252
I MEAN, I'M PLAYING THIS GAME
FOR REAL,

720
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,045
AND I'M PLAYING
A SMART GAME HERE.

721
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,797
I JUST HOPE IT ALL GOES THE WAY
I'M PLANNING,

722
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,965
'CAUSE THIS IS
WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN,

723
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:31,384
AND IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN NOW.

724
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,779
>> Jeff: LET'S TALK ABOUT
TODAY'S CHALLENGE, MARTY.

725
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,072
WHAT HAPPENED?

726
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,324
>> WE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF LEAD
GOING INTO IT, LOST SOME GROUND

727
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,618
AND JUST COULDN'T PULL IT
THROUGH AT THE END.

728
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,286
>> Jeff: JIMMY T.,
WAS THERE ANY FRUSTRATION

729
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,455
ABOUT HOW THINGS WENT DOWN?

730
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,457
WE SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS?
WE COULD HAVE DONE THAT?

731
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,750
>> WELL, AS IS MY WAY,

732
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,460
I ALWAYS WANT
A LITTLE MORE PLAY TIME,

733
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,628
SO I TOLD THE COACH
RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

734
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,463
THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WITH ME
FOR A WEEK,

735
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,465
I THINK
THEY HAVE SEEN MY SKILL SET,

736
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,924
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY

737
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,010
I'M NOT GETTING A LITTLE MORE
COURT TIME, IF YOU WILL.

738
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,220
>> Jeff: SO YOU LITERALLY WENT
TO JIMMY JOHNSON,

739
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,973
AND SAID "PUT ME IN COACH,
I'M READY TO PLAY?"

740
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:20,475
>> OH, DURING THE GAME,
I WAS, LIKE,

741
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,185
"YOU'RE WASTING ME HERE, COACH.
YOU'RE WASTING ME HERE."

742
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,311
AND I THINK HE KNEW IT,
AND THAT'S WHY HE DID PUT ME IN.

743
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,855
HE KNOWS I GOT GAME.

744
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,940
>> Jeff: SO, JILL, IT SOUNDS
LIKE YOU GUYS ARE RELYING

745
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,276
ON JIMMY JOHNSON FOR SOME
STRATEGY AT THESE CHALLENGES.

746
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,988
>> I MEAN, EVERYBODY HERE IS
A LEADER IN THEIR OWN FIELD,

747
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:36,324
WANTS TO PLAY,
WANTS TO GO GET HIM,

748
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,326
AND SOMETIMES
THAT DOESN'T ALL GEL.

749
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,828
SO, I GUESS HE'S THE MOST
ACCOMPLISHED LEADER

750
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,830
OF ALL OF US,
SO WE OFTEN LOOK TO HIM.

751
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,332
>> Jeff: SO, JIMMY, IS YOUR
BIGGEST CONTRIBUTION

752
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:47,794
HELPING FORM THE STRATEGY
OF THE CHALLENGE?

753
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,837
>> I DON'T THINK
I'M REALLY FORMING THE STRATEGY

754
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:50,880
OF THE CHALLENGE.

755
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,298
I THINK I'M LISTENING TO THEM

756
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,801
AND LETTING THEM
MAKE THE CONTRIBUTION.

757
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:58,012
THE OTHER CONTRIBUTION I MAKE
IS, I HELP WITH THE FISHING,

758
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,890
AND IN THE CHALLENGES, THEY KNOW
I'M GOING TO GIVE IT ALL.

759
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,683
>> Jeff:
HOLLY, GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE

760
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,019
OF JIMMY JOHNSON'S
LEADERSHIP SKILLS.

761
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,980
>> I THINK THERE'S BEEN
MANY TIMES HE STEPS FORWARD,

762
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,857
AND WHEN WE'RE AROUND
THE CAMPFIRE,

763
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,400
THERE'S TIMES WHERE HE'LL SAY,

764
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:12,610
"OKAY, WE NEED
TO HAVE A TEAM MEETING."

765
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:16,739
HE TRIES TO BOOST THE MORALE
AS MUCH AS HE POSSIBLY CAN.

766
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,866
>> Jeff: JIMMY T.,
YOU LIT UP AND STARTED SMILING.

767
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,244
>> I WAS JUST ANXIOUS TO HEAR
WHAT THE ANSWER WAS GOING TO BE.

768
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,829
>> Jeff: REALLY? JUST EXCITED

769
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:23,371
TO HEAR
WHAT HOLLY HAD TO SAY, HUH?

770
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,873
I GOT TO ASK.

771
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,834
HOW ARE YOU GETTING ALONG
WITH JIMMY JOHNSON?

772
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,877
>> WELL, I DON'T THINK ME
AND JIMMY HAVE HAD A CHANCE

773
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:30,711
TO REALLY SIT DOWN AND TALK.

774
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,713
I KNOW HE NEVER
REALLY APPROACHED ME,

775
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,381
AND I NEVER REALLY
APPROACHED HIM.

776
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,633
>> Jeff: HOW IS IT POSSIBLE,

777
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,343
EIGHT DAYS
OF LIVING TOGETHER OUT HERE,

778
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:41,055
THAT YOU HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE
TO SPEAK?

779
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:43,891
CELEBRITY ALONE
WOULD MAKE MOST PEOPLE SAY,

780
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,351
"I'D LIKE TO TALK
TO JIMMY JOHNSON."

781
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,520
>> OF COURSE
I'M A BIG FOOTBALL FAN

782
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,730
AND A PATRIOTS
SEASON TICKETHOLDER.

783
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,815
BUT, UM, I DON'T KNOW.

784
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,275
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I'M A THREAT
TO HIS LEADERSHIP ROLE

785
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,610
BECAUSE I AM A LEADER
WHERE I COME FROM,

786
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:57,530
AND I AM ASSERTIVE,
OFTEN SPEAKING MY MIND,

787
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,740
AND MAYBE HE DIDN'T WANT
TO BE BOTHERED WITH THAT.

788
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:00,616
IT COULD BE THAT SIMPLE.

789
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,035
>> Jeff: TYRONE,
WHAT'S THAT LOOK FOR?

790
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,455
>> I... THAT'S...
KIND OF BAFFLING TO ME.

791
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:10,668
THINKS HE MAY BE A THREAT
TO HIS LEADERSHIP ROLE.

792
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,628
I JUST FOUND THAT INTERESTING.

793
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,422
>> Jeff: JIMMY JOHNSON,
ARE YOU THREATENED BY JIMMY T.?

794
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,300
>> NO, AND, ACTUALLY,
I FEEL LIKE

795
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,552
I'VE GOT A GREAT RELATIONSHIP
WITH JIMMY T.

796
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,429
WE NEVER HAVE SAT DOWN
ONE ON ONE

797
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,972
AND HAD LONG CONVERSATIONS,

798
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:26,767
BUT I'VE ALWAYS FELT
IT'S BEEN A GREAT RELATIONSHIP.

799
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,395
>> Jeff: SO, JILL,
YOU'VE LOST THIS CHALLENGE.

800
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,272
HOW MUCH DOES THAT WEIGH
ON YOUR MIND

801
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,481
AS THE TRIBE IS GETTING SMALLER
AND SMALLER?

802
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,734
>> IT WEIGHS A LOT

803
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,444
'CAUSE WE'RE GOING UP
AGAINST REALLY YOUNG,

804
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,945
STRONG-LOOKING PLAYERS,

805
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,196
AND I THINK
THAT'S OUR MOTIVATION

806
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,407
FOR NEEDING THE STRONGEST TRIBE
POSSIBLE TO GO UP AGAINST THEM.

807
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:45,620
>> Jeff: DAN, WHAT ABOUT YOU
IS STRONG IN THIS GAME?

808
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:46,287
>> I THINK I'M AVERAGE.

809
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,456
I'M NOT THE TOP OF THE LADDER,

810
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,790
BUT I'M NOT THE BOTTOM
OF THE LADDER.

811
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,627
>> Jeff: JILL, IS THAT TRUE?

812
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,964
>> WELL, SOMETIMES, AROUND CAMP,
DAN SEEMS A LITTLE STIFF,

813
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,175
AND MAYBE HAVING PROBLEMS
LIKE GETTING UP.

814
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:02,178
SO, BEING AN OLDER COMPETITOR,
IT'S, LIKE, YOU KNOW,

815
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,429
ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE
TO BRING IT DURING A CHALLENGE?

816
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:07,767
>> Jeff: JANE, DO YOU NOTICE
DAN STRUGGLING TO GET UP,

817
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,936
BEING A LITTLE STIFF,
AS JILL MENTIONED?

818
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,355
>> HE'S GOT A BIG SCAR
ON ONE OF HIS KNEES,

819
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:15,274
SO HE'S OBVIOUSLY HAD SOME SORT
OF KNEE SURGERY.

820
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,361
SO THAT MIGHT BOTHER HIM
GETTING UP AND DOWN, MM-HMM.

821
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,321
>> Jeff: DAN, ARE YOU AWARE
THAT PEOPLE ARE WATCHING YOU?

822
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,490
THEY'RE CHECKING YOU OUT?

823
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,284
>> YES, BUT I'M THERE,
YOU KNOW?

824
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,327
I'LL COME UP
TO WHATEVER I HAVE TO DO,

825
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,163
AND IF I DON'T MEET
WHAT THEY WANT ME TO DO,

826
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:29,664
THEN I'LL BE VOTED OUT.

827
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:34,210
BUT, UH, I'M THERE.

828
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,921
>> Jeff: SO JIMMY T.,
YOU GET BACK FROM THE CHALLENGE

829
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,507
KNOWING YOU'VE GOT TO VOTE
SOMEBODY OUT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

830
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,967
WHAT WENT DOWN?

831
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,177
>> I THINK, OVERALL,
THE TRIBE IS PLANNING

832
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,013
ON KEEPING ITS STRONGEST PLAYERS
AND REMAINING STRONG.

833
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:46,681
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TELLING ME
ALL THE TIME,

834
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,849
AND I'M ON BOARD WITH THAT.

835
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,685
BECAUSE THAT'S CERTAINLY
NOT GOING TO HURT ME, SO...

836
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,561
>> Jeff: SO YOU'RE NOT ONE
OF THE WEAKER PLAYERS?

837
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,729
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

838
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:54,772
>> Jeff:
WHO ARE THE WEAK PLAYERS?

839
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,274
>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT
TO CALL PEOPLE OUT.

840
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,567
BUT, UM, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

841
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,360
WE GOT THREE
OR FOUR WEAK PLAYERS HERE.

842
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,154
I'M JUST KEEPING IT REAL, MAN.

843
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,447
>> Jeff: HOLLY, YOU THINK
YOU'RE ONE OF THE WEAK PLAYERS?

844
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,700
>> NO, I DON'T THINK I AM.

845
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,576
>> Jeff: JANE,
ARE YOU ONE OF THE WEAK MEMBERS?

846
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,869
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

847
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,079
>> Jeff: MARTY?

848
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,330
>> NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

849
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,373
>> Jeff: HOW ABOUT YOU, YVE?

850
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,666
>> I DON'T BELIEVE SO.

851
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:14,875
>> Jeff: JILL?

852
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,127
>> NO, NOT AT ALL.

853
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:16,544
>> Jeff: TYRONE?

854
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,586
>> NEGATIVE.

855
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,755
>> Jeff: OKAY,
THAT LEAVES TWO PEOPLE.

856
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,340
DAN, ARE YOU ONE OF
THE WEAKER PLAYERS IN THIS GAME?

857
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,216
>> I DON'T THINK I AM.

858
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:24,051
>> Jeff: YOU DON'T THINK
YOU ARE, EITHER.

859
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,054
SO JIMMY JOHNSON, ARE YOU ONE OF
THE WEAKER PLAYERS IN THIS GAME?

860
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,808
>> YEAH, I'M THE OLDEST PLAYER,
AND ONE OF THE WEAKEST, TOO.

861
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:37,023
>> Jeff: SO THE ONLY GUY HERE
WHO ADMITS TO THINKING

862
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:39,734
HE'S ONE OF THE WEAK PLAYERS
IS JIMMY JOHNSON.

863
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:43,070
SO, TYRONE, YOU GOT
TO MAKE A VOTE TONIGHT.

864
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,740
IS THAT A FREE PASS,
VOTE HIM OUT?

865
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,450
>> UH, THERE'S DEFINITELY
OTHER DYNAMICS,

866
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:50,244
BUT YOU ASKED JIMMY JOHNSON
A DIRECT QUESTION,

867
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:55,750
AND HE GAVE HIS ANSWER BASED
ON A SELF-ASSESSMENT, YOU KNOW.

868
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:56,584
>> Jeff: MARTY,
HOW ABOUT FOR YOU?

869
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,545
WHAT'S THE GOAL
OF TONIGHT'S VOTE?

870
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,756
>> I THINK IN PART, I'M ANXIOUS

871
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,133
TO GET THE GAME
A LITTLE MORE ACCELERATED

872
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:05,092
AND A LITTLE MORE ENGAGED.

873
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,719
PEOPLE ARE GOING
TO HAVE TO START THINKING

874
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,387
ABOUT ALL THE FACETS
OF THIS GAME,

875
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,139
NOT JUST
WEAKEST-STRONGEST CHALLENGES.

876
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,474
THERE'S A LOT GOING ON HERE.

877
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:15,102
>> Jeff: MAN, IF I DIDN'T THINK
PEOPLE WERE THINKING ABOUT THAT,

878
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,771
THE LAST THING
I WOULD DO IS REMIND THEM.

879
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:20,274
>> WELL, I JUST THINK,
IT FEELS AS IF WE'RE DOING A LOT

880
00:39:20,357 --> 00:39:21,776
OF SORT OF WAITING AROUND,
YOU KNOW?

881
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,111
AND NOW, I FEEL
THAT THE PACE IS PICKING UP.

882
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,448
AND CERTAINLY, GOING TO TRIBAL
COUNCIL IS A BIG DRIVER OF THAT.

883
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,827
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT,
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

884
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,996
JANE, YOU'RE UP.

885
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,679
>> COACH, YOU SAID
YOU'D LISTEN TO EVERYBODY,

886
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,306
BUT YOU NEVER REALLY
LISTENED TO ME.

887
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:55,267
I TRIED TO GIVE MY INPUT,
AND IT FELL ON DEAF EARS, SO,

888
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,644
GO LONG.

889
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,630
>> Jeff:
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

890
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:36,016
>> Jeff: ONCE THE VOTES ARE
READ, THE DECISION IS FINAL.

891
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,017
THE PERSON VOTED OUT
WILL BE ASKED

892
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,353
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.

893
00:40:39,436 --> 00:40:41,397
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

894
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:47,236
FIRST VOTE, JIMMY JOHNSON.

895
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:51,907
DANIEL. ONE VOTE JIMMY,
ONE VOTE DANIEL.

896
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,746
JIMMY. THAT'S TWO VOTES JIMMY,
ONE VOTE DANIEL.

897
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,795
JIMMY. THAT'S THREE VOTES JIMMY,
ONE VOTE DANIEL.

898
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,716
JIMMY JOHNSON.

899
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:12,803
THAT'S FOUR VOTES JIMMY,
ONE VOTE DANIEL.

900
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:16,056
THIRD PERSON VOTED OUT
OF<i> SURVIVOR: NICARAGUA--</i>

901
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,225
JIMMY JOHNSON.

902
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:18,934
THAT'S FIVE.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

903
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,937
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

904
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,737
JIMMY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

905
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,241
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

906
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,036
>> ONE OF YOU,
WIN A MILLION BUCKS, OKAY?

907
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:48,088
>> Jeff: WELL,
IN VOTING OUT JIMMY JOHNSON,

908
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,757
YOU VOTE OUT A PROVEN LEADER.

909
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,928
THE QUESTION IS, WHO'S GOING
TO STEP UP AND FILL THOSE SHOES?

910
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,763
GRAB YOUR TORCHES,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

911
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,765
GOOD NIGHT.

912
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,989
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

913
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,161
>> Jeff:
NEXT TIME ON<i> SURVIVOR...</i>

914
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,037
BATTEN DOWN THE HATCHES.

915
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,874
A FIERCE STORM IS ABOUT
TO WREAK HAVOC.

916
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,459
>> PUT THE BOXING GLOVES ON.

917
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:26,669
NOW I'M GOING
TO LET YOU HAVE IT.

918
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,629
>> Jeff: GET READY
FOR HURRICANE NAONKA.

919
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,422
>> YOU KNOCKED ME OVER?
>> YEAH.

920
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,131
>> I MEAN...

921
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:34,134
>> I'M JUST LETTING YOU KNOW.

922
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,011
SCREW YOUR LEG.
KEEP IT AWAY FROM THE FIRE.

923
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,434
>> I HAD FUN.

924
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:43,936
BUT I WAS MISERABLE
THE WHOLE TIME.

925
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,646
AND I STILL LOVE THE GAME,

926
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,189
AND IT'S BEEN A GREAT ADVENTURE.

927
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,649
THIS IS THE MOST STRESSFUL TIME

928
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,150
I'VE EVER GONE THROUGH
IN MY LIFE,

929
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,860
AND I'M INCLUDING SUPER BOWLS

930
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,946
AND COLLEGIATE
NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS.

931
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,532
I INITIALLY SAID,
"KEEP YOUR STRONGEST MEMBERS."

932
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:57,616
I OBVIOUSLY WASN'T ONE
OF THE STRONGEST MEMBERS.

933
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,492
I THINK THEY WILL COME TOGETHER
AND BE SUCCESSFUL.
