>> JEFF PROBST: I'm on the steps

2
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,049
of a 16th century Buddhist

3
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,801
monastery in one of the oldest

4
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:13,012
countries in the world, China.

5
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,807
16 Americans are beginning the

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,809
adventure of a lifetime in

7
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:25,400
ultramodern Shanghai.

8
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:27,235
But as their journey continues,

9
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:28,737
these 16 strangers are being

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,363
transported back in time.

11
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,951
Over the next 39 days, the

12
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:35,493
survivors will experience a

13
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,287
culture that dates back nearly

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,331
5,000 years.

15
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,337
These survivors come from a

16
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,256
wide variety of backgrounds.

17
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:51,509
A former Miss Montana.

18
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,219
A middle school lunch lady.

19
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,558
A Christian radio talk show

20
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,518
host.

21
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,854
A gay Mormon flight attendant.

22
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,274
A professional wrestler.

23
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,151
A University of South Carolina

24
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,779
honor student.

25
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:13,156
A chicken farmer from Virginia.

26
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,407
A professional poker player.

27
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,123
There's a fourth grade school

28
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,585
teacher, a Nashville musician.

29
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,464
A gravedigger from Louisiana.

30
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,799
A jewelry designer from Los

31
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,676
Angeles.

32
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,762
A New York City waitress.

33
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,597
A surfing instructor.

34
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,143
A bartender and former model.

35
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,228
And a 20-year-old student and

36
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,814
athlete, the youngest survivor

37
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,190
ever.

38
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,567
Their adventure will play out

39
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,152
in a remote section of China

40
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,779
where they will live in the

41
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:53,363
shadows of this temple on the

42
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,824
Lake of a Thousand Islands, a

43
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,283
harsh and remote land that will

44
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,201
challenge even the strongest of

45
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,787
survivors.

46
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,963
It is the ultimate challenge,

47
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,798
16 people, all from different

48
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,591
walks of life, forced to work

49
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:14,634
together to create a new

50
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:15,343
society while battling the

51
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:18,930
elements and each other.

52
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:19,514
They must learn to adapt or

53
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,724
they'll be voted out.

54
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:22,350
In the end, only one will

55
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,644
remain to claim the million

56
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,229
dollar prize.

57
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,314
39 days, 16 people, one

58
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,650

My grandfather passed away,

like, a couple of weeks ago.

74
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,348

I hope you have enjoyed your

journey so far.

81
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:38,486
Before the game can begin,

82
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,071
you are going to participate

83
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,364
in a Buddhist ceremony inside

84
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,533
this 400-year-old temple.

85
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,493
I want to assure everybody,

86
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,161
because I realize everybody has

87
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,122
different beliefs, this is not

88
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,290
a worship ceremony.

89
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,917
The people of this land want

90
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,794
you to feel welcome.

91
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,337
That's the whole point.

92
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,463
So, when you're finished,

93
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,633

98
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,578
in a temple like that, what a

00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,914
great experience.

100
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:32,498
It almost made me cry, to tell

you the truth.

102
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,960
It was just spiritual.

103
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,504

What do you think?

107
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,642
Do you think I know how to do

108
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,852
any of this stuff?

I want to sit back with the

lemonade.

114
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,526
Like, I don't really want to be,

115
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,402
like, bowing 37 times.

116
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,570
And we bowed... we bowed for,

117
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,404
like, days.

118
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,405
I swear to God, we were there

119
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,532
forever.

120
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,879
>> I'm a believer in Jesus

121
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:20,588
Christ, and in the Bible it

122
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,632
says, "Thou shall not bow down

123
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,801
to any other god."

124
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,010
You know, it really felt like

125
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,095
worship.

126
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:27,970
I mean, we're in a temple.

127
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,180
There's the Buddha.

128
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:31,641
I just couldn't do it.

129
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,643
It was emotional for me.

130
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,602
Because I knew I did the right

131
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,813
thing.

132
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:37,730
But it was so hard.

133
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,915
>> PROBST: Okay, so, Leslie, you

134
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:56,457
didn't make it through the

135

whole ceremony.

136
00:06:58,918 --> 00:06:59,877
What happened?

137
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,170
>> You know, I'm not a

138
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,421
religious person, but I have a

139
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,506
relationship with Jesus Christ,

140
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,590
and the only time I'm going to

141
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,591
put my face on the floor is for

142
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,509
him.

143
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,510

144
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,845
said this was a welcome...

145
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,054
>> I really didn't want to be

146
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:10,638
disrespectful.

147
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,932
But it felt like worship.

148
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,058
>> PROBST: Worried that it might

149
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,643
impact the next 39 days?

150
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,561
>> You know, I'm really not.

151
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:17,478
I'm just going to play the game

152
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,938

153
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,314
If they like me, great.

154
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,482
If they don't, you know, I'll

155
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,652
deal with that.

156
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,486
>> PROBST: A big theme in

157
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,157

of your worldly possessions.

159
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,954
That applies to suitcases.

00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,497
It means you will be going into

162
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,500

167

168
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,466
make you either very popular...

We have Frosti, Dave, Jaime,

194
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:33,596
Erik, Peih-gee, Sherea, Ashley,

195
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,014
and Chicken.

196
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:37,892
>> From the get go, I saw we

197
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,560
had a pretty strong team.

198
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,020
I'm the youngest and the

199
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:41,646
smallest guy out here, so I got

200
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,731
to prove my worth.

201
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:44,774
>> PROBST: Red tribe, your name

202
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,025
is Fei Long.

203
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,152
It means "flying dragon."

204
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,570
We have Jean-Robert, Leslie,

205
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:54,617
Amanda, Courtney, Denise,

206
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:00,831
James, Todd, and Aaron.

207
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:01,624
>> I am so happy to be a Fei

208
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,585
Long member.

209
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,587
Because I think James and Aaron

210
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,713
are definitely two of our

211
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,798
strongest members.

212
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:09,757
So, I think we're going to be a

213
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,551
powerhouse in challenges.

214
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,135
>> PROBST: All right, you are

215
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,137
about to engage in a battle.

216
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,764
For the next 39 days, you will

217
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,474
be involved in a struggle for

218
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:19,642
survival.

219
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,477
The single greatest document on

220
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,437
the history of strategy was

221
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,939
written by the Chinese,

222
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:25,606
<i>The Art of War.</i>

223
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,774
Look through this.

224
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,860
There is wisdom about strategy

225
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,570
in battle that could help you

226
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,738
win this game and the million

227
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:32,989
dollars.

228
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,074
<i>(laughter)</i>

229
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:35,700
I also have a map for each

230
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,411
tribe to your new home.

231
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,371
Fei Long, come get your<i> Art of</i>

232
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,497
<i>War</i> and your map.

233
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,249
Head out and go to the right.

234
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,083
The boat will be waiting for

235
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,459
you.

236
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,586
Zhan Hu, come get your<i> Art of</i>

237
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,753
<i>War</i> and your map.

238
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:48,754
Head out and go to the left of

239
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,089
the temple.

240
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:50,756
The boat will be waiting for

241
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,799
you.

242
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:52,258
Good luck, guys.

243
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,972
<i>(applause)</i>

244
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,775
>> The person farthest back has

245
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,110
the count.

246
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,403
>> I have a question, does

247
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,655
anybody know how to do this?

248
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,906
>> Let's just all calm down and,

249
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,866
like, nice and easy.

250
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,035
So we're all going straight

251
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,495
rather than spinning in circles.

252
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,913
So, we were on this lake in the

253
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,415
middle of China.

254
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,666
We have no idea where we are.

255
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,167
You know, it's like rice

256
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,835
paddies and tropical rain

257
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:28,836
forest.

258
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,672
And I don't think my tribe for

259
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,007
the most part knows what's

260
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,258
going on.

261
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,509
Right side, everybody.

262
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,927
Everybody, right side.

263
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:37,762
No left side.

264
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,264
I see myself as a leader, but I

265
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:40,806
try and do it as subtly as

266
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,766
possible.

267
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:42,850
I don't want the target on my

268
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,144
back.

269
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:48,189
<i>(cheers)</i>

270
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,232
>> Fei Long!

271
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,737
>> We've got a great team.

272
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,863
>> We do have a good team.

273
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:56,739
>> We've got, like, an axe

274
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,283
thing.

275
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,868
We've got rice, you guys!

276
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:01,869
>> Is that all that's in there,

277
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,746
is rice?

278
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:04,372
>> Yeah, just great big bag of

279
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,081
rice.

280
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:05,623
>> We're going to keep that

281
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:06,582
dry, you guys.

282
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,878
>> Oh, no.

283
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,588
It's raining.

284
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,844
>> What do you do, Todd?

285
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,179
>> I'm a flight attendant.

286
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,263
>> You're a flight attendant?

287
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,139
No way.

288
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,517
You are so cute.

289
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,476
>> I'm sorry, I am easily

290
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:25,893
irritated.

291
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,312
I seem like to be, like, sort

292
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,772
of marooned in a land of flight

293
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:30,856
attendants and Sunday school

294
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,107
teachers.

295
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,899
Like, come on.

296
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:32,900
I live in a city.

297
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,777
People who live in New York

298
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,988
don't act like this.

299
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,573
>> All right, let's do this.

300
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,700
Yeah, Fei Long!

301
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,618
>> This is like my own private

302
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:43,536
hell.

303
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:44,745
They're, like, exactly the kind

304
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,372
of people that I don't like

305
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,957
being around, who are all, like,

306
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,959
"Everything's always great.

307
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,336
Isn't it amazing?

308
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,379
Like you're doing a really good

309
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,339
job with that."

310
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,340
>> High five.

311
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,425
>> High five!

312
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:09,895
>> Yeah, dog.

313
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:10,938
Come on, now.

314
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:11,981
>> It's going to be our tree

315
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,107
mail, dude.

316
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,316
>> Oh, man.

317
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,734
>> There's nothing here.

318
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:16,360
>> You said you were a flight

319
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,027
attendant?

320
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:17,945
>> Yeah.

321
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:18,821
>> You really a flight

322
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:19,071
attendant?

323
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,781
>> Yeah, I really am.

324
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:21,991
>> For some reason, I don't... I

325
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,242
don't know.

326
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,160
>> You don't believe me?

327
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:24,994
>> It's like I kind of believe

328
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,370
you but...

329
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,121
>> Why would I lie about a job

330
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:27,997
like that?

331
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,915
>> I don't know, I don't know.

332
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,000
I don't know.

333
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,255
I like you.

334
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,923
I like you, but for some

335
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,175
reason, I... you seem a little

336
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:39,800
devious.

337
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,969
I'm a professional poker player.

338
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:42,970
And one of the strengths that I

339
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:46,223
have is my ability to read

340
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,558
players.

341
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,934
I'm just letting you know that

342
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,769
I know that you're sharp.

343
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:51,187
I don't know why.

344
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:51,979
My gut feeling tells me you're

345
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,856
particularly sharp.

346
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:54,982
My conversation with Todd was

347
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,484
deliberate.

348
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,943
I wanted him to know that,

349
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,278
"Listen, I know that you're the

350
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,613
clever guy.

351
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,947
Hey, I'm on to you.

352
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,157
Don't come this way, and we'll

353
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:03,908
be all right."

354
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,993
>> Right now, honestly, and I

355
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,954
mean this, is I really want to

356
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:09,830
be here.

357
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,999
Like, I just really, really,

358
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,710
really want to be here, and I

359
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:17,213
will do whatever to stay, you

360
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,506
know.

361
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,882
>> Jean-Robert was very right.

362
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,634
I will do whatever I need to do

363
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,886
to win that million dollars.

364
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:24,845
Can I ask you, though, to not

365
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,055
tell other people you think I'm

366
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,139
sharp?

367
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,104
>> I mean, I'm not saying that I

368
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,023
am, but I don't want to become

369
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,107
that one.

370
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,234
I can't have someone walking

371
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,443
around saying, "Watch out for

372
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,486
Todd."

373
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,612
I'm saying, "Watch out for

374
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:42,655
Jean-Robert" now.

375
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:43,531
I'm here to win a million

376
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:43,906
dollars.

377
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,074
It's a million dollars.

378
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,993
That's a lot of money.

379
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,217
>> We made it.

380
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,052
We got a pot.

381
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,053
I'm so hoping we'd have a pot.

382
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,888
What are we going to do about

383
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:08,764
shelter, something for the

384
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:09,848
night?

385
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:10,558
>> All right, let's start

386
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,642
thinking.

387
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,352
>> When I first walked up, I

388
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,896
have on a dress with heels.

389
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,064
I'm a southern girl, but I'm

390
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,567
not an outdoorsy girl, and this

391
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,110
situation is so disgusting and

392
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,779
so nasty.

393
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:25,447
Camp sucks.

394
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,575
This is way harder than I

395
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,785
expected.

396
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:30,786
>> Definitely build some kind

397
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:31,203
of lean-to with it.

398
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,079
>> Right.

399
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,122
>> I mean, if we can salvage any

400
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:33,998
of this...

401
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:34,915
>> Yeah.

402
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,667
>> It would be helpful.

403
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,668
>> Ready?

404
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,711
All right, good, good.

405
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,004
Watch that big piece of wood.

406
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,089
It's rotting.

407
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,592
It's... that's okay.

408
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:45,676
>> Let's think about this a

409
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,594
minute.

410
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,970
When you get that up, it

411
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,054
ain't going to be big enough for

412
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,264
all of us to sleep under, even

413
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,599
you can use that.

414
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,516
>> Okay, so what do you

415
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,559
suggest?

416
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,102
>> I suggest we build one.

417
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,353
>> Okay.

418
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,938
Well, let's build it.

419
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,148
>> This is essentially what we,

420
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,566
you know--

421
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,650
>> We could use the foundation

422
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,151
of the wood to build it.

423
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,778
>> Plus we have more back there.

424
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:05,321
>> I've got an opinion just

425
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:05,988
like everyone else.

426
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,948
Go ahead.

427
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,909
I'm from Virginia.

428
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,161
I lived in the woods.

429
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,912
I've got a lot of experience

430
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,539
over these characters.

431
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,165
Do you think this here is going

432
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,958
to hold up?

433
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,085
Seriously, come on.

434
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,003
>> We have to build something.

435
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:21,629
>> We have to build something,

436
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,088
though.

437
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:23,672
So let's stop being negative

438
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:24,173
and let's just start being

439
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,132
proactive.

440
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,217
>> I was just giving my

441
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,052
opinion, and nobody wanted it,

442
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,846
so I'm done suggesting, you

443
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:31,805
know.

444
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:32,973
I won't do that no more.

445
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,141
<i>(loud noise)</i>

446
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,018
>> Oh, God!

447
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,061
>> I'm sorry.

448
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,145
I've got a little gas.

449
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,063
I can't help it.

450
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:39,980
>> I don't mind, really.

451
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,774
I'm around wrestlers every day

452
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:42,149
of my life.

453
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,192
>> I seriously can't believe

454
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,028
you're a wrestler.

455
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,112
>> It's so fun.

456
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:47,696
It's the greatest job in the

457
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,365
world.

458
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,033
It's the funnest job ever.

459
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,118
I'm a WW Diva, and I wrestle

460
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:53,994
for a living.

461
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,454
I compete.

462
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,581
I think that it's probably

463
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,875
prepared me a great deal more

464
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,251
for this game.

465
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:01,835
I need to chop something up,

466
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,003
y'all.

467
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,171
Because there is that

468
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,631
competitive nature you have

469
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:06,215
within the locker room, and

470
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,842
that's a great positive that I'm

471
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:09,426
going to have going into this

472
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,219
game.

473
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,178
We are going to have a really

474
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,555
awesome shelter.

475
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,556
I don't want to go home a

476
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,140
loser, you know what I mean?

477
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,059
Because I know my fans are

478
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,185
going to want me to win.

479
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,145
Oh, hell, no, I can't dance at

480
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,271
all.

481
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,982
I'm the worst.

482
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,150
My girlfriends in the locker

483
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:25,734
room, like, they always play

484
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:29,363
music while we're getting ready.

485
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,489
I'm not doing it!

486
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:30,823
I can't.

487
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,164
>> I think I'm on the lazy

488
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,416
tribe.

489
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,792
Just seeing, like, half the

490
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:42,793
people wanting to just stand

491
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:43,877
around and talk about the most

492
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:44,837
ridiculous stuff I'd ever heard.

493
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,129
>> Oh, yeah.

494
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,214
>> What song?

495
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,257
>> It don't matter.

496
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,591
>> I can't connect to the

497
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,217
wackiness out here.

498
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,177
Like, I mean, I could probably

499
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,429
do it at home, but I just... I

500
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,180
feel like so serious.

501
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,065
>> Why can't we do the shelter

502
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,233
right here?

503
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,109
Because it's much more open and

504
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,068
cleaner than up there under the

505
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,278
trees.

506
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:09,695
>> Let's do it.

507
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:23,876
>> Honestly, we just need to

508
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,294
make a decision.

509
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:28,255
>> Why am I here?!

510
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,048
>> Oh, God, please help us.

511
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,551
<i>(laughter)</i>

512
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,811
>> I need some vines.

513
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,231
>> Is that helping, you guys?

514
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,274
>> Yeah.

515
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,484
>> Let's get more, though.

516
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,277
>> Yeah, oh, yeah.

517
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,197
>> Timber.

518
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,114
>> I just need a few more for

519
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,241
the bed.

520
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,454
>> You guys are, like, regular

521
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,997
lumbermen.

522
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,290
>> Timber!

523
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,458
>> We're getting a lot

524
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,542
accomplished with our shelter.

525
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,293
We are a very strong tribe.

526
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:09,254
We get along great, and we work

527
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,589
well together.

528
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,724
>> How you doing, James?

529
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,726
>> Hey, man.

530
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,187
>> I think James is amazing.

531
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,271
He's, like, Superman.

532
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,314
I've never seen... he just

533
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,942
works.

534
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,318
But I'm worried about James

535
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,486
because he's just been very

536
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:32,694
quiet.

537
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,320
I mean, you're an interesting

538
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,571
guy.

539
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,239
What do you do?

540
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,533
>> You bury people.

541
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,283
That's interesting.

542
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,409
Are you serious?

543
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,370
>> Yeah.

544
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,996
Yeah, I'm a grave digger.

545
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,164
I like that work because, you

546
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,415
know, I'm kind of by myself.

547
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,333
That's part of my problem over

548
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,376
here now.

549
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,002
I'm used to being by myself.

550
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:51,880
>> You know what, charm is

551
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,340
deceptive.

552
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,300
You be you and you'll be fine.

553
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,385
The whole initiation of the

554
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,594
social thing, talking and

555
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,388
trying to strategize, that's

556
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,223
going to kill me.

557
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,642
>> Okay, ask people questions,

558
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:04,768
because they love to talk about

559
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:05,978
themselves.

560
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:06,603
>> I'm definitely worried about

561
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,229
the social aspect.

562
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,397
I need to pay more attention to

563
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,566
that, so I need to do a little

564
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,442
bit more hustling.

565
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,569
Hopefully, pull out the

566
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,361
challenges and make them love

567
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,488
me.

568
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,468
>> The heavens unzipped on us.

569
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,281
>> Where we put the shelter is

570
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,282
very important, and this was,

571
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,241
obviously, a temporary thing.

572
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,619
>> Yeah, this, obviously...

573
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,287
>> It was a terrible idea.

574
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,040
>> What do y'all want to do?

575
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,458
>> Build a shelter.

576
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,292
>> Yeah, what do you want?

577
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,879
Here, here, up there?

578
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,422
Last night was really wet.

579
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,633
It's a reality check for these

580
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,218
guys up here.

581
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,261
We'll try to straighten this

582
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,013
mess up a little bit.

583
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:23,555
Maybe everybody will come

584
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:27,476
together today, you know.

585
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,144
>> There you go.

586
00:20:29,227 --> 00:20:30,771
>> Yeah!

587
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,441
>> Does someone want to find

588
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,276
stuff with me?

589
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,653
>> What are you going to do?

590
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,487
>> I'm going to find, like,

591
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,656
some leaves.

592
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,907
>> I think we need fronds and

593
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,911
vines.

594
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,788
>> I'm not feeling so good.

595
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,466
My first night was pretty rough.

596
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,426
I was soaking wet for the whole

597
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,594
night.

598
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,973
I think I'm pretty sick.

599
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:09,434
I have chills, like, really bad.

600
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,936
And, like, I keep dry heaving.

601
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:11,520
Like I want to throw up but

602
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,939
there's just nothing in there.

603
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:16,566
>> What about Ashley?

604
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,193
She does not look good at all.

605
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:19,736
>> I feel so worried for her.

606
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,781
>> I've wrestled sick before.

607
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,783
I've wrestled with 104 fever

608
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:25,534
before.

609
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,328
I have to stay in the game.

610
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,122
I'm not leaving.

611
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,457
Hopefully, it will pass.

612
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,959
>> I know, if you're feeling

613
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,377
bad don't start thinking you're

614
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,213
on the block just because of

615
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:39,172
this.

616
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:39,506
Okay?

617
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:40,507
Ashley, I thought she'd be a

618
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,176
lot stronger person,

619
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,553
considering her profession and

620
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:48,307
how her demeanor is.

621
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,766
But if Ashley's health stays

622
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,686
the same, Ashley's going first.

623
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,238
>> We've got some tree mail.

624
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:05,115
Waa!

625
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,616
Dude, check this out.

626
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:09,911
>> You guys, we got some tree

627
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:10,829
mail.

628
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:14,207
>> Fei Long!

629
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,375
>> You guys, check out how

630
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:18,795
cool, eh.

631
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,380
>> "The untested enemy you must

632
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,506
face today.

633
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,050
They may have the power to send

634
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,426
one of you away.

635
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,761
With your namesake held above

636
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:26,428
you, and with honor in your

637
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,596
heart, will you lead your tribe

638
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,057
to victory or be the first one

639
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,558
to depart?"

640
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,601
This is immunity, obviously.

641
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,477
>> Obviously.

642
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,603
Game is on, huh?

643
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,355
>> That book,<i> Art of War,</i> we

644
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:37,898
should take a look at that

645
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,150
probably before our challenge.

646
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,151
>> Yeah.

647
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:41,485
>> All right.

648
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,403
Chapter one, "The commander

649
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,404
stands for the general's

650
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,073
qualities of wisdom, sincerity,

651
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,449
benevolence, courage and

652
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,950
strictness."

653
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,243
>> In a way, it's saying we

654
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,204
need a commander, and I can't

655
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,580
help but notice that you've

656
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,540
kind of taken that position.

657
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,792
We do need someone who's

658
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,543
strong and knows how to take

659
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,628
lead, and you're very good at

660
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,629
it.

661
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,424
>> It feels weird, but, I think

662
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:04,716
I can do it.

663
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,551
>> Okay.

664
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,844
Aaron's a very strong player.

665
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,596
And I'm very, very smart in

666
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,474
trying to push the leader role

667
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,600
more so on to Aaron, because I

668
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:14,768
don't want to take that

669
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,311
position, but also to keep him

670
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:17,395
close to me.

671
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,522
I want him to trust me.

672
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,442
>> It will be like, a... it will

673
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,485
be like a democracy.

674
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,570
>> Yeah.

675
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,655
>> Being in the leadership

676
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,614
role, it's not someplace that I

677
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:28,824
want to be.

678
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:29,533
But leadership is just going

679
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,618
for it.

680
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,662
I'm ready, but I'm nervous.

681
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,002
>> "With your namesake held

682
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,420
above you, and with honor in

683
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,880
your heart, will you lead

684
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,048
your tribe to victory or be

685
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,925
the first one to depart?"

686
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:47,801
>> Ashley, you hanging in

687
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:48,593
there?

688
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:49,136
>> Yes, I'm going to pull

689
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,595
through.

690
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,179
>> If it's like obstacles, I

691
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,098
should be, probably... I'm

692
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,015
thinking I'm probably one of the

693
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:54,683
better guys.

694
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,225
I'm small, too, so it's easy

695
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,476
for me.

696
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,520
But climbing stuff isn't hard.

697
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,355
I'm a parkour and free-running

698
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:00,689
performer.

699
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,774
It is under control.

700
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,068
Parkour basically comes down to

701
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,611
what's the best, fastest, most

702
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:07,946
efficient, safest way to get

703
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:08,822
over anything.

704
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,240
So if there's a wall, you're

705
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,074
going to run up it, jump over

706
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:11,658
it.

707
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:12,534
If it there's rails, you're

708
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,827
going to bolt them.

709
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,828
Whatever it takes.

710
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,079
There we go, we've got it.

711
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,122
I'm going to use my skills to

712
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:17,831
do whatever I can to get my

713
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,374
team across the finish line

714
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,168
first and win.

715
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,760
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

716
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:44,900
So, tell me about the first

717
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,943
three days.

718
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,069
Chicken, how has life been at

719
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:48,737
Zhan Hu?

720
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,115
>> About as well as expected.

721
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,575
<i>(laughs)</i>

722
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,119
Overall, we're doing okay.

723
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,537
We're okay.

724
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,663
>> PROBST: Jean-Robert, what's

725
00:24:58,747 --> 00:24:59,789
the worst part?

726
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:00,582
>> The worst part, honestly,

727
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,001
Jeff, is just being fully

728
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,586
drenched and trying to sleep.

729
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,380
I haven't gotten a wink yet.

730
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,548
>> PROBST: All right, you guys

731
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,549
ready to get to your first

732
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:09,799
challenge?

733
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,384
>> Yeah.

734
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:11,718
>> Yeah!

735
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,762
>> PROBST: For today's

736
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,013
challenge, each tribe will be

737
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,431
tethered to and carrying a

738
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,433
ceremonial mascot that is both

739
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:19,559
awkward and heavy.

740
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,937
On my go, you must maneuver

741
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,022
through a series of obstacles.

742
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,357
When you get to the locked

743
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,942
gate, one tribe member will

744
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,568
race ahead and scale two walls,

745
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,154
releasing a drawbridge at each

746
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,698
wall.

747
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,033
You'll then retrieve a key,

748
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,118
race back, unlock the gate,

749
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,912
bring the rest of the tribe.

750
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,205
You must then make your way

751
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:40,789
through a swamp to the finish

752
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,582
platform, where you will need

753
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,709
to solve the puzzle.

754
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,586
Each tribe member must place

755
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,755
their pole in the correct spot.

756
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,590
The first tribe to do so wins

757
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,009
the challenge.

758
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,386
You want to know what you're

759
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,053
playing for?

760
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,012
>> Yes, please!

761
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,138
>> PROBST: The single most

762
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:57,764
important thing in this game is

763
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,392
immunity.

764
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,685
This is the immunity idol.

765
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,979
<i>(cheers and applause)</i>

766
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,438
When you have this in your

767
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,940
possession, you cannot be voted

768
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,650
out of this game.

769
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,860
Winning tribe gets immunity,

770
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,696
and winning tribe gets fire.

771
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,240
<i>(applause)</i>

772
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,658
Fire in the form of flint.

773
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:17,742
This will dramatically change

774
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,411
camp life.

775
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:19,828
Worth playing for?

776
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,621
>> Yes.

777
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,664
>> PROBST: One more thing, you

778
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,748
were given your running shoes

779
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:24,833
for this challenge.

780
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:25,667
You can take them back to camp

781
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,168
with you.

782
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,421
<i>(applause)</i>

783
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,255
Take your spots.

784
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,464
We'll get started.

785
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,053
Here we go.

786
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:37,679
It is the first challenge of

787
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,682
<i>Survivor: China.</i>

788
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,808
At the head of the dragon and

789
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,393
retrieving the key for Fei Long

790
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:43,810
is James.

791
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,812
At the head of the tiger for

792
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,897
Zhan Hu, Frosti.

793
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,482
For immunity and fire,

794
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,277
survivors ready?

795
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,570
Go!

796
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,829
Denise falls for Fei Long.

797
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:08,084
Zhan Hu trying to figure it out.

798
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:11,838
We're dead even early on.

799
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,466
The tribe that works together

800
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:15,425
the best will win this

801
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,968
challenge.

802
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:20,013
Still dead even going up the

803
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,515
first platforms.

804
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:25,810
Fei Long in the lead with the

805
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,687
red dragon.

806
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,065
>> Up top.

807
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:30,732
>> PROBST: Zhan Hu slow going

808
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:34,069
with the yellow tiger.

809
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:34,861
Fei Long with a bit of a lead.

810
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:41,910
James got to unclip.

811
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:42,869
James having trouble getting

812
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:45,622
unclipped.

813
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,957
Zhan Hu is catching up.

814
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,251
>> Go, go!

815
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,378
>> PROBST: Frosti is now

816
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,337
unclipped.

817
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,797
So is James.

818
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:02,847
Both guys leap the first wall.

819
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,057
Frosti forgot to lower his

820
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:04,349
drawbridge.

821
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,393
He lost some time.

822
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,567
James now with a bit of a lead

823
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:15,735
for Fei Long.

824
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:16,945
Frosti right behind.

825
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:17,946
Got to unlock the gate and then

826
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:23,201
clip back in.

827
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,869
James has his lock open.

828
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,080
Frosti got it open.

829
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,206
Both are clipping in.

830
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,667
You've got to get clipped in.

831
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,922
We are neck and neck again.

832
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,518
Neck and neck going into the

833
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:48,977
swamp.

834
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,522
Got to stick together.

835
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,649
Zhan Hu struggling with the

836
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:55,984
yellow tiger.

837
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:02,991
Fei Long taking that red dragon

838
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,619
in the lead.

839
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,329
Fei Long first to the finish

840
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,832
platform.

841
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:11,875
Zhan Hu falling behind.

842
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:18,673
Zhan Hu now to the finish

843
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:19,048
platform.

844
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,052
>> Over here!

845
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,762
>> PROBST: You've got to put

846
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:25,763
your poles in the correct order.

847
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:26,848
They go in one way and only one

848
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,308
way.

849
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,979
Fei Long with some progress.

850
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:33,980
Zhan Hu getting nowhere with

851
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:39,986
the puzzle.

852
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,112
Fei Long thinks they have it.

853
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,950
Fei Long wins immunity and fire!

854
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,998
>> Woo-hoo!

855
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,709
>> Yeah!

856
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:55,919
Way to go, baby.

857
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,304
>> PROBST: Fei Long, immunity.

858
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,388
>> Yeah!

859
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,224
<i>(applause)</i>

860
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,683
>> PROBST: Nobody going home

861
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:11,059
tonight.

862
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,645
Denise wants the flint.

863
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,063
There's your fire.

864
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,398
Zhan Hu, you've got a date with

865
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,651
me, tribal council tonight,

866
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,653
where one of the eight of you

867
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:22,237
will earn the distinction of

868
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,239
being the first person voted

869
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,907
out of<i> Survivor: China.</i>

870
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,908
You have the afternoon to

871
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:27,867
figure it out.

872
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:30,078
See you at tribal.

873
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:46,886
>> I need to air out my shoes.

874
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,013
>> Full of mud.

875
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:49,931
>> I need to go have a seat down

876
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,057
there.

877
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,059
>> Have a seat, take a break.

878
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:53,935
You need five minutes?

879
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,103
Do what you got to do.

880
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,688
>> I need, like, more than that.

881
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:57,105
>> Take... hey, hey.

882
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,148
Let it all out.

883
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,441
Don't care if you cry.

884
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,026
Bawl your little head off, okay.

885
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,779
Don't sweat it.

886
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:05,363
As I see it right now, we are

887
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,950
all still a complete tribe.

888
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,785
I'd like to see us function as

889
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:12,161
such, pretty please.

890
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,371
We have unfortunate business to

891
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,872
do tonight.

892
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:15,123
It sucks.

893
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,250
It is a fact of life.

894
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,376
>> We need to all, like, really

895
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,002
pitch in at camp because I just

896
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,254
feel like, I know everybody is

897
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:21,921
doing stuff, and I just feel

898
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,382
like there's so much to do.

899
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:24,966
And it just sucks... like, it

900
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,135
sucks to know that, you know.

901
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,095
>> We are not going to win any

902
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,013
challenges if we don't have,

903
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,557
like, a decent shelter.

904
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,057
>> It is hard out here.

905
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,934
More so than I ever imagined.

906
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,144
And I'm trying to get through it

907
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,980
without being down about it.

908
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,106
We have to do two crossbeams

909
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,149
under like this.

910
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,150
We need two more of these

911
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:42,942
things.

912
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,027
What do you think is the best

913
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,153
way?

914
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:45,945
Do you think do it the same way

915
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,323
is the best way?

916
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,157
>> You need to get everybody's

917
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,074
opinion.

918
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,159
>> I'm asking your opinion.

919
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,077
>> I agree with you.

920
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,537
>> I wasn't stating my opinion.

921
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:55,538
I was asking yours.

922
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:56,623
>> I agree with you.

923
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,291
That'll work.

924
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:00,335
>> But I just, I say the two

925
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,377
options.

926
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,295
So which one do you think is

927
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,087
better in your opinion?

928
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,005
>> I would put two more pieces

929
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,299
down like you said.

930
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,216
>> I know you want to put two

931
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,594
more pieces, but how?

932
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:10,762
Chicken won't give an opinion

933
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:11,304
on how he thinks anything

934
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:12,138
should be done.

935
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,140
It's not worth anything to me

936
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:16,309
if he chooses not to apply his

937
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,560
strength.

938
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,394
We're going to try to keep the

939
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,312
instruments, if they're not in

940
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,063
use just in one area so

941
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,523
everybody knows where they are,

942
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,151
and, like, they don't get lost.

943
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,944
>> Peih-gee, all of a sudden,

944
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:27,487
she's sort of barking out

945
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,572
orders and trying to step into

946
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,366
this leadership position.

947
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,617
>> Take these two jugs and pour

948
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,201
them out into that big thing.

949
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,536
>> All righty.

950
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,537
>> If you're going to do that,

951
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,413
then you shouldn't be crying

952
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:38,539
after challenges.

953
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,374
You know, that's not a leader

954
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,001
role.

955
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,670
I know we have to work and

956
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:44,253
everything, but we still have

957
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,004
to think what we're going to do

958
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:48,257
at tribal council.

959
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,634
>> I would hope to think I'm

960
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,010
not going to be voted out by

961
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,554
anybody because I'm not sick at

962
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,806
all.

963
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,391
I feel a million times better

964
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,975
than I did before.

965
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,102
I see what can do.

966
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,229
I would hate to think one day

967
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,981
of being sick would dominate

968
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,149
over everything.

969
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:10,571
>> She was sick yesterday.

970
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,239
So....

971
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,366
>> That's not the point.

972
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:14,409
>> That's true.

973
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,368
>> I didn't ask if she was sick.

974
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,786
I just asked you what she done

975
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:17,120
yesterday.

976
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:20,832
Whether<i> (inaudible),</i> whether you

977
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,208
fell down the bank and sprained

978
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,084
you ankle, or you got a damn

979
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,085
headache, or whatever, it's an

980
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,044
ailment that can take you out of

981
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:25,294
the game.

982
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:28,172
It's just that, you know... it's

983
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:31,008
just that simple.

984
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,218
I feel like Ashley's gone.

985
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,302
That's what I'm writing down

986
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,679
tonight.

987
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:35,805
She ain't done nothing since

988
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:36,305
she's landed down here.

989
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,098
What are you doing?

990
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,850
You don't know?

991
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,226
>> I need to figure stuff out.

992
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,895
>> Whatever happens, happens.

993
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:43,479
You know, I don't even know if

994
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,189
I'm 100% safe tonight, you

995
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,149
know, for whatever reason.

996
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,275
That's what makes the element

997
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,694
of the game.

998
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:05,626
>> I think the heads on the

999
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,295
block tonight are Chicken,

1000
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,255
Ashley, and Peih-gee.

1001
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,466
Chicken, I, you know, we're the

1002
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,050
two oldest guys.

1003
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,969
And I've got nothing against

1004
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:16,137
youth, but, you know in this

1005
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,764
kind of environment situation,

1006
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:18,389
I would prefer to have a little

1007
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,767
more experience in our tribe

1008
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,934
right now.

1009
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,273
I don't wish anybody bad here.

1010
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:29,776
But I want our tribe to be

1011
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:30,151
strong.

1012
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,695
And it's time to make stuff

1013
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,363
happen.

1014
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:08,147
>> PROBST: Behind each of you

1015
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,982
is a torch.

1016
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:10,525
Go ahead and grab a torch.

1017
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,151
Approach the flame.

1018
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,362
This is part of the ritual of

1019
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,906
tribal council because in this

1020
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:20,243
game fire represents your life.

1021
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,370
As long as you have fire, still

1022
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,789
in the game; when your fire's

1023
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:29,710
gone, so are you.

1024
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,378
Let's talk about the first few

1025
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,922
days.

1026
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:33,506
Peih-gee, was this more than

1027
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:36,134
you bargained for?

1028
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,176
>> You know, I came in here

1029
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,219
thinking this was a piece of

1030
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,347
cake, but it is mud everywhere.

1031
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,598
Trying to build a shelter is

1032
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,934
hard because you don't have the

1033
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,185
right implements.

1034
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,311
>> PROBST: Chicken, you held up

1035
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,354
two fingers.

1036
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:48,896
>> It took us two days to do

1037
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,356
that.

1038
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,607
We should have had it by dark

1039
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,025
the first day.

1040
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,152
>> PROBST: Did you try to become

1041
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,152
the leader and say, "Hey, let's

1042
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:55,403
go, guys."

1043
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,238
>> I'm not grabbing the bull by

1044
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,073
the horns and done that, no, I

1045
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:00,408
haven't.

1046
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,159
But I guess somebody's going to

1047
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,327
have to before we come together.

1048
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,246
That's what's going to have to

1049
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,247
be done.

1050
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,665
>> PROBST: Show of hands--

1051
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:08,833
anybody here willing to say

1052
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,167
right now, "I will step up and

1053
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,253
be the leader of this tribe?"

1054
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:15,214
Well, you've got two, one man,

1055
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,883
one woman.

1056
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:17,842
>> We don't have time to mess

1057
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:18,426
around.

1058
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,553
I did not want to step in to

1059
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,763
this position at all.

1060
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:23,806
And you know what?

1061
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,099
If I don't step up and kick

1062
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:25,600
someone in the butt to do

1063
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,267
something, I don't know what's

1064
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,269
going to happen, but I will

1065
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,313
step up and do what I can to

1066
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,231
help get this tribe together

1067
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,359
and proficient and then focus

1068
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,777
on the challenges at hand, and

1069
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,195
hopefully get it really nice

1070
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,572
and tight.

1071
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,615
>> PROBST: Peih-gee, you put

1072
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,490
your hand up.

1073
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,575
What would you bring as a

1074
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:43,784
leader?

1075
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,036
>> It is hard because you don't

1076
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,037
want to be bossy.

1077
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,079
These are grown people and I

1078
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:47,705
don't want to be sitting around

1079
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:48,456
trying to tell people what to

1080
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,249
do, but on the other hand,

1081
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,918
somebody has to kind of do it

1082
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,419
if it's not happening naturally.

1083
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:54,587
If you're just floundering

1084
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,630
around, you're going to die out

1085
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,298
here.

1086
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,299
>> PROBST: So, did you guys just

1087
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,467
make a decision, your first

1088
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,468
tribe decision?

1089
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,471
>> Yes!

1090
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,181
>> PROBST: But after tonight's

1091
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:05,806
tribal council, there will only

1092
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,683
be seven people left, so you're

1093
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:08,809
probably wise to always be a

1094
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,478
little concerned.

1095
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,313
Okay, so made a little progress

1096
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,440
as a tribe.

1097
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,233
Now you have to make your first

1098
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,401
big decision.

1099
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,319
Who do you get rid of?

1100
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,445
Dave, what does this tribe need

1101
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,948
to do with tonight's vote to

1102
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,366
make it a better tribe?

1103
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:26,410
>> Trying to trim the

1104
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,912
least-productive people out of

1105
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:30,289
it.

1106
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,540
>> PROBST: Chicken, what are you

1107
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,541
going to base your vote on

1108
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,668
tonight?

1109
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,294
>> I'll base my vote on tonight

1110
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,338
the person who has done the

1111
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,298
least in the last three days.

1112
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,259
It's just cut and dried.

1113
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:41,842
>> PROBST: Erik, how important

1114
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:42,510
is it whether somebody is

1115
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:43,511
pulling their weight or not

1116
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:44,512
pulling their weight?

1117
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,472
>> I think contributions is

1118
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,431
huge.

1119
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,766
I mean, especially now that

1120
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:49,934
we've realized how long it

1121
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:50,476
takes to build a shelter.

1122
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,352
And so I think we're going to

1123
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,312
really have to hold each other

1124
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,313
accountable.

1125
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,356
>> PROBST: Ashley, think you're

1126
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:58,275
fitting in with this group?

1127
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,694
>> I did for a while.

1128
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:00,319
And I mean, now that I'm

1129
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,487
hearing everybody speak freely,

1130
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,573
I kind of feel like that if you

1131
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:05,366
broke it down per day, I was

1132
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,535
throwing up, I was laying on

1133
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,786
the ground.

1134
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:09,954
I pretty much was feeling like

1135
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:10,496
I was going to die.

1136
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:12,373
And I guess if you put that in

1137
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,084
the equation, then I would

1138
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,002
have technically been the one

1139
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,086
who has done the least amount

1140
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,004
of work.

1141
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:18,879
I don't feel like I should be

1142
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,089
judged on that.

1143
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,132
>> PROBST: So you're feeling a

1144
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:21,882
little uneasy.

1145
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:22,925
>> Right now I am because I

1146
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,344
hear how they're talking.

1147
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,346
>> PROBST: Chicken, how do you

1148
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,681
think you're fitting?

1149
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,307
>> I don't fit in.

1150
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:30,725
You know, I don't.

1151
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,476
But, I'm not the one that's

1152
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,104
done the least amount of work,

1153
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:37,231
and you're out there in the

1154
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:37,648
middle of a jungle.

1155
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,400
You ain't got nothing.

1156
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,444
So do you want the guy that

1157
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,739
don't fit in or do you want the

1158
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:45,573
guy that works?

1159
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,408
You know, if we don't open our

1160
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,619
eyes, we going to be seeing you

1161
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,414
a lot.

1162
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,124
>> PROBST: Okay, so, it sounds

1163
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:55,708
like you have a plan to have

1164
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,960
leadership in your tribe.

1165
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,211
Now you have to make the first

1166
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,337
big decision-- who to get rid

1167
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,213
of.

1168
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,173
It is time to vote.

1169
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,591
Frosti, you're up.

1170
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,610
>> I'm voting for Peih-gee

1171
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:23,402
because I feel like the group

1172
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,612
already has a leader, and

1173
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,031
that's Dave.

1174
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,379
>> Just bad luck.

1175
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,924
Wrong time, wrong place.

1176
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,687
>> Chicken, I think you've

1177
00:39:58,771 --> 00:39:59,980
truly lived up to your

1178
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,232
nickname.

1179
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,066
You've been too afraid to step

1180
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,609
up to anything, and we don't

1181
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,277
need that right now.

1182
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,243
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1183
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:12,535
votes.

1184
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,503
>> PROBST: Once the votes are

1185
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,462
read, the decision is final.

1186
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:24,547
The person voted out will be

1187
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,841
asked to leave the council area

1188
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:27,883
immediately.

1189
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,427
I'll read the votes.

1190
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:34,807
First vote, Chicken.

1191
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:39,311
Ashley.

1192
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,480
Ashley.

1193
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:42,857
Two votes Ashley, one vote

1194
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,067
Chicken.

1195
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,653
Peih-gee.

1196
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:50,948
Chicken.

1197
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:51,574
There's two votes Chicken, two

1198
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:55,911
vote Ashley, one vote Peih-gee.

1199
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,913
Chicken.

1200
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,290
There's three votes Chicken,

1201
00:40:59,373 --> 00:40:59,832
two votes Ashley, one vote

1202
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:04,003
Peih-gee.

1203
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:04,545
First person voted out of

1204
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,672
<i>Survivor: China--</i> Chicken.

1205
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,091
>> Damn!

1206
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,342
>> PROBST: That's four.

1207
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,093
That's enough.

1208
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,803
You need to bring me your torch.

1209
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,520
Chicken, the tribe has spoken.

1210
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,480
>> I heard 'em.

1211
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,984
>> PROBST: Time for you to go.

1212
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,207
Well, if there's one good thing

1213
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,208
about coming to tribal council

1214
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,709
tonight, you will go back to

1215
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,336
camp with your torches, which

1216
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:46,962
means you will have fire.

1217
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:48,714
>> Oh, my gosh!

1218
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:49,590
>> PROBST: Here's flint.

1219
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,550
>> Yes!

1220
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:52,760
>> Oh, my God!

1221
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:53,594
>> PROBST: Grab your torches.

1222
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:54,637
Head back to camp.

1223
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,014
Good night.

1224
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:08,359
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1225
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,860
from our next episode.

1226
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:12,821
>> PROBST: Next time on

1227
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:13,822
<i>Survivor:</i>

1228
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,324
At Fei Long, the poker player's

1229
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:15,699
bluff is called.

1230
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,659
>> Jean-Robert, you need to

1231
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,702
start pulling your weight.

1232
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,538
>> Why don't we all rest?

1233
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,039
>> PROBST: Dave takes command

1234
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:22,623
at Zhan Hu.

1235
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:23,666
>> You're the leader and I'll

1236
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,542
let you do what you want.

1237
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:26,085
>> How many fires have you

1238
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,461
built, sweetheart?

1239
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:28,170
If she want to fight, I can

1240
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:28,754
give her a fight.

1241
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:29,380
>> PROBST: And the pro wrestler

1242
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,465
comes out in Ashley.

>> It was kind of a shock that

1250
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:39,807
the young group didn't come

1251
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,059
together, and I don't think

1252
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:42,935
they ever will.

1253
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:43,769
They're just playing by the

1254
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:44,186
seat of their pants.

1255
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,397
I put a lot of thought going

1256
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,022
into it but I never got nowhere.

1257
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,607
There's no one more proud to be

1258
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:51,485
such a small part of one

1259
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:52,945
big adventure.

1260
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,363
It was truly an honor to be

1261
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:55,281
here.

1262
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:55,781
Without a doubt.
