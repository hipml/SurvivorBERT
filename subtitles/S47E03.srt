<i>I don't want</i>

667
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,365
Andy knowing
that I lost my vote,

668
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:21,633
<i>but I need to make sure</i>

669
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:24,302
<i>that my alliance members</i>
<i>are aware of that</i>

670
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,869
if we go to Tribal.

671
00:28:25,936 --> 00:28:27,605
The thing is, there wasn't
a choice to play the game.

672
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:28,740
-I had to play the game.
-Okay.

673
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,275
And I had to reach in
and get a scroll.

674
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,577
And I unfortunately got one out
and it said, "Lose Your Vote."

675
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,279
-Okay. No worries.
-Okay.
-And...

676
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,648
-Okay, good.
-Fair.

677
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:40,218
Yeah.

678
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:41,352
SIERRA:
Don't let it stress you, though.

679
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:42,487
Don't let it get in your head.

680
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,555
You're good.

681
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:44,722
I think I'm actually okay.

682
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:45,723
-You're okay.
-Yeah.

683
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,025
<i>Even though I lost my vote,</i>

684
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,327
<i>Sierra, Rachel and I--</i>
<i>we're solid.</i>

685
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,430
They've given me the confidence
that I'll be okay.

686
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:55,800
I pick one,
and it was Lose Your Vote.

687
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,268
But in my head I'm like,
"There's no way

688
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:58,770
I'm going for the second one."

689
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,238
Like, I'm not losing my vote
for two Tribal Councils.

690
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:01,406
So I was like, "You know what?

691
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:02,807
I'll take the loss,
and that's it."

692
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:05,443
No, I don't. It was up there.

693
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,112
I just left it in the bag.
I left it at the table.

694
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:08,179
Yeah.

695
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,181

696
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:13,451

698
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,856
<i>They have no idea.</i>

699
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,291
And right now I feel
like I'm playing it perfectly.

700
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:24,129
-All right. So, anything new
to actually say, or...?
-(chuckles)

701
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:27,165
-You think I would go out there
and lose my vote? Come on.
-Oh, my God.

702
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,833
So what'd you get this time?

703
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,735
-Steal a Vote.
-Get out.

00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,771

<i>where you will</i>
<i>retrieve a key underwater.</i>

<i>You're then going</i>
<i>to cross a balance beam</i>

751
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,565
<i>and swim to the finish.</i>

752
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:43,067
<i>The rest of the tribe is going</i>
<i>to run the same course,</i>

<i>only in pairs,</i>

<i>retrieving two more keys</i>
<i>along the way.</i>

safe from the vote, nobody
going home from your tribe.

In addition,
you're playing for a reward.

what you're playing for?

It's not food,

762
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:07,325
but it'll help.

Yes!

764
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,564

-Hammock. Wow.

00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,099
Two hammocks, the tarp.

-I'll take that.
-Duly noted.

768
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:21,339
-Yes.
-Second tribe to finish--
no hammocks.

769
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:24,676
One small tarp will still
make a big difference.

770
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:26,344
-Yeah.
-PROBST:
The last tribe to finish,

771
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:27,945
otherwise known as the losers,

772
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:29,714
got nothing for you but a date
with me at Tribal Council...

773
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,083
-Hell no.
-...where someone will be
the third person

774
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,152
voted out of<i> Survivor</i> 47,
and as a penalty

775
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:36,287
for losing,
I will keep your flint.

776
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:39,157
Tuku, you are playing
to earn yours back.

777
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,359
Before I send you out
into this challenge,

778
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:44,362
let's just take a moment,
because when you're at home

779
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,564
and you see this, you think,
"Oh, that'd be so fun."

780
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,034
Now that you're here
in the middle of the ocean

781
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:53,271
with a very tall tower
and a very deep ocean,

782
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:56,274
anybody here willing to say,
"It's a little more intimidating

783
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:57,608
than I thought
it might have been"?

784
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,777
-Absolutely.
-Definitely.
-Really?

785
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:02,113
-Yeah.
-PROBST: Kishan, what is it

786
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,881
now that you're out here?

787
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:05,216
I never knew how to swim

788
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:06,684
until four months
before I came out here.

789
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,219
-Wow.
-And I took swimming lessons,

790
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:10,388
so, of course, there's that
voice in the back of my head

791
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:11,889
that's like, "Dude,
you just learned how to do this.

792
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:13,891
"Now you're doing this
in an ocean.

793
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,326
"You're doing this exhausted

794
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,428
in a deep, deep ocean."

795
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,531
It-It's-it's scary. It becomes
very real, real quick.

796
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:22,900
-The ocean is definitely not
a swimming pool.
-Exactly.

797
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,702
All right, Lavo,
you have one extra person.

798
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:25,803
Sitting somebody out.

799
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,505
Cannot be Aysha.
Who's it gonna be?

800
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:30,041
-Me.
-PROBST:
Genevieve gonna sit out.

801
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,476
Now, I'm curious. I got to ask.

802
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:33,811
Kishan, you admitted
swimming is not your strength,

803
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:36,814
but you're gonna participate
in this one. Why?

804
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:38,216
You got to believe in yourself.

805
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:40,251
It's a mentality thing.
And if you don't

806
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:41,786
believe in yourself
and you start doubting yourself

807
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,155
in these moments,
it's gonna carry forward.

808
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:47,125
That's why you apply
to be on<i> Survivor</i> right there.

809
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,329
All right, Genevieve, take
a spot on the sit-out bench.

810
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:52,764
Everybody else,
give you a minute to strategize.

811
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,466
-We'll get it on. Let's do it.
-Yes! Let's go!

812
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:12,817
-SUE: Yes, I agree.
-CAROLINE: I agree. Sounds good.

813
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,257
Like, I'm-I'm gonna...

814
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,561
All right, fine.

815
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,335
All right, here we go.

816
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,005
For immunity and reward.

817
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:35,440
Survivors ready?

818
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,978
-Go!
-GENEVIEVE: Go, Lavo!

819
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:45,082

Your next stop is that crate.

830

You got to climb up

00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:55,880
Gata down to three pieces now.

999
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:59,750
This is in the deep freeze.
Lavo's going to Tribal Council.

1000
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:02,585
I'm gonna call it.
Genevieve can only watch.

1001
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:07,491
Rachel trying to get
that piece in. She's got it.

1002
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:09,360
Gata down to their last piece.

1003
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:12,930
For immunity and reward.

1004
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:15,766
-Gata has it.
-(screaming)

1005
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:19,335
Gata wins immunity and reward--
large tarp

1006
00:42:19,402 --> 00:42:21,538
and two hammocks.

1007
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:24,541
It now just comes
to a nice finish for Tuku.

1008
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:26,310
SUE:
You got it, Gabe.

1009
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,812
There it is.
Tuku down to two now,

1010
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:32,049
as Tribal Council's inevitable
for Lavo.

1011
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:35,052
Tuku down to their last piece.

1012
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,321
(cheering)

1013
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,789
PROBST:
There it is.

1014
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:42,593
-Tuku wins immunity and reward.
-(cheering)

1015
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,295
Safe from Tribal Council,

1016
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:48,799
sending Lavo to Tribal Council
for the first time

1017
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:52,268
this season, where somebody
will be the third person

1018
00:42:52,335 --> 00:42:54,605
voted out of<i> Survivor</i> 47.

1019
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:56,707
Ah! Come on!

1020
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:02,112
Gata, congratulations.

1021
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:08,118
Nobody going home from Gata.
No Tribal Council tonight.

1022
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:10,955
In addition, nice reward
waiting for you back at camp.

1023
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:13,023
Hot day like this,
that tarp will help a lot.

1024
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,591
Two hammocks will make things

1025
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:15,592
a little more comfortable.

1026
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:16,593
-Well done.
-Thank you.

1027
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,663
Tuku, nice job.

1028
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,332
(overlapping chatter)

1029
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:22,833
Yeah.

1030
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,003
PROBST: Nobody going home from
Tuku, no Tribal Council tonight.

1031
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:28,038
Smaller tarp waiting for you
back at camp.

1032
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,573
-Well done.
-Appreciate it.

1033
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,575
-In addition...
-(whooping)

1034
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:32,609
...you also earned
your flint back.

1035
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:34,478
-Thank you.
-We'll take it.

1036
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:37,915
All right, swim out,
enjoy the night off.

1037
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:39,984
-Big jump?
-PROBST: Celebrate.

1038
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:44,054
-Go, guys.
-(laughing): Yay!

(Kyle howls)

1040
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:52,196
All right, Lavo.
New part of the game, Rome.

1041
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:54,331
You have not had
to vote somebody out.

1042
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:57,201
Some fans would say you haven't
actually played<i> Survivor</i>

1043
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:58,936
until you've gone
to Tribal Council.

1044
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:00,337
What are you feeling right now?

1045
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,606
I mean, me personally,
I'm feeling

1046
00:44:02,672 --> 00:44:05,376
a lot of nervousness. I mean,
I came back from the journey and

1047
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:06,810
told my tribe
exactly what happened.

1048
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:08,812
So they all know
that I don't have a vote.

1049
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:10,881
So, really, I have no say
in what happens tonight.

1050
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:13,050
So I'm just gonna be sitting
there like a bump on a log.

1051
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:15,452
So, who knows
how tonight's gonna go?

1052
00:44:15,518 --> 00:44:17,788
All right, Lavo,
Tribal Council tonight,

1053
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:21,792
where somebody will be the third
person voted out of<i> Survivor</i> 47.

1054
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:24,527
And as a penalty for losing,
I'm gonna take your flint.

1055
00:44:24,594 --> 00:44:26,830
Sorry for you, Genevieve.

1056
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:29,299
-(Genevieve sighs)
-You will have a chance
to earn it back

1057
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:30,467
at the next challenge.

1058
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:31,969
Swim out. See you tonight
at Tribal Council.

and try to hurt as little amount

to target Rome, but I cannot,

1097
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:29,585
because we have
this large suspicion

1098
00:46:29,652 --> 00:46:30,921
that he has something

1099
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:34,056

and he just stopped looking.

1103
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:44,101
If we focus today
on getting out Genevieve,

1104
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:45,835
'cause I just don't think
we can get Rome out.

-No, I don't. Neither do I.

-We can't take that risk.
-Exactly.

00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:04,188
<i>With Aysha,</i>
<i>I want her to feel like</i>

1114
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:07,090
I'm good with her and that I'm
going with our original plan,

1115
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,726
that I'm working with her

00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:11,495
<i>Though, in small ways,</i>

1117

<i>I'm trying to give her</i>

1118
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,299

1123
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:30,480

to be Aysha,

-but we want Sol to play

<i>ROME:</i>
<i>Okay. What's your reasoning?</i>

1128

<i>Teeny started</i>
<i>to break it down a little bit,</i>

1129
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:01,678
<i>and she made perfect sense,</i>
<i>because right now, for my game,</i>

1130
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:04,214
the biggest threat is someone
else finding that next idol,

1131
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,016
because I have
to play mine tonight.

1132
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,718
You made such a good point.

1133

-'Cause I have
to play my idol tonight.
-You have to.

1134
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,455
Which means that there's gonna
be an idol back out here.

1135
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:13,457
Yes, absolutely. And you know
it's gonna be a mad dash.

1136
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:14,958
The second I get back to camp,

1137
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:16,360
I'm hitting the jungle
in the middle of the night.

1138
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:17,594
-Exactly.
-Like, I'm that type of person.

00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:19,396
And you know who else would?

1140

-Sol.
-Sol.

1141
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:21,864
I have wanted to vote out Sol

1142
00:48:21,931 --> 00:48:23,533
since the start of this game.

1143
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,502
<i>I cannot stand the dude</i>
<i>at this point.</i>

1144
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:29,739
<i>So the fact that it ended up</i>
<i>turning from Aysha over to Sol,</i>

1145
00:48:29,806 --> 00:48:31,608
that just made me smile
ear to ear.

1146
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:34,645
I'd be willing to write
Sol's name down lickety-split.

1147
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:36,146
I cannot wait
to do that tonight.

1148
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:38,015
<i>So as long as we can get him</i>

1149
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,716
<i>to not play</i>
<i>his Shot in the Dark,</i>

1150
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:41,818

-So...

-...to have. Yeah. Like...

-All right, man.

1273
00:54:25,661 --> 00:54:27,931

-Thanks, Rome.

1283
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:49,386
What I was gonna ask was,
coming into tonight,

1284
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:53,189
what do you think this tribe
hopes to be with tonight's vote?

1285
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:55,558
GENEVIEVE:
I think everyone
today was a little emotional

1286
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:59,229
because tonight's
killing someone's dream,

1287
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:01,264
and so the hope is

1288
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:05,068
that the five
who go back are still cohesive.

1289
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,538
So, Sol, do you get the feeling

1290
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,040
that tonight's vote is based

1291
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:12,208
on trying
to make the tribe stronger,

1292
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:15,779
or this is about alliances and
I got to make sure I'm in one?

1293
00:55:15,844 --> 00:55:18,348
I thought
it was about alliances.

1294
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:21,951
I felt really good
with who I was paired with, but

1295
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:25,722
I got a very uneasy feeling
in my stomach, and so...

1296
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:29,025
So, as we sit here right now,
you're feeling that uncertainty?

1297
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:31,127
Yeah, it's, uh,
it's not a good feeling

1298
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:32,796
that I'm feeling right now.

1299
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:34,898
Can you overthink it, Rome?

1300
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:36,433
You can definitely overthink it.

1301
00:55:36,498 --> 00:55:38,334
Once you get paranoid
and, you know, you start

1302
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:40,503
talking with people, and
you might say the wrong thing,

1303
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,772
and that might make them think,
"Oh, man,

1304
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,774
this person's
not really trusting me."

1305
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,710
Even though
they weren't gonna be the vote,

1306
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:47,977
now they will be the vote
just because

1307
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:50,180
they're getting
a little bit too paranoid.

1308
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:52,681
PROBST:
Aysha, do you feel the same way?
That it can literally

1309
00:55:52,748 --> 00:55:54,984
change like that?
Everything was fine,

1310
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:57,152
then somebody says the wrong
thing and everything shifts?

1311
00:55:57,219 --> 00:56:00,223
Yeah, it can change
at the drop of a hat.

1312
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,659
Like, you could have
a conversation with a person,

1313
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:05,395
and an hour later
they're not being as reassuring.

1314
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:09,532
It's like, "Oh, okay,
maybe that may not be the plan.

1315
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,001
"Maybe that was just something
in the moment just to tell me.

1316
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:13,369
Maybe I should be worried."

is something as simple
as the Shot in the Dark

1320
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:22,212
or some other advantage
or idol in the game.

1321
00:56:22,277 --> 00:56:24,080
Did you sense

1322
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:26,683
that there's someone
feeling on the outs today?

1323
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:29,552
I did not sense that, and
that's probably a misperception

1324
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:33,223
on my end, because, for me,
I'm strong to the core four.

1325
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,626
And you know, I want to go ahead

1326
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:39,829
and move forward
with whatever we believe in.

1327
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,164
-So...
-PROBST: Who's the core four?

1328
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,299
-I'm not gonna say.
-But there is four?

1329
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:45,101
-Maybe.
-PROBST: Teeny?

1330
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:47,137
TEENY:
I mean,
when he says "core four,"

1331
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:48,338
you have no choice
but to believe him.

1332
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:50,406
It's interesting because people

1333
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:52,442
who aren't involved in the plan
have to know something.

1334
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:54,444
So you have to be talking
to everybody.

1335
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:57,147
And if that means that you feel
like you trust somebody enough

1336
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:59,149
to where you're locked in
with them,

1337
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:01,684
and you don't need to reassure
them as much, then there you go.

1338
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,953
Sol, that sounds like a message.

1339
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:06,055
If you're part of the core four,
the core four is saying,

1340
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:08,591
"Dude, come on,
we're good. Relax."

1341
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:10,326
SOL:
Yeah,
that's what it sounds like, um,

1342
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:13,229
but this is<i> Survivor,</i>
and I'm trying to find out,

1343
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:16,099
is this, like, part of the game
where I'm going crazy,

1344
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,801
or is it, they're just

1345
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,836
having, like,
real conversations with people?

1346
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:22,639
You know what I'm saying?
And I hope I'm not going crazy.

1347
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:25,508
PROBST:
Kishan,
it's a fine line because,

1348
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:26,976
as Aysha was saying,

1349
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:29,846
you want to make sure
you're solid,

1350
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:31,347
but if you dip into the well
one more time,

1351
00:57:31,414 --> 00:57:32,849
you might say the wrong thing.

1352
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:34,717
Do you worry about that as well?

1353
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:37,720
KISHAN:
Yes. It's so easy
to get tripped up.

1354
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,055
And that did complicate things,

1355
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,390
which is, I think,
what's causing

1356
00:57:40,456 --> 00:57:42,559
this uneasiness,
because now we're just like,

1357
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,461
"Holy cow. How many
other different conversations

1358
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:47,096
"were happening that

1359
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:49,899
"I wasn't a part of or
someone else wasn't a part of?

1360
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,901
"Maybe if we just took
a step back

1361
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,369
"and kind of kept it
a bit more calm,

1362
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:55,371
maybe those feelings
wouldn't arise."

1363
00:57:55,438 --> 00:58:00,009
Today felt like you're in
this trio of best friends.

1364
00:58:00,076 --> 00:58:02,645
Like, you have a group chat.
You talk every day, right?

1365
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:04,814
Three people.
But then you're just walking.

1366
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:05,949
You know,
you're walking your dogs,

1367
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:07,283
and you look in a restaurant,

1368
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:08,651
and the other two
are having lunch.

1369
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:10,119
And you're like,
"Wait. They didn't put that

1370
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:11,521
"in the group chat.
Like, what's going on?

1371
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:13,523
"Like, I'm so confused.

1372
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:15,058
Do I go up?"
Because I'm a part of this.

1373
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:16,593
Like, I should feel welcome
to come up.

1374
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:20,597
Genevieve, Aysha's example
is straight out of real life.

1375
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:21,965
Sometimes
it's a misunderstanding.

1376
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:24,067
Sometimes there's more to it.

1377
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:27,503
Is that a relatable experience
for you out here?

1378
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:32,141
Yeah. You don't know
what is real and what is not

1379
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:34,177
and what's a bluff and
what is not and who's looking.

1380
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:37,013
Like, you know, Sol's making
eyes at Aysha across the back.

1381
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,781
And you don't know,
like, how much

1382
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:40,817
do I dial in on this or not?

1383
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:43,620
PROBST:
Even you just saying that
now lights up Teeny,

1384
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:47,790
who looks at Sol and says, "Why
are you making eyes at Aysha?"

1385
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,092
You're fighting
for a million dollars.

1386
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:50,827
This is<i> Survivor</i> right here.

1387
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:53,329
You're in the belly
of the beast right now.

1388
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:55,999
We're about to vote.
If you're not playing,

1389
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:58,801
it probably is you, and
it should be you going home.

1390
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:01,471
So, Kishan,
what's your take on this?

1391
00:59:01,537 --> 00:59:03,506
All that cohesion
that we talked about?

1392
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:06,175
Yes, it's nice,
but it's honestly just a facade.

1393
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:09,312
And we pushed it off as long
as we could until we needed to.

1394
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:10,613
And at the end of the day,
we knew

1395
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,749
that one person's name
will be written down,

1396
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:14,217
and they will be voted off.

1397
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:15,551
And that's a harsh reality
that we all knew

1398
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:16,853
when we came in today.

1399
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:23,426
All right, we feel good to vote,
or do we need to talk more?

1400
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:25,194
I just want
to say one more thing.

1401
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:27,597
I don't want
to call anybody out,

1402
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:29,999
but I hope the person
that agreed

1403
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:32,568
to vote with me sticks to that.

1404
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:36,272
Otherwise, I know that I could
be at risk of going home,

1405
