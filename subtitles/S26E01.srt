IT HAS BEEN A SHOWDOWN BETWEEN

00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,662
CORINNE SLIPS OFF.

>> TO ME THE CHALLENGE WITHOUT,

435
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,743
YOU KNOW, BEING THE WINNERS WAS

436
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,870
VERY DISAPPOINTING TO ME.

437
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,329
I HAD SO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN MY

438
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,247
TEAM, SO IT MADE ME, YOU KNOW,

439
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,249
REALIZE THAT, YOU KNOW, I DON'T

440
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,751
HAVE FULL CONTROL OVER THIS GAME

441
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,754
AND THEY JUST HAVE TO DO MY BEST

442
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,714
AND INSPIRE MY TEAMMATES, YOU

443
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,340
KNOW, TO DO A BETTER JOB NEXT

444
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:30,549
TIME.

445
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:35,053
>> WHERE IS OUR THEME MUSIC?

446
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:35,345
>> OH, YEAH.

447
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,930
>> WHAT'S IN THERE?

448
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:37,681
>> RICE.

449
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:38,098
>> OH, THANK GOD!

450
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,435
>> WHEN WE SAW THE FLAG WE SAW

451
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,686
THE MACHETE AND THE BAG OF RICE

452
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,773
RIGHT THERE, WE ANY QUE IT WAS

453
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:45,981
REAL.

454
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:48,400
WE WERE HOME.

455
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,610
THIS BEAUTIFUL ISLAND WAS GOING

456
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,612
TO BE OUR HOME FOR THE NEXT 35

457
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:51,820
DAYS.

458
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:52,821
>> WE NEED WATER.

459
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,573
WE NEED TO START A FIRE.

460
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,575
SHELTER IS GREAT, BUT IF WE

461
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,034
DEHYDRATE, WE'LL DIE.

462
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,994
>> WE ALL HAD ONE CANISTER OF

463
00:17:59,077 --> 00:17:59,578
WATER, AND IT WAS PRETTY MUCH

464
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,663
GONE AND WE REALIZED WE HAD TO

465
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,247
MAKE FIRE TO BE ABLE TO BOIL

466
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,458
WATER OR I MEAN WE WOULDN'T MAKE

467
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,417
IT TWO DAYS.

468
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,795
>> TO ME, SHELTER IS JUST AS

469
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:08,796
IMPORTANT AS FIRE.

470
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,465
AND THERE'S 10 PEOPLE ON OUR

471
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,090
TRIBE.

472
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,676
SO I'M JUST GOING TO DO MY THING

473
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:21,600
AND SEE HOW IT PLAYS OUT.

474
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:31,401
>> I'VE NEVER SEEN TWO PRETTIER

475
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:31,693
SUNBURNS.

476
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,947
>> THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A

477
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:35,405
PRETTY SUNBURN.

478
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,241
>> YOU GUYS PUT A LOT OF ENERGY

479
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,367
INTO THAT ( BLEEP ) THAT WE

480
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,952
DON'T NEED RIGHT NOW.

481
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:40,536
>> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

482
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,872
>> WE NEED FIRE, MAN.

483
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,833
>> THERE ARE CAN'T BE--

484
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,876
>> YOU GUYS HAVE ENERGY, PUT IT

485
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,293
TOWARD THE FIRE.

486
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,294
>> I'M NOT A FIRE MAKER.

487
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,964
I'M A SHELTER MAKER.

488
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,882
EVERYONE'S GOT THEIR JOB TO DO.

489
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:54,049
AND--

490
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:57,177
>> I WANT A DAMN SHELTER, I WANT

491
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,680
WATER, I WANT ALL OF IT BUT IF

492
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:00,722
SOMEONE DOESN'T WORK ON THE

493
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,807
SHELTER, THEN IT'S NOT GOING TO

494
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,057
GET DONE.

495
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,225
>> DO WHAT YOU WILL, MAN.

496
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,394
>> DIEWRKD I'M WORKING ON

497
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:05,644
SHELTER.

498
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,771
I'VE BEEN BUSTING MY ASS.

499
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,314
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU LIFT ONE

500
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:09,940
SINGLE FINGER.

501
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:13,151
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU LIFT A BAMBOO

502
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:13,902
OR CHOP ANYTHING.

503
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,195
I KIND OF HAD HIGHER

504
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,029
EXPECTATIONS FROM A MARINE.

505
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,948
>> MATT, YOU'RE DOING GREAT,

506
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:18,115
MAN.

507
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:18,824
>> I KNOW.

508
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:22,536
I FEEL LIKE I'M BUSTING MY ASS,

509
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,078
WHILE YOU'RE SITTING THERE.

510
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:24,872
>> WHO IS GETTING DOGGED?

511
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,123
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, THOUGH?

512
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,374
WHAT ARE YOU REALLY DOING,

513
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:27,583
THOUGH?

514
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,042
WHAT HAVE YOU ACCOMPLISHED?

515
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,794
OH, I THINK YOU'RE GETTING ON

516
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:30,961
ME!

517
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:31,837
I THINK YOU'RE SAYING THIS!

518
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,922
AND I THINK YOU'RE SAYING THAT.

519
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:34,464
>> I'M A LITTLE BIT WORRIED

520
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,425
ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO SIZE

521
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,093
UP AGAINST THE OTHER TRIBE NOW.

522
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:39,261
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN IMMUNITY

523
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,763
CHALLENGE COMING UP, AND WE'RE

524
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,348
GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE

525
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,766
CAMARADERIE IN CAMP OR ELSE

526
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,518
THINGS ARE GOING TO GET UGLY

527
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:46,727
QUICK.

528
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,352
>> DON'T NEED--

529
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,604
>> ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

530
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,189
>> SHUT UP!

531
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,275
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU!

532
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,286
>> LANDING ON THIS BEACH, IT WAS

533
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,579
A LITTLE SURREAL, AND I'M

534
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:06,914
THINKING I'VE HAD THIS

535
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:07,205
EXPERIENCE.

536
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:07,831
I WAS WALKING ON A BEACH AND WE

537
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,667
WERE FINDING OUR CAMP.

538
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,668
DEFINITELY DIFFERENT AS FAR AS

539
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:12,502
THE ISLAND.

540
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,545
>> OH, SORRY.

541
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,297
>> I MEAN, THIS IS DINOSAURS OR

542
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:15,547
SOMETHING.

543
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,965
I MEAN, THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

544
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,675
>> THIS REALLY HAS A WAY OF

545
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,177
MAKING YOU FEEL UNATHLETIC.

546
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:20,469
>> YEAH.

547
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,387
>> I CAN'T EVEN WALK RIGHT NOW.

548
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,724
>> AS THE NEW KID ON THE BLOCK,

549
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,851
KIND OF, MY ROLE THE FIRST FEW

550
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,519
DAYS IS RAIL IMPRESSION

551
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:29,811
MANAGEMENT.

552
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,646
LUCKILY, I MANAGED TO WIN THE

553
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,148
GAME POINT AND WON US THE FLINT

554
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:35,192
AND THE BEANS, AND SO I GOT TO

555
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,401
MAKE A GREAT FIRST IMPRESSION ON

556
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,070
THE TRIBE, WHICH IS ACTUALLY

557
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,948
GREAT FOR MY STRATEGIC GAME.

558
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,908
>> THE FIRST TIME YOU COME OUT,

559
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,076
YOU'RE SO UNSURE.

560
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,576
THERE'S SO MUCH UNKNOWN.

561
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,495
YOU'RE WONDERING CAN I SURVIVE

562
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,080
THE HUMIDITY.

563
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:48,580
I CAN SURVIVE THE HEAT?

564
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,332
I CAN SURVIVE STARVATION?

565
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,125
CAN I DO IT?

566
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,627
I ALREADY KNOW I CAN DO IT.

567
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,420
THIS TIME WHEN I HIT THE BEACH I

568
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,214
WAS PROBABLY LIKE MY FATHER WHEN

569
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:01,426
HE WENT TO IWO JIMA IN WORLD WAR

570
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:01,593
II.

571
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,387
THEY WERE READY TO DEAL WITH

572
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,888
WHATEVER THEY HAD TO DEAL WITH.

573
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:05,514
IT WAS AWESOME FOR ME WHEN I

574
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,850
FIRST HIT THAT BEACH KNOWING I'M

575
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:17,651
READY, BABY.

576
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,778
>> PHILLIP, WHAT'S THE PLAN?

577
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:20,988
>> WHAT PLAN?

578
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:21,947
>> LIKE THE SHELTER PLAN?

579
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,991
>> MY PREFERENCE IS THIS IS

580
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,409
VERY, VERY TEMPORARY.

581
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,285
FOR ME I WANT TO BE FACING THE

582
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,204
OCEAN WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE

583
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:29,788
MORNING UPON I WANT TO LOOK AT

584
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:30,497
THE OCEAN.

585
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,832
>> YOU CAN JUST TURN YOUR HEAD.

586
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:32,040
>> NO.

587
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,917
>> YOU CAN GO LIKE THIS AND THEN

588
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:34,209
LIKE THAT.

589
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:34,626
>> TRUE.

590
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,377
>> LOOKING AT PHILLIP NOW, IT'S

591
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,879
HARD TO READ HIM.

592
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,298
I MEAN, I PRETTY MUCH STAND BY

593
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,717
MY INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF HIM AS

594
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,635
A CRAZY PERSON.

595
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,594
UM, BUT I'M HOPING THE FACT THAT

596
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,513
I WAS THE FIRST PERSON OUT MY

597
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,348
FIRST SEASON IS GOING TO WORK TO

598
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,933
MY ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THEY'RE

599
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,184
MUCH BIGGER THREAT IN THE GAME,

600
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,311
SO WHEN THEY'RE LOOK AROUND AND

601
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:53,937
WONDERING, YOU KNOW, WHO DO THEY

602
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,356
NEED TO BE WORRIED ABOUT,

603
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,482
HOPEFULLY THEY WON'T BE THINKING

604
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:57,941
ABOUT ME.

605
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,110
>> WHAT ARE YOU GUYS THINKING?

606
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:00,652
>> IN TERMS OF?

607
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,612
>> BIG PICTURE-SMALL PICTURE.

608
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,156
>> WE HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER?

609
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,282
>> YEAH.

610
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,158
>> YOU'RE LOYAL.

611
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:06,825
>> NO QUESTION.

612
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:07,159
>> TO A FAULT.

613
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,244
>> I RAIL WANT TO WORK WITH YOU.

614
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:09,619
>> YEAH.

615
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,455
>> SO I THINK, OKAY, US THREE

616
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:12,497
FOR SURE.

617
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,917
AND THEN I KNOW THAT COCHRAN IS

618
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:16,334
SO LOYAL.

619
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,295
>> COCHRAN WOULD STAY LOYAL TO

620
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:18,462
US.

621
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,630
>> HE WOULD, MAYBE US THREE--

622
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,424
ARE YOU SIT ON GETTING PHILLIP

623
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,216
OUT RIGHT AWAY?

624
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,468
>> I GUESS I WAS A LITTLE

625
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:30,098
TRAUMATIZED BY HAVING A REAL BAD

626
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,266
MINORITY LINE WHEN I FIRST

627
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,392
PLAYED AND NOW I'M LIKE I'M

628
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,685
GOING TO ALIGN WITH EVERYBODY.

629
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,937
>> US THREE, COCHRAN, BRANDON,

630
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:36,730
PHILLIP, THERE'S SIX.

631
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:37,731
>> OH, GOD!

632
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:38,523
>> LIKE PROBABLY--

633
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,568
>> LET'S NOT GET AHEAD OF OURS.

634
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:42,652
YOU KNOW, I THINK A LOT OF

635
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:43,820
PEOPLE THINK THAT MY FIRST

636
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,489
SEASON I GOT KIND OF A RAW DEAL

637
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,366
AND GOT STUCK IN AN IMPOSSIBLE

638
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,993
SITUATION, WHICH I TOTALLY

639
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:50,702
AGREE.

640
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:51,620
AND SO I'VE GOT TO PROVE THAT

641
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,789
THAT'S THE CASE AND THAT I

642
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,874
ACTUALLY CAN PLAY THIS GAME AND,

643
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:58,376
YOU KNOW, BE SMART ABOUT IT AND

644
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,003
BE COMPETITIVE AND MAKE THE

645
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,171
RIGHT RELATIONSHIPS AND GET

646
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:03,173
ALONG WITH PEOPLE AND BE A

647
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,759
SERIOUS THREAT IN THIS GAME.

648
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,594
I GUESS I WANT TO START OUT BY

649
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:08,470
SAYING THAT, YOU KNOW, EVEN

650
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,598
THOUGH WE DIDN'T GET ALONG SO

651
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:11,890
WELL.

652
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:12,140
>> UH-HUH.

653
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,934
>> THE FIRST TIME WE PLAYED

654
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,477
TOGETHER, YOU KNOW, I WAS NEVER

655
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,603
GUNNING FOR YOU.

656
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,272
AND I KNOW THAT YOU THOUGHT THAT

657
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:22,067
I WAS, BUT I HOPE YOU KNOW NOW

658
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,069
THAT WHEN I TOLD YOU THAT I

659
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:27,989
WASN'T, I WAS TELL YOU THE

660
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,076
TRUTH.

661
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,662
>> I'M GOING TO LET FRANCESCA BE

662
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:33,912
FRANCESCA.

663
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,705
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS I

664
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,249
BURIED THE HATCHET WITH HER WHEN

665
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,542
SHE CAME UP TO ME HERE AND HAD A

666
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,043
CONVERSATION WITH ME, I REALIZE

667
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,837
SHE'S STUCK IN A TIME WARP.

668
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:47,342
I JUST THINK THAT-- SHE ANNOYS

669
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:48,635
ME GREATLY.

670
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,594
WE'RE PLAYING A NEW GAME.

671
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,637
>> YEAH.

672
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,055
>> BE SMART ABOUT IT.

673
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,640
>> NO, THAT'S ALL-- THAT'S WHAT

674
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:54,432
I'M TRYING TO DO.

675
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,642
>> TODAY, WE'RE ON THE SAME

676
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:55,934
TEAM.

677
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:56,184
>> YEAH.

678
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:56,852
>> OKAY?

679
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,228
>> THAT'S HOW I FEEL,

680
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:58,520
ABSOLUTELY.

681
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,521
>> WE'VE GOT A JOB TO DO.

682
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,063
>> FILL.

683
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,232
AND I I HAD OUR FIRST

684
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:02,566
CONVERSATION.

685
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:02,899
IT WAS FINE.

686
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:03,650
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I RESIGNED

687
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,944
MYSELF TO JUST PLAYING REALLY

688
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,070
NICE WITH PHILLIP.

689
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,071
BUT, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.

690
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:08,655
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S

691
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,740
GOING TO BE GUNNING FOR ME.

692
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:13,076
I'M NOT GUNNING FOR HIM.

693
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,495
SO IF I AM VOTED OFF FIRST A

694
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:19,875
SECOND TIME, I WILL EAT-- THIS

695
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:20,250
ROCK.

696
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,334
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

697
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,650
>> GETTING VOTED OUT IS ONE

698
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,819
THING, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO SIT

699
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,779
UP HERE AND BE THE GUY WHO GOES

700
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,531
OUT FOR DEHYDRATION.

701
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,575
THAT'S NOT, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING

702
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,493
THEY COULD HAVE LIVED WITH, SO I

703
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,453
JUST STARTED LOOKING AT PEOPLE

704
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:57,579
MAKE THE FIRE AND I STARTED

705
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,540
SEEING WHERE THEY WERE GOING

706
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:00,749
WRONG.

707
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,667
>> DIDT GOT WARM BUT IT BARELY

708
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:02,918
BURNED.

709
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,961
>> I SAT BACK ON THE LOG AND I

710
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,087
WAS LIKE ALL RIGHT SO I NEED

711
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,088
THIS KIND OF WOOD.

712
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:07,881
I NEED TO DO THIS.

713
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:08,590
I NEED TO DO THAT.

714
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:09,716
>> THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

715
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:14,262
>> THIS HOLE IS TOO BIG FOR ME,

716
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:14,429
MAN.

717
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:16,139
WE'LL USE THIS WOOD RIGHT HERE,

718
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,183
CUT A LITTLE RIVET IN IT.

719
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,267
I'M GOING TO BE THE MARINE WHO

720
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,727
CAME IN AT THE END AND SMASHED

721
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,228
THEM.

722
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,896
ONCE IT STARTS SMOKING, LIGHT

723
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,981
BLOWS, AND WE CAN MAKE IT

724
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:25,899
HAPPEN.

725
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:26,233
WE, FOR REAL.

726
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,234
>> I LIKE THAT.

727
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:36,952
>> WE CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

728
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:37,619
>> WE'RE GOOD.

729
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,121
>> YOU'RE COMFORTABLE, RIGHT?

730
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:44,793
>> UH-HUH.

731
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:48,171
>> HELLO?

732
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:48,755
>> I SEE AN EMBER.

733
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,882
I SEE AN EMBER.

734
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,926
KEEP GOING.

735
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:56,054
FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

736
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:56,263
EMBER.

737
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,889
>> HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

738
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,724
>> HELP!

739
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,809
>> KEEP IT EASY.

740
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,561
THE OTHER SIDE.

741
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,523
>> KEEP IT GOING.

742
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,108
>> OKAY.

743
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,567
>> YEAH!

744
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,610
>> GET SOME WOOD.

745
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,363
>> OKAY, GUYS, GET SOME MORE,

746
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,447
GET SOME MORE.

747
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,950
>> KEEP BLOWING IT, KEEP BLOWING

748
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:17,117
IT.

749
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,328
>> IF WE GOT DEHYDRATED JUST OFF

750
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,706
THE FIRE, I KNEW WE HAD WATER

751
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:23,790
AROUND THE CORNER.

752
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,667
I HAD TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

753
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,876
IT WAS LIKE BEING IN IRAQ AND

754
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,336
HAVING TO GET HOME.

755
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,337
IT JUST HAD TO HAPPEN.

756
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,505
>> YEAH!

757
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:31,715
>> LOOK AT MY FACE.

758
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,551
DIDN'T I TELL YOU?

759
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:35,302
DIDN'T I TELL YOU?

760
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,095
>> SIGNS SAW EVERYONE OVER BY

761
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,180
THE FIRE, I KNEW THAT IT WAS

762
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:39,639
GREAT NEWS.

763
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:40,640
OBVIOUSLY, WE NEED FIRE.

764
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,017
I WAS EXTREMELY HAPPY.

765
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,518
>> I LOAF YOU, MAN.

766
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:43,852
I LOVE YOU.

767
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,937
>> I SMOOTH IT OVER WITH SHAMAR.

768
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:46,980
WE SHOOK HAND.

769
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:47,647
SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA GIVE A GUY

770
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,817
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT, A

771
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:57,949
LITTLE BIT.

772
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,708
♪ ♪ ♪

773
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,084
>> OH, MY GOD.

774
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:11,087
I NEED A SECOND SCOOP, AFTER

775
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,798
EVERYBODY HAS HAD SOME.

776
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,342
IT'S CRISPY HEAVEN!

777
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:15,925
>> WE'RE HAPPY SEE YOU HAPPY.

778
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,386
>> WE HAVE SUCH A GOOD CROWD.

779
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,387
WHEN I LOOK AT EVERYBODY IN

780
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:19,929
THERE, I'M THINKING THIS IS

781
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,182
GOING TO BE A GOOD GAME.

782
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:22,807
I THOUGHT SOME THINGS I LEARNED

783
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,393
FROM BOSTON ROB MIGHT COME TO

784
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:25,935
THEY PLAYWORKING WITH THIS

785
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:26,144
GROUP.

786
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:28,813
I CREATED SOMETHING CALLED "THE

787
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:29,898
B.R. RULES."

788
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,609
B.R. RULE ONE WOULD BE BE IN AN

789
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:32,901
ALLIANCE.

790
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:36,571
RULE TWO, BE AN ALLIANCE WITHIN

791
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:37,614
A ALLIANCE.

792
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,408
RULE THREE, GET RID OF YOUR

793
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,701
ALLIANCE BEFORE THEY GET RID OF

794
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:41,868
YOU.

795
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,745
AND YOU DON'T OWE ANYBODY

796
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:43,995
ANYTHING.

797
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,664
IT'S ALL ABOUT FAMILY.

798
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:47,207
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

799
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,124
>> TELL ME.

800
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,001
>> WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TRY TO

801
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:50,877
DO WITH YOU, GET IN AN ALLIANCE

802
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,713
EARLY AND I WOULD LIKE TO GET

803
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:54,130
MALCOLM AND ANDREA.

804
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,298
>> I'M IN.

805
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:55,590
I LOVE IT.

806
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:58,051
>> I'M PLAYING A DIFFERENT

807
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:58,468
STRATEGY THIS TIME.

808
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,011
FIRST OF ALL, FIND TWO PEOPLE

809
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:00,929
THAT ARE VERY EFFICIENT AT

810
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,889
DOMINATING THE TRIBE, MAKING

811
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,140
SURE WE HAVE THE NUMBERS.

812
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,434
I PICK CORINNE.

813
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,854
I GAVE EVERYONE A NAME, YOU'RE

814
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:10,146
DOMINATRIX.

815
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,898
CORINNE IS A TAKE CHARGE TYPE OF

816
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:12,107
PERSON.

817
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:12,774
AND ANDREA, BECAUSE I KNEW HER.

818
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,777
I KNEW HER TO BE A STRATEGIST.

819
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,739
>> IF WE WANTED TO GO, LIKE, US,

820
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:23,910
AND FILM, THE STRONGER PEOPLE SO

821
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,036
WE DON'T TOTALLY SUCK.

822
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:25,787
>> I'M FOR IT.

823
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,414
>> PART OF MY STRATEGY WAS TO

824
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,290
HAVE TWO PEOPLE LIKE THAT.

825
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,083
MALCOLM IS IN.

826
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:30,375
I WANT DAWN.

827
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,127
I WOULD BE IN THE BACKGROUND.

828
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,629
BECAUSE I AM BEING STEALTH, THE

829
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:35,213
UNDERCOVER BROTHER, FOR SURE,

830
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:38,133
THE SPECIALIST, BEHIND THE

831
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:38,883
SCENES, GIVING DIRECTION,

832
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,553
WITHOUT MAKING IT SO

833
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,012
EVERYBODY, EXCEPT MY CORE

834
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:43,304
ALLIANCE.

835
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,306
I LOOK AT YOU, AND YOU OF I SEE

836
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:45,849
HOW YOU PLAY THE GAME.

837
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:49,853
HENCE, YOU'RE THE INTELLIGENTIA

838
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:50,103
ATTACHE.

839
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,438
I HAVE GONE OUT AND RECRUITED

840
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:51,729
SIX PEOPLE.

841
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:52,480
>> HAVING FUN?

842
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,481
>> GOOD.

843
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,192
I'M HAVING FUN, TOO.

844
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,277
BUT I'M LOOK AT ERIK.

845
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,570
THERE'S SOMETHING THERE THAT I

846
00:28:58,653 --> 00:28:58,778
LIKE.

847
00:28:58,862 --> 00:28:59,988
RIGHT NOW I THINK I HAVE THE

848
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,364
NUMBERS WHERE IF I DIDN'T BRING

849
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,658
YOU IN, LET'S SAY, FOR EXAMPLE,

850
00:29:03,741 --> 00:29:06,119
PEOPLE I'M ALIGNED WITH COULD

851
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:06,661
STILL CONTROL THINGS HERE.

852
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:07,787
>> GOTCHA.

853
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,039
>> BUT I WANT YOU IN.

854
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,792
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T GET

855
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:13,001
NERVOUS.

856
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,586
>> SOMETIMES I DO GET A LITTLE

857
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:14,919
NERVOUS, BUT--

858
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,671
>> IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE YOU TO

859
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:18,381
COMPLETELY TRUST ME 100%.

860
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,717
>> GO AHEAD, GO AHEAD.

861
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,426
SORRY, SORRY.

862
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:22,010
YOU'RE GOING TO TRUST SOMEBODY

863
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,720
OUT HERE, ANYWAY.

864
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:24,429
>> I KNOW.

865
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,139
I KNOW HOW IT GOES.

866
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:26,764
FAIR ENOUGH.

867
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:27,265
>> I DON'T WANT TO BRING

868
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,641
SOMEBODY TO THE PARTY THAT DON'T

869
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:29,100
WANT TO COME.

870
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,810
AND BY THE WAY, I'M JUST THE

871
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:31,060
MESSENGER.

872
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:31,728
I WAS SENT.

873
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:32,604
I'M AN ERRAND BOY.

874
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:32,937
>> ALL RIGHT.

875
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,189
>> SO DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING

876
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:34,856
TO RUN BACK THERE AND SAY,

877
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,399
"GUESS WHAT?"

878
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,442
YOU HAVE THE WRONG PERSON.

879
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:40,320
>> PHILLIP BASICALLY SAID TO ME,

880
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,905
"YOU'RE WITH ME OR YOU'RE OUT."

881
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,531
IT'S NOT EVEN A CHOICE, WHICH

882
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:43,948
DRIVES ME NUTS.

883
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,867
THE FACT THAT HE CAME TO ME WITH

884
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,994
THIS FEAR MENTALITY WITH A

885
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,412
BOSTON ROB STYLE, I DON'T WANT

886
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,371
TO BE WITH HIM.

887
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,832
HE'S A COMBATIVE IDIOT LOSER WHO

888
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:58,880
MAKES EVERYBODY CRAZY.

889
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,145
>> PRETTY CLEAR WE HAVE TO STICK

890
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:14,395
TOGETHER.

891
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,396
>> YEAH, YEAH.

892
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:15,688
YOU AND I.

893
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:16,397
>> YEAH.

894
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,024
>> ARE A HUNTED SPECIES OUT

895
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:18,233
HERE.

896
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,359
>> I KNOW.

897
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:19,984
WE'RE DEFINITELY TARGETS ON OUR

898
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:20,902
BACK.

899
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:25,198
>> WE'D BE STUPID NOT TO.

900
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:25,823
>> YEAH.

901
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,283
>> SO THAT WAS COOL WE GOT

902
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,034
PAIRED UP IN IMMUNITY CHALLENGE

903
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:28,243
TODAY.

904
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,036
>> YEAH, THAT WAS AWESOME.

905
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,496
>> I DEFINITELY WANT TO BE WITH

906
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:31,663
YOU.

907
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:32,580
>> ME, TOO.

908
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,583
>> I MEAN, I THINK IF WE JUST

909
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,125
WATCH OUT FOR EACH OTHER, NO

910
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,253
MATTER WHAT, CRAZY ALLIANCES ARE

911
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,046
GOING TO HAPPEN AND GET BROKEN.

912
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,422
LIKE, I'M TALKING ABOUT ALL THE

913
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,298
WAY TO THE LAST TWO.

914
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,801
>> ME AND YOU TO THE LAST TWO.

915
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:45,468
SWEAR TO GOD?

916
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,136
>> SWEAR TO GOD.

917
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,430
I THINK IT WAS SERENDIPITOUS

918
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,724
THAT I GOT PAIRED UP WITH ALY IN

919
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:52,559
THE CHALLENGE.

920
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:53,935
WE SHOULD ACT LIKE WE ARE

921
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,520
GETTING ROCKS WHICH WE ARE.

922
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,939
I KNEW THE GUYS WOULD WANT TO

923
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,524
PAIR UP WITH ME AND THERE'S NO

924
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:00,817
PRESSURE TO THAT.

925
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,320
BUT WHAT I NEEDED INSTANTLY WAS

926
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,697
SOMEBODY WHO WAS NOT OBVIOUS.

927
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,657
AND I THINK SHE'S AN OBVIOUS

928
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:07,907
CHOICE.

929
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,242
SHE KIND OF FLIES UNDER THE

930
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:09,450
RADAR.

931
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,660
SHE'S NOT THE CUTEST.

932
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,328
SHE'S NOT THE ANYTHING.

933
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,247
SHE'S JUST COOL AND LIKABLE.

934
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,957
#-R I'M NOT.

935
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,375
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SCREW ME

936
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:17,709
OVER, ARE YOU?

937
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:18,585
>> PROMISE.

938
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,044
>> "SURVIVOR" IS A GAME OF GUT

939
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,422
INSTINCT, AND RIGHT NOW MY GUT

940
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,090
FEELS GOOD.

941
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:32,974
AND I THINK HERS DOES, TOO.

942
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,602
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY

943
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:36,436
STARS ARE OUT.

944
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,270
>> I KNOW.

945
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:37,604
>> IT'S WILD.

946
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,772
>> YOU CAN SEE SO MANY MORE OUT

947
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:39,981
HERE.

948
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,691
>> IT'S LIKE MY BEDROOM WHEN I

949
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:42,775
WAS A CHILD.

950
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,027
>> MINE ARE STILL UP, I THINK.

951
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,696
>> I'LL FEELING NOSTALGIC.

952
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:47,280
SO WE'RE STICKING TOGETHER.

953
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:48,114
>> UM.

954
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,408
>> I'M ONLY ASKING BECAUSE I

955
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,327
LIKE TO THINK THIS WE HAVE,

956
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,161
LIKE, A CONNECTION.

957
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,121
>> THAT'S BECAUSE WE'RE THE ONLY

958
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,122
TWO WHO--

959
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:58,041
>> ME AND HOPE ARE THE TWO

960
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,168
BESTED LOOKING PEOPLE HERE, I

961
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:00,543
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

962
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,128
I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT.

963
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,463
THAT'S HOW IT IS.

964
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:04,672
AS SOON AS WE GOT OFF THE BOAT

965
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,174
WE WERE PARTNERS WITH THE

966
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:06,466
CHALLENGE.

967
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:07,383
AND I'M LIKE I'M GOING TO WORK

968
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:07,675
WITH YOU.

969
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,260
AND SHE'S LIKE I'M GOING TO WORK

970
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,053
WITH YOU.

971
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,220
SO WE'RE STICKING TOGETHER.

972
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,640
>> YEAH, I MEAN, THAT'S THE

973
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:14,641
PLAN.

974
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,142
ME, YOU... I DON'T KNOW.

975
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:16,392
WHO ELSE?

976
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:19,062
>> I LIKE REYNOLD.

977
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:19,687
HE'S MY BOY.

978
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,022
>> I DO, TOO.

979
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,940
>> I LIKE ALLIE.

980
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:23,316
>> YEAH.

981
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:26,402
>> HOPE, SHE'S LIKE A LITTLE

982
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,111
SOUTHERN BELLE.

983
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,781
THAT'S WHAT I LOOKING FOR-- I

984
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,032
DON'T KNOW IF I'M LOOKING TO

985
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:31,699
SLOW DANCE.

986
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,202
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FUN.

987
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,078
YOU'RE MY SOUTHERN BELLE FOR THE

988
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,829
NEXT MONTH.

989
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:42,460
I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME.

990
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,545
>> THE FIRST NIGHT, EVERYBODY

991
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,255
WAS REALLY JUST LOOKING FOR BODY

992
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,132
WARMTH, SO IT WAS JUST LIKE WE

993
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:53,513
WERE ALL PILING IN.

994
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,306
BUT I DID NOTICE BECAUSE I WAS

995
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,183
SLEEPING NEXT TO REYNOLD AND

996
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,810
ALLIE, THAT THEIR CUDDLING WAS A

997
00:32:58,893 --> 00:32:59,602
LITTLE BIT MORE.

998
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,604
I NOTICED A LITTLE BIT MORE ARMS

999
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:01,938
LOCKED AROUND.

1000
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,107
YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T JUST A BODY

1001
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:07,193
WARMTH THING.

1002
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:10,196
NOT A SMART MOVE.

1003
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:13,074
ROMANTIC ALLIANCES DO NOT WORK

1004
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,325
ON "SURVIVOR."

1005
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,660
YOU'RE GOING TO GET TARGETED

1006
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,035
RIGHT AWAY.

1007
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,018
>> IT'S HOT RIGHT NOW, RIGHT?

1008
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:41,686
>> IT'S REALLY HOT.

1009
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,480
>> I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I

1010
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,566
ONLY ASK BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE

1011
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:47,275
SURE I'M NOT FEEFERLISHLY--

1012
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,569
>> NO IT'S HOT.

1013
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:49,944
IT'S REALLY HOT.

1014
00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:52,947
>> WHETHER-WISE, THIS IS NOT MY

1015
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:53,239
ENVIRONMENT.

1016
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,115
I WAS NOT AWARE HOW QUICKLY I

1017
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,409
CAN BECOME SUNBURNED.

1018
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,119
THE SUN IS CONSTANTLY ROASTING

1019
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:58,369
YOU.

1020
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,247
MY ENTIRE BODY, HEAD TO TOE--

1021
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,499
LITERALLY, MY TOES ARE

1022
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:03,791
SUNBURNED.

1023
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,792
>> OH, MY GOSH!

1024
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,378
>> HOW IS THAT HAPPENING?

1025
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:07,795
THEY'RE SO SWOLLEN.

1026
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,298
>> LOOK AT HIS FEET.

1027
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,924
THEY'RE SWOLLEN.

1028
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,134
>> OH, MAN, THAT'S BAD.

1029
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,969
>> THEY FEEL VERY, VERY TIGHT.

1030
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:16,512
I GUESS THEY ARE SWOLLEN.

1031
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,849
>> COCHRAN IS LIKE A LITTLE

1032
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:20,725
TOMATO RIGHT NOW.

1033
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:23,561
HE IS ALL BRIGHT RED ALL OVER

1034
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,897
THE PLACE AND HE IS SWOLLEN LIKE

1035
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,773
A LITTLE PREGNANT LADY.

1036
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:27,857
>> I CAN'T MOVE.

1037
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,900
I'M BURNING.

1038
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,276
WHEN I MOVE I GET EXHAUSTED.

1039
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,944
IF WE HAD A CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW,

1040
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:32,320
I'D ACTUALLY DIE.

1041
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,322
I'M TRYING TO PUT ON A BRAVE

1042
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:38,284
FACE, MAYBE MAKE SOME

1043
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,161
SELF-DEPRECATING COMMENTS AROUND

1044
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,205
CAMP-- OH, YEAH, I LOOK LIKE A

1045
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,122
LOBSTER, I LOOK LIKE A FREAK.

1046
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,333
I'M IN PAIN RIGHT NOW.

1047
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,752
I'M TRYING TO STAY STRONG.

1048
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:51,172
MY NEW PERSONA IS STRONG, A

1049
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,048
LITTLE SWAGGER.

1050
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,341
I CAN'T BE THE SAME FREAK I WAS

1051
00:34:53,424 --> 00:35:02,350
LAST TIME.

1052
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,310
>> OUTSIDE OF THIS ISLAND, I

1053
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,479
WOULD HANG OUT WITH YOU GUYS.

1054
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:07,021
>> YEAH.

1055
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,564
>> YEAH THE SAME.

1056
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,607
>> IT FEELS MORE NATURAL.

1057
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,566
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF HOURS IN

1058
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,234
THE DAY.

1059
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,485
STRATEGY OR NO STRATEGY, YOU

1060
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:13,861
HAVE TO HANG OUT.

1061
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,489
ALLIE AND I I HAD A LITTLE

1062
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,115
CUDDLE SESSION LAST NIGHT, AND A

1063
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,117
LOT IS COMMUNICATED THROUGH THE

1064
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:20,368
CUDDLE.

1065
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,286
SO NOW WE KIND OF HAVE THIS FOUR

1066
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,455
WITH ME, EDDIE, ALLIE, AND HOPE.

1067
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,748
SO IT'S ALL KIND OF WORKED OUT.

1068
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,209
>> WE'RE ALL GOING TOW TRY NOT

1069
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,794
TO BE CLICHE AND HAVE THE COOL

1070
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,170
KIDS HANG OUT, BUT IT HAPPENS.

1071
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,798
>> HOLLY ALL OVER AGAIN.

1072
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:34,340
>> OH!

1073
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:35,424
>> THAT'S TRUE, THOUGH.

1074
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,218
>> BUT IT IS TRUE.

1075
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,261
>> THIS IS, LIKE THE COOL KID

1076
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:40,263
LUNCH TABLE BACK AT HOLLY.

1077
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:42,223
EVERYBODY WANTS TO SIT AT THE

1078
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:42,682
COOL KID LUNCH TABLE.

1079
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:46,477
YOU HAVE TO WORK YOUR WAY IN.

1080
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,228
BUT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ELSE

1081
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,438
IS GOING TO BE AT OUR TABLE.

1082
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,773
>> I'M NOT KIDDING.

1083
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,441
>> DID YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT A

1084
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,442
WEIRD VIBE THIS MORNING?

1085
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:54,152
>> UH-HUH.

1086
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:54,777
>> YEAH.

1087
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:55,403
>> I THINK SLEEPING SITUATIONS

1088
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,530
KIND OF SAID A LOT LAST NIGHT.

1089
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,698
>> I AGREE.

1090
00:35:58,781 --> 00:35:59,282
>> THERE'S LOTS OF SNUGGLING

1091
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,033
GOING ON LAST NIGHT.

1092
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:04,829
IT WASN'T JUST A, "I'M STAYING

1093
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:07,290
WARM," KIND OF CUDDLE, SNUGGLE

1094
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:07,623
KIND OF THING.

1095
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:08,916
THEY WERE HOOK UP.

1096
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,251
WE HAVE TO BREAK UP THE COUPLE.

1097
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,794
>> I DEFINITELY DON'T THINK I'LL

1098
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,462
BE ABLE TO GET CLOSE WITH THOSE

1099
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:13,671
FOUR.

1100
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:14,380
>> OKAY, I'M WITH YOU.

1101
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:18,801
>> GUYS, GUYSES, I'M 100%.

1102
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,261
>> REAL QUICK, REAL QUICK.

1103
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,596
>> OKAY.

1104
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,140
>> I TOLD THE LADIES THAT I WAS

1105
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,016
WITH HEM.

1106
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,767
"OH, YEAH, I'M WITH YOU GUYS."

1107
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,352
BUT I'M TRYING TO SET MYSELF UP

1108
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,772
SO THAT I CAN BE HIP TO EITHER

1109
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,108
DIRECTION BECAUSE I WANT TO GO

1110
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:38,237
WHERE IT'S BEST FOR ME.

1111
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:42,116
>> THIS THING ON MY LEC IS ALL

1112
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:44,410
BALDNESS, LIKE A WIZARD ZORB.

1113
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,120
>> OH, MY GOD.

1114
00:36:46,203 --> 00:36:47,246
>> MATT AND I, WE BOTH HAVE A

1115
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,498
GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR, I THINK.

1116
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,292
HE'S LAID BACK, AND HE WORKS

1117
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,294
HARD SO WE KIND OF, YOU KNOW,

1118
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,962
VIBE IN CAMP THE SAME WAY.

1119
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,589

GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

1354
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,664
CAMP.

1355
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:27,873
CAMP.

1356
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,833
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

1357
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,085
FANS, NO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

1358
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,086
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.

1359
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,171
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1360
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,359
>> IT WAS A HEARTBREAKER.

1361
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,611
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN BE

1362
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:59,613
CONFIDENT, AND WE WERE

1363
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:00,656
CONFIDENT, BUT THERE'S SUCH A

1364
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,825
THING AS LUCK AND THAT GUY,

1365
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,993
REYNOLD, HE WAS JUST REALLY GOOD

1366
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:08,872
AT TOSSING SANDBAGS INTO HOLES,

1367
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:11,250
APPARENTLY SOME SKILL THAT IF IT

1368
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,043
HAD TAKEN HIM 10 SECONDS LONGER

1369
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,711
WE WOULD HAVE WON.

1370
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:15,671
UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE GOING TO

1371
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:16,672
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

1372
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:19,675
YEAH, SO, THAT SUCKS THAT WE

1373
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:19,883
LOST.

1374
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:25,431
>LOST, BUT I THINK PHILLIP.

1375
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:26,265
>> YEAH.

1376
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:28,809
>> I MEAN, HAVE YOU GUYS TALKED

1377
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:32,354
ABOUT THE GAME AT ALL?

1378
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,939
>> CUTE NICKNAMES AND STUFF BUT

1379
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:38,026
NOT ABOUT ACTUAL GAME PLAY.

1380
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:38,861
HE'S LIKE YOU'RE A SMART MAN.

1381
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:40,279
I RESPECT YOU.

1382
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,614
>> IF WE DIDN'T DO PHILLIP I

1383
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:43,240
LIKE CORINNE.

1384
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:44,658
>> SEE, I LIKE CORINNE.

1385
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:45,784
>> I LIKE HER TOO, IT'S NOT

1386
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:45,993
THAT--

1387
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,870
>> I BROUGHT YOU A WET BUFF.

1388
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:51,540
>>OTS NOT THAT I DON'T LIKE HER,

1389
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:51,957
I DO.

1390
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,418
BUT IF CORINNE HAD COME TO ME

1391
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:55,210
YESTERDAY AND SAID LET'S TALK

1392
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,753
ABOUT THE GAME, WHAT ARE YOU

1393
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:57,004
THINKING?

1394
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,672
THAT WOULD MAKE ME TRUST HER

1395
00:45:58,755 --> 00:45:59,840
MORE BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE MORE

1396
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,592
IN KEEPING WITH WHO I PERCEIVE

1397
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:02,593
HER TO BE.

1398
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:05,179
THE FACT THAT, "EVERYTHING'S

1399
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:05,345
GREAT.

1400
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,680
WE'RE PLAYING SURVIVOR?

1401
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:07,556
WE VOTE PEOPLE OUT?

1402
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:10,350
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT."

1403
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,311
THAT MAKES ME SUSPICIOUS OF HER.

1404
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:14,354
>> YOU NEED TO PUT THAT ON YOUR

1405
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:14,521
HEAD.

1406
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,523
JUST GO LIKE-- GO LIKE THIS.

1407
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,150
>> SQUEEZE IT ON TO YOUR HEAD.

1408
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,318
>> LIKE THIS.

1409
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:22,529
>> OH, MY GOD, THAT IS

1410
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:22,821
DELIGHTFUL!

1411
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,031
I FEEL, LIKE, 10 YEARS YOUNGER.

1412
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:30,120
>> YOU LOOK IT.

1413
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:30,913
THERE IT IS.

1414
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:32,915
>> SUNBURN ASIDE, I HAVE

1415
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,791
BASICALLY INSTANT RAPPORT WITH--

1416
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,960
I SAY EVERYBODY ON MY TRIBE IS

1417
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,462
INTENSELY SATISFYING.

1418
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:41,882
IT'S BASICALLY THE ALOE TO MY

1419
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:42,341
SUNBURN, AS IT WERE.

1420
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:42,966
>> HEY, BRANDON.

1421
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,928
>> HOW ARE YOU GUYS?

1422
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,262
>> GOOD MORNING.

1423
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:50,766
>> HEY.

1424
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,643
>> PHILLIP.

1425
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:52,893
>> OKAY.

1426
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:56,063
>> UNLESS YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT

1427
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,439
IDEA WHO ELSE COULD IT POSSIBLY

1428
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:57,689
BE?

1429
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:58,565
>> GO WITH THE FLOW.

1430
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,817
>> WHAT DOES EVERYONE ELSE

1431
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:01,026
THINK?

1432
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:01,485
WE HAVE ENOUGH, RIGHT?

1433
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:02,027
>> WELL, THIS IS FIVE--

1434
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:05,072
>> IS BRENDAN WITH YOU?

1435
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,823
IS BRENDAN-- NO?

1436
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,951
>> I DON'T THINK THERE'S GOING

1437
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:09,284
TO BE ANYONE.

1438
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:12,037
>> FRANCESCA IS TRICKY FOR ME

1439
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,705
BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE HER.

1440
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:13,997
SHE'S FUNNY.

1441
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,708
I THINK WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD

1442
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:16,917
BOND.

1443
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,753
IT'S JUST-- IT'S HARD BECAUSE WE

1444
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:21,046
TALKED, LIKE, RIGHT AWAY.

1445
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,465
HER, ME, AND DAWN, BUT THEN A

1446
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:24,091
LONG TIME WENT BY AND I DIDN'T

1447
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:24,967
HEAR ANYTHING FROM HER.

1448
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,719
SO SHE HAS HER OWN AGENDA BUT I

1449
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:28,887
THINK I HAVE MORE LOYAL PEOPLE

1450
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:32,182
WITH PHILLIP, SO INSTEAD OF

1451
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,433
FRANCESCA, IT'S ALMOST BETTER TO

1452
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,894
GO THAT WAY.

1453
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:36,937
>> I HEARD STRATEGY TALK.

1454
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,107
AND I'M LIKE I SHOULD TALK TO

1455
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,233
FRANCESCA SO SHE DOESN'T YOU

1456
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,776
KNOW SO SHE THINKS A LOT OF US

1457
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:43,235
ARE ON BOARD WITH HER.

1458
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:44,945
AND I WAS LIKE SO, LIKE, WHAT'S

1459
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:45,112
UP?

1460
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,114
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

1461
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:49,241
AND SHE'S THINKING OF YOU.

1462
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:49,908
LIKE, SHE NEEDS TO GO.

1463
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,577
>> WHAT.

1464
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,119
>> I THINK SHE NEEDS TO GO.

1465
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,329
>> I TOLD YOU.

1466
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,290
SHE'S ALWAYS STRATEGIZING.

1467
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:56,957
SHE DOESN'T WAIT.

1468
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,000
SHE'S NOT PATIENT.

1469
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:58,750
SHE NEEDS TO GO.

1470
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,253
I LIKE THE IDEA OF VOTING

1471
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:02,170
FRANCESCA OUT FIRST AGAIN.

1472
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,131
YOU NEED TO BE LIKE MACHIAVELLI

1473
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:07,217
WHO SAID,, IF YOU COME AT ME

1474
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,135
ONCE, I WILL BURN YOUR VILLAGE.

1475
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:11,054
I WILL KILL YOUR AUNTS, UNCLES

1476
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,431
AND ALL YOUR CHILDREN SO NONE OF

1477
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:17,102
YOUR KIND WILL EXIST AGAIN

1478
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:24,192
OPINION

1479
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:31,950
>> OH!

1480
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:35,495
>> SO I GUESS PHILLIP, HUH?

1481
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,122
>> DEFINITELY.

1482
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:39,249
HE SAID, "I'VE GOT A CHOICE FOR

1483
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:39,541
YOU."

1484
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,084
HE SAID, "YOU'RE EITHER WITH ME,

1485
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,420
OR YOU'RE NOT BUT IF YOU'RE NOT

1486
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,339
WE STILL HAVE THE NUMBERS

1487
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:45,547
ANYWAY."

1488
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,049
SO ME BASICALLY DIDN'T EVEN GET

1489
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:47,341
ME A CHOICE.

1490
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,801
HE SAID, "YOU'RE WITH ME OR

1491
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:50,969
YOU'RE DEAD," BASICALLY.

1492
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,180
HE SCARES ME PHILLIP BASICALLY

1493
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,181
APPROACHED ME ON THE FIRST DAY

1494
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,099
AND HE SAID, "YOU CAN BE WITH ME

1495
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:59,061
AND WE HAVE THE NUMBERS OR CAN

1496
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,354
BE AGAINST ME, AND I HAVE THE

1497
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:01,188
NUMBERS ANYWAY."

1498
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,105
MAYBE HE DOES HAVE THE NUMBERS.

1499
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,982
MAYBE PHILLIP DOES HAVE ENOUGH

1500
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,275
PEOPLE THAT HE CAN CONTROL THE

1501
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,027
GAME, BUT I'M NOT SURE WHAT

1502
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:07,361
PHILLIP'S UP TO.

1503
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,029
HE'S QUIET.

1504
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,405
HE'S JUST HANGING OUT.

1505
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,073
HE'S NOT SCRAMBLING TOO MUCH.

1506
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:15,202
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UP HIS

1507
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:15,410
SLEEVE.

1508
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:18,288
>> I'VE ALREADY SPOKEN WITH ERIK

1509
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:18,830
JUST NOW.

1510
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:21,041
>> OH, YEAH, OKAY.

1511
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:22,084
HE'S TOTALLY FINE, RIGHT?

1512
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:25,253
>> HE SAID THERE'S NO DOUBT IN

1513
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:26,004
HIS MIND HE WANTS PHILLIP GONE

1514
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:29,383
FIRST BUT HE SAID PHILLIP CAME

1515
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,051
TO HIM AND SAID HE HAD NUMBERS,

1516
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:31,927
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

1517
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,387
>> REALLY?

1518
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:33,762
THEY HAVE NUMBERS.

1519
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:36,014
HOW ARE CORINNE AND PHILLIP

1520
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:36,348
NUMBERS?

1521
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:37,933
WHO ELSE WILL BE PART OF THAT

1522
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:38,225
ALLIANCE?

1523
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,851
>> I CAN ONLY GUESS MAYBE

1524
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:40,060
ANDREA.

1525
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:40,268
>> NO.

1526
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,938
>> I WOULD HOPE NOT BECAUSE WE

1527
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:43,730
ALREADY SPOKE WITH HER.

1528
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,440
>> WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON

1529
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:45,732
HERE?

1530
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,150
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW, THERE ARE

1531
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,902
STILL CONVERSATIONS GOING ON BUT

1532
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:49,403
IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR THAT

1533
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:50,779
PHILLIP IS GOING TO BE THE ONE

1534
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:51,071
TO GO.

1535
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:54,324
YOU KNOW, OF COURSE, I COULD BE

1536
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:54,616
BLINDSIDED.

1537
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,201
I COULD BE VOTED OUT FIRST,

1538
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:57,452
TWICE, WHICH WOULD BE THE WORST

1539
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:58,370
THING EVER.

1540
00:49:58,453 --> 00:49:59,496
REALLY THE WORKFORCE THING

1541
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:00,872
EVER-- I REALLY CAN'T TALK ABOUT

1542
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:04,918
THAT POSSIBILITY RIGHT NOW.

1543
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:06,253
>> I DON'T KNOW, DO YOU HAVE ANY

1544
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,463
PREFERENCE OR INCLINATIONS OR

1545
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:08,755
SOMETHING?

1546
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:09,673
>> WHAT ABOUT YOU?

1547
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:11,341
HOW ARE YOU THINKING YOU WANT TO

1548
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:11,550
PLAY?

1549
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:12,843
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY

1550
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:13,218
WITH ME.

1551
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:15,637
I JUST FEEL I DO TRUST YOU.

1552
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,347
I FEEL LIKE ONE GOOD PERSON TO

1553
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,433
TRUST IS GOING TO SAVE A LOT.

1554
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,059
>> COMING INTO THIS GAME I WAS A

1555
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,811
LITTLE BIT SKEPTICAL OF HOW DAWN

1556
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,062
WOULD REACT TO ME BECAUSE I

1557
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:26,565
ARGUABLY SCREWED HER OVER LAST

1558
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:26,857
TIME.

1559
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:27,232
I VOTED HER OUT.

1560
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:29,735
I WASN'T SURE IF THERE WAS

1561
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,278
ANYTHING TO BE ANY LINGERING

1562
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:31,611
RESENTMENT.

1563
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,823
I LIKE FRANCESCA.

1564
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:36,283
I WAS HOPING--

1565
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,577
>>Y DON'T TRUST FRANNIE FOR THE

1566
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,703
LONG HAUL BECAUSE SHE'S GOING TO

1567
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:41,455
PLAY TO WIN SO TO ME, SHE'S A

1568
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:42,122
PERSON, TAKE OUT.

1569
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,582
PHILLIP, MEDIUM.

1570
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,584
>> I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH HER.

1571
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:47,961
SHE'S HONEST TO A FAULT UNLESS

1572
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:48,545
SHE'S REINVENTED HERSELF OVER

1573
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:51,006
THE PAST YEAR AND DECIDED TO

1574
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:53,425
PLAY A MORE CUTTHROAT GAME.

1575
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:54,301
THE FACT THAT SHE IS WILLING TO

1576
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,219
TAKE OUT FRANNIE WHO SHE

1577
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:59,139
PROFESSED TO WORK WITH INDICATES

1578
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:02,601
THIS IS A NEW DAWN.

1579
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:03,810
MY CONVERSATION IS KIND OF WITH

1580
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,562
THE OTHER FACTION OF, LIKE,

1581
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,939
PHILLIP, ANDREA, YOU, ME,

1582
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:08,148
MALCOLM.

1583
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,025
>> I THINK THE TRUTH IS, IN THIS

1584
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:10,484
GAME, IT'S NUMBERS.

1585
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:11,276
>> IF IT'S ABOUT NUMBERS, THE

1586
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,235
OTHER NUMBERS AREN'T SECURE.

1587
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,862
>> I KNOW.

1588
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:15,155
>> AS FAR AS I CAN TELL.

1589
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,991
>> I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW-- I WANT

1590
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:19,159
TO WORK WITH YOU.

1591
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,161
I FEEL LIKE IT'S FAMILY FOR ME

1592
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,704
TO TRUST.

1593
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,664
YOU KNOW I'M GOOD THIS IS A

1594
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:24,831
GAME.

1595
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,166
COCHRAN AND I TALKED AT LENGTH

1596
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,292
ABOUT STAYING TOGETHER AND

1597
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,126
VOTING TOGETHER AND I TRUST HIM

1598
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,629
RIGHT NOW AND WHAT I'M GOG HAVE

1599
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:31,254
TO DO IS REALLY SEE WHAT'S IN

1600
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,548
THE BEST INTEREST FOR US AS FAR

1601
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:34,800
AS WHERE TO VOTE BECAUSE

1602
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,218
WHEREVER COCHRAN AND I LIE WE

1603
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:37,928
KIND OF SWING, AS FAR AS I CAN

1604
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:38,136
TELL.

1605
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:38,762
I MEAN, TO ME, IT'S PROBABLY THE

1606
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,097
TIME FOR US TO SAY, LET'S TAKE

1607
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,600
IT ALL THE WAY TO END AND LET'S

1608
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:44,976
FIGURE OUT WHO THE OTHER PEOPLE

1609
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:45,143
ARE.

1610
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,812
>> WE HAVE TO COME TO A DECISION

1611
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:47,813
RELATIVELY QUICKLY, THOUGH.

1612
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,981
>> I KNOW.

1613
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:50,607
WHEW.

1614
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,151
I WOULD LIKE USUL TO VOTE FOR

1615
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,402
PHILLIP, BUT JUST IN CASE, I

1616
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:56,321
DON'T KNOW IF WE NEED TO SPLIT

1617
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:57,155
THE VOTE BETWEEN HIM AND

1618
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:57,364
CORINNE.

1619
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:00,116
>> YOU'RE SAYING CORINNE NEXT.

1620
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,369
>> SHH.

1621
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,746
I'M THINKING, JUST BECAUSE I

1622
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,373
DON'T TRUST HER.

1623
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:07,541
MALCOLM IS NOT TALKING UNLESS

1624
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:08,250
HE'S TALKING TO ANY OF YOU GUYS.

1625
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:10,961
>> THAT WOULD BE MALCOLM.

1626
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:12,170
CORINNE, PHILLIP.

1627
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,129
THAT'S ALL WE NEED.

1628
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,631
>> BUT IF THEY HAVE AN IDOL,

1629
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:15,549
THEY ONLY NEED THREE.

1630
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:18,552
>> WHO DO YOU THINK IT IS WHY DO

1631
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:18,885
YOU THINK THAT?

1632
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:19,427
>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE

1633
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:22,055
CONSIDERING IS SPLITTING THE

1634
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:23,598
VOTES BECAUSE AS UNLIKELY AS IT

1635
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:24,850
MAY SEEM, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

1636
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,518
PHILLIP HAS AN IDOL, AND I HATE

1637
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,395
TO, LIKE, GO DOWN THIS PARANOID

1638
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,814
ROAD, BUT I DON'T KNOW.

1639
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:31,815
SOMETHING DOES NOT FEEL RIGHT

1640
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:37,320
ABOUT THE WAY THEY'RE BEHAVING.

1641
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,780
>> SO NOW WHAT?

1642
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,365
>> ANDREA KNOWS WE'RE SPLITTING

1643
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:40,615
THE VOTE.

1644
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,367
AND WHAT IF SHE TELLS .

1645
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:44,327
>> FRAN TRUSTS HER.

1646
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:44,786
>> WHO?

1647
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:45,537
>> ANDREA.

1648
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,496
I MEAN, THEY'RE CLOSE.

1649
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,581
>> THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING

1650
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:48,206
OUT HERE, DAWN.

1651
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,166
>> I THINK FOR SURE CORAND I

1652
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:50,876
KNOW ANDREA ARE TIGHT.

1653
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:53,461
>> YOU'RE SKEPTICAL, TOO, I'M

1654
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:53,753
GUESSING.

1655
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:53,962
>> YEAH.

1656
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:56,298
>> AND SO IS ERIK.

1657
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:58,508
>> DAWN YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME.

1658
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,343
I DON'T TRUST ANDREA AT ALL.

1659
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,511
SHE'LL BE TALKING TO ONE PERSON

1660
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:02,929
ONE SECOND, TALKING TO ANOTHER

1661
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:05,181
PERSON THE NEXT.

1662
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:06,224
STRATEGY, STRATEGY.

1663
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,560
SHE'S STRATEGIC, DUDE.

1664
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:08,852
SHE'S AWARE.

1665
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:10,437
I'M MORE INTIMIDATED BY ANDREA

1666
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,398
THAN ANYBODY ELSE OUT THERE.

1667
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:16,902
I THINK FRAN HAS THE FENCE ON

1668
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:17,110
ANDREA.

1669
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:19,195
I DON'T KNOW ANDREA WELL.

1670
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:19,821
IF SHE'S NERVOUS ABOUT IT, THEN

1671
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:20,280
DO IT.

1672
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:24,451
>> I JUST GOT A BAD VIBE FROM

1673
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:25,160
HER, TOO.

1674
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:26,453
>> THAT'S WHAT BRENDA SAID.

1675
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,330
>> NO, GOD NO.

1676
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:29,956
>> I NEED TO TALK TO HER.

1677
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:30,707
>> LET'S TALK.

1678
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:34,252
>> YOU TALK TO FRAN.

1679
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,671
>> BRANDON AND ME JUST GOT A

1680
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:37,714
REALLY WEIRD VIBE FROM ANDREA,

1681
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:39,883
AND WE THINK SHE'S PLAYING BOTH

1682
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:40,091
SIDES.

1683
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:42,802
AND THAT SHE'S TELLING EVERYBODY

1684
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,721
EVERYTHING AND SO WE JUST WANTED

1685
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:49,434
THE SWITCH THE FIVE OF YOU, YOU,

1686
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:51,227
BRENDA, AND DAWN AND NOT TELL

1687
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:51,478
ANYBODY.

1688
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,021
ANDREA AND COCK RAIN THINK WE'RE

1689
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:54,064
SPLITTING THE VOTE BECAUSE THEY

1690
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:54,648
COULD HAVE TOLD EVERYBODY THAT

1691
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,107
WE'RE SPLITTING THE VOTE.

1692
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,150
>> I TRUST COCHRAN.

1693
00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:59,152
>> YOU TRUST COCHRAN?

1694
00:53:59,235 --> 00:53:59,361
>> YEAH.

1695
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,737
>> DO YOU TRUST ANDREA?

1696
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:00,946
>> NO.

1697
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,073
>> I DON'T TRUST HER AT ALL,

1698
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:03,323
EITHER.

1699
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,199
>> NOT 100%.

1700
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:05,408
>> ERIK AND BRANDON SAID THEY

1701
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,661
WANTED TO VOTE FOR ANDREA.

1702
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:08,370
>> IT'S NOT ANYTHING AGAINST

1703
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:11,373
HER, IT'S JUST THAT SHE IS SO

1704
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,832
FREAKING SMART, DUDE.

1705
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,501
>> OKAY, THAT'S FINE.

1706
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:17,379
>> AND I'M JUST, LIKE, I MEAN,

1707
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:18,546
AT THIS POINT, WE'RE LEAVING FOR

1708
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,047
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1709
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:21,216
I HAVE NO TIME TO TRY TO GET TO

1710
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:22,217
THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

1711
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,010
IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO,

1712
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,387
THEN KNOW-- I MEAN, THE ONLY

1713
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:26,388
REASON THEY CAME UP WITH THAT

1714
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:27,889
PLAN IS BECAUSE I JUST DIDN'T

1715
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,891
WANT US TO GET TOTALLY SCREWED,

1716
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,601
AND NOW WE MIGHT-- THAT'S

1717
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:32,477
EXACTLY WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN.

1718
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,438
IF IT'S ME, I'M GOING TO BE

1719
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:35,689
PISSED.

1720
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,524
I'M GOING TO DROWN MYSELF IN THE

1721
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:37,691
OCEAN.

1722
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:41,528
>> OH, NO!

1723
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:45,031
>> YOU KNOW, IN A WAY I WANT TO

1724
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,200
VOTE OFF SOMEBODY LIKE

1725
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:47,450
FRANCESCA.

1726
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:48,827
THERE'S THIS KIND OF EMOTIONAL

1727
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:49,035
ASPECT.

1728
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,746
YOU CAN SAY YOU WANT TO PLAY THE

1729
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:52,372
MOST STRATEGIC, COLD-BLOOD GAME

1730
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,457
IN THE WORLD.

1731
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,252
BUT EMOTIONS DO ENTER INTO THE

1732
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:57,544
EQUATION.

1733
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:03,591
THERE IS A PART OF ME THAT LIKES

1734
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:03,758
HER.

1735
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:04,467
IT SEEMS IMHUMANE.

1736
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,302
I HAVE MORALS.

1737
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:06,886
I HAVE A SENSE OF SHAME.

1738
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:28,241
>> Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS

1739
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:29,325
A TORCH.

1740
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:31,327
GO AHEAD AND GRAB A TORCH,

1741
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:33,371
APPROACH A FLAME, DIP IT IN AND

1742
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,914
GET FIRE.

1743
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,416
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF

1744
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,543
TRIBAL COUNCIL, BECAUSE, AS YOU

1745
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:41,171
GUYS KNOW, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR

1746
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:41,379
LIFE.

1747
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:43,298
WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO ARE

1748
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:43,465
YOU.

1749
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:44,382
AND THAT IS GOING TO BE THE CASE

1750
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:47,177
FOR ONE OF YOU TONIGHT.

1751
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:47,761
BRANDON, IS SOMEBODY RUNNING

1752
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:50,430
THIS TRIBE OR WHEN YOU HAVE 10

1753
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:51,514
FAVORITES IS THERE REALLY NO

1754
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:51,723
BOSS?

1755
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:53,641
>> YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL KIND OF

1756
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:54,059
CHIEFS.

1757
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:54,559
THERE'S NO INDIANS HERE.

1758
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:57,604
EVERYBODY IS, LIKE, THEIR OWN

1759
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:57,812
PERSON.

1760
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:59,147
NOBODY IS IT GOING TO GET DONE

1761
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,191
LIKE THEY WERE DONE THE LAST

1762
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:01,399
TIME.

1763
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:04,194
>> Jeff: OH, SOMEBODY IS,

1764
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:04,444
TONIGHT.

1765
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:04,778
( LAUGHTER ).

1766
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,362
>> WELL, NOW THAT YOU PUT IT

1767
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,782
THAT WAY.

1768
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:09,699
...

1769
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,743
>> Jeff: SO, FRAN CHESK

1770
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:12,452
ATHERE'S A COUPLE OF YOU GUYS

1771
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,287
THAT PLAYED TOGETHER.

1772
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,914
AND YOU PHILLIP WERE FAMOUS

1773
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:18,083
BECAUSE OF YOUR RIVALRY BETWEEN

1774
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:18,458
EACH OTHER.

1775
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,627
AND THEN FOR THE WAY PHILLIP

1776
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:24,631
WOULD CALL YOU FRAN-CHESK-QWA.

1777
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,383
>> AND IT'S NEVER GOOD TO SEE

1778
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:30,678
SOMEONE YOU HAD AN INFAMOUS

1779
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:31,971
FIGHT WITH.

1780
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,681
IT'S GOOD THAT HE LEARNED HOW TO

1781
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:34,099
PRONOUNCE MY NAME.

1782
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:36,768
>> FRANCESCA, FRANCESCA, FRAN

1783
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:37,102
COMESKA.

1784
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,019
YOU'RE WELCOME.

1785
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,562
>> Jeff: DID YOU WORK ON

1786
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:40,980
SAYING THER NAME?

1787
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,233
>> NO, ACTUALLY, I COULD IN FACT

1788
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:43,817
SAY HER NAME BEFORE BUT DURING

1789
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:44,651
THE COURSE OF THAT TRIBAL

1790
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,402
COUNCIL, THERE WERE CERTAIN

1791
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:46,945
THINGS THAT WERE SAID, AND

1792
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:49,948
RATHER THAN USE AN EXPLIKATIVE,

1793
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:55,954
I DECIDED TO SAY FLAN-CHES-KWA.

1794
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:56,579
>> Jeff: PHILLIP, HOW WAS IT

1795
00:56:56,663 --> 00:57:00,500
FOR YOU TO SEE FRANCESCA?

1796
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,627
>> SOMEWHAT APPREHENSIVE.

1797
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:03,503
SOME OF THE SAME THINGS THAT

1798
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:06,381
OCCURRED IN OUR SEASON, SHE WAS

1799
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:07,799
VERY STRATEGIC EARLY ON IN THE

1800
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:09,342
GAME WHEN SHE DIDN'T NECESSARILY

1801
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:10,510
NEED TO BE SO I WAS CONCERNED

1802
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:11,594
ABOUT THAT.

1803
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:15,640
>> Jeff: FRANCESCA, PHILLIP'S

1804
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:17,809
COMMENT BRINGS UP AN INTERESTING

1805
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:18,768
POINT FOR YOU.

1806
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:21,104
YOU ARE BACK FOR A SECOND

1807
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:21,354
SEASON.

1808
00:57:21,437 --> 00:57:22,730
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH

1809
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:23,022
EXPERIENCE.

1810
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,899
YOU WERE THE FIRST PERSON VOTED

1811
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:25,066
OFF.

1812
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,026
>> YOU KEEP BRINGING THAT UP,

1813
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:27,193
JEFF.

1814
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,279
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE SAYING I'M BAD

1815
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,030
AT "SURVIVOR."

1816
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,992
>> Jeff: NO, I YOU SAID THAT.

1817
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:34,409
>> THAT GUY IS GOOD.

1818
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:35,952
>> Jeff: ALL I SAID ITS YOU

1819
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,620
DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH EXPERIENCE.

1820
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:38,496
>> ON THE ONE HAND YOU CAN LOOK

1821
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,498
AT IT THAT WAY.

1822
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:42,709
BUT EVERYBODY HERE IS SO SMART

1823
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:43,501
AND KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING

1824
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,378
NOBODY FEELS SUPER SECURE.

1825
00:57:45,461 --> 00:57:46,713
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING TO

1826
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:47,463
HAPPEN TONIGHT.

1827
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:47,881
PLANS WERE CHANGING.

1828
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,549
PEOPLE WERE GETTING PARANOID.

1829
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:51,676
I MEAN, I GOT PARANOID.

1830
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:54,345
AND WHAT'S THE PARANOIA STARTS

1831
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,638
IT'S DEFINITELY LIKE A SNOWBALL

1832
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:55,889
EFFECT.

1833
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:58,850
>> I WANTED TO ADD, JEFF, SOME

1834
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,476
SOMETIMES PARANOIA START WHEN

1835
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,644
YOU HEAR THAT SOME PEOPLE

1836
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,354
SUGGEST IT'S YOU.

1837
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:03,897
>> Jeff: HAVE YOU HEARD YOUR

1838
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,024
NAME TOSSED AROUND JAI HEARD MY

1839
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:07,192
NAME TOSSED AROUND.

1840
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:07,859
>> Jeff: ALREADY?

1841
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:08,818
>> ALREADY.

1842
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,153
>> WE WERE ALL PARANOID.

1843
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,446
>> I THINK EVERYONE HERE.

1844
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:12,947
YOU HEAR ONE LITTLE COMMENT, AND

1845
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,157
YOU CAN JUST FREAK OUT.

1846
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,867
IF YOU TELL THE WRONG THING TO

1847
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,535
THE WRONG PERSON AND ALL OF A

1848
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:19,245
SUDDEN IT GETS BACK TO YOU, AND

1849
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:22,540
THEN MAYBE YOU WILL GO OUT.

1850
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:25,084
>> Jeff: ANDREA, WHAT DO YOU

1851
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,795
THINK THE SAKE IT ON YOU FROM

1852
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:28,504
THE OTHER NINE.

1853
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,256
>> I THINK THEY SEE I BRING IT

1854
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:30,840
TO CHALLENGES AND I DO WORK

1855
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,967
AROUND CAMP BUT I'M NOT GOING TO

1856
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:33,593
FEEL COMFORTABLE IN THIS GAME AT

1857
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:34,719
ALL.

1858
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:35,720
MY MISTAKE LAST TIME I PLAYED

1859
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:37,180
WAS I GOT COMFORTABLE.

1860
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:38,264
AND EVEN SOMETIMES WORKING

1861
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,557
DISMARD BEING STRATEGIC OR

1862
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:40,934
WORKING AROUND CAMP IT DOESN'T

1863
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,060
REALLY MEAN ANYTHING.

1864
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,478
>> Jeff: COCHRAN, ONE OF THE

1865
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:45,271
THINGS ABOUT PLAYING WITH

1866
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,773
EXPERIENCED PLAYERS, GAME IS SO

1867
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,316
MUCH FASTER.

1868
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:49,984
THINGS CAN HAPPEN AT TRIBAL

1869
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:50,235
COUNCIL.

1870
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:51,527
YOU CAN HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE,

1871
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:54,113
AND SUDDENLY, HEAR SOMEBODY SAY

1872
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,324
SOMETHING AND GO, "AH, WE GOTTA

1873
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:57,200
CHANGE THINGS UP.

1874
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:57,367
OF.

1875
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:57,700
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1876
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:58,701
WE'VE SEEN THAT HAPPEN BEFORE.

1877
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,621
WE SAW BOSTON ROB REACH OUT HIS

1878
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,539
HAND AND TOUCH THE SHOULDER OF

1879
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,250
THE PERSON HE WANTED VOTED OFF.

1880
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:05,792
THERE'S PRECEDENT FOR THIS.

1881
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,961
ESPECIALLY ANY A GROUP OF

1882
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,963
RETURNING PLAYERS, THERE ARE

1883
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,339
CIRCLES WITHIN CIRCEPS AND

1884
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:12,715
STRATEGIES AND BACKUP PLANS AND

1885
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:15,343
THAT'S THE EXCITEMENT OF

1886
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:16,386
RETURNING PLAYERS.

1887
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:16,970
WE'RE NOT SPENDING THE FIRST

1888
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:18,930
THREE DAYS, OH, MY GOD.

1889
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:21,224
I HAVE TO GO TO A BATHROOM AND I

1890
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:23,476
HAVE TO OPEN A COCONUT.

1891
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:25,270
WHAT IS GOING ON?

1892
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:25,812
IT'S EXCITING.

1893
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,605
>> Jeff: WELL, SOMEBODY IS

1894
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,023
ABOUT TO BE THE FIRST PERSON

1895
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:32,235
VOTED OUT OF "FANS VERSUS

1896
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:32,527
FAVORITES."

1897
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:33,611
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1898
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:40,910
BRANDON, YOU'RE UP.

1899
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:48,459
>> THIS IS A VOTE OUT OF

1900
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:49,002
PARANOIA, BUT JUST BECAUSE

1901
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:51,504
YOU'RE PARANOID DOESN'T MEAN

1902
00:59:51,587 --> 01:00:07,937
SOMEONE ISN'T OUT TO GET YOU.

1903
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,941
>> YOU'RE GOING TO BE SO UPSET

1904
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,943
WITH ME.

1905
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,695
BUT YOU'RE GETTING VOTED OUT

1906
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:17,030

1907
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:20,867

1910
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:46,309
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:46,893
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY TNOW

1912
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:53,483
