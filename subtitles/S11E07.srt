<i>Survivor:</i> Margaret's negativity

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,963
was weighing on Nakum.

4
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:07,882
>> She just can't grasp the fact

5
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:08,508
that the old tribe ain't coming

6
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:09,759
back.

7

>> PROBST: At the challenge,

8
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:11,177
tribes learned they would

9
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,262
compete for hamburgers and beer.

10
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,389
>> Yes!

11
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:15,432
>> PROBST: But they also learned

12
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,016
that things were shaking up.

13
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,643
Tonight, both tribes are

14
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,019
going to Tribal Council, both

15
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,730
tribes are voting somebody out.

16
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:23,481
In addition, to the barbecue

feast, the winning tribe earns

18
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:25,483
the right to compete in another

Survivors, ready... go!

22
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,491
The challenge was grueling, and

23
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,034
the tribes were pushed to their

24
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,494
limits.

25
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,203
Amy was down with a serious

ankle injury.

27
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:40,331
Amy is hurt.

28
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:43,084
And tempers flared when Jamie

29
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,378
and Bobby Jon squared off.

30
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,298
(<i> both yelling</i> )

31
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,466
In the end, Nakum claimed the

00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,050
award.

33
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:51,468
And they have it!

Nakum wins barbecue feast and a

38
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,893
Rafe won the challenge.

39
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:00,602
>> Got it.

40
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:01,770
>> PROBST: Rafe wins immunity.

41
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:02,353
And was the only person to be

42
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,314
safe for one more night.

43
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,106
>> Great stuff!

00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,650
>> PROBST: At Yaxha, Brian tried

45
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,360
to rally Amy and Gary to oust

46
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:13,990
Bobby Jon.

47
00:01:14,073 --> 00:01:15,700
>> PROBST: But both he and Amy

48
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,202
were also at risk.

49

>> Amy and Brian are probably in

50
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,621
the biggest threat of getting

51
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:21,498
voted off.

52
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,041
You know, they are probably the

53
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,501
physically weaker players.

54

>> It doesn't get better than

59
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:30,340
this.

60
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,299

himself into trouble.

63
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,761
that beer?

64
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,012
>> There's only two beers left.

65
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:36,930
>> I definitely got one coming,

66
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:37,847
without a doubt.

mouth.

69
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,183
He gets so pumped up, and his

70
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,936
mouth works before his brain

71
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,854
does.

when he attacked Margaret.

75
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,486
>> Did you or did you not-- as

76
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,320
soon as you saw me, did you tell

77
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,614
me that I had A.D.D.

78
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:55,198
>> This is what it is like to

79
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,199
try to talk to him.

80
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,242
>> You should just shut up.

81
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,285
>> PROBST: Judd got his way and

82
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,912
Margaret was voted out of the

83
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:01,871
tribe.

00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,625
Margaret, the tribe has spoken.

85
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,043
Rafe sat in on Yaxha's Tribal

Listen, I want to thank you guys

98
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,136
too, for, you know, my bark

99
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:41,387
ain't as big as my bite, man.

100
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,556
And that's damn true, man, you

101
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,641
know.

102
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,934

voted out; thank God, man.

105
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,021
She just pushed my button, man.

106
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,481
And she pushed it, and pushed it

107
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,941
and pushed it, and pushed it,

108
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:53,775
and kept pushing it.

109
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:54,859
I couldn't take it anymore.

110
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:55,485
So I kind of had a little

111
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,612
outburst and put her in her

112
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,571
place, man.

113
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,156
See, in the other tribe she was

114
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,741
the mom over there.

115
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,076
Everybody used to run around and

116
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,035
call her mom.

117
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:04,661
When she didn't have that role

118
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,328
any more, man, that just

119
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,329
devastated her.

120
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,414
>> I'm just glad this is all

121
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:08,665
over with.

camp, I never do that, man.

125
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,336
I'm happy all day.

126
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,838
I'm just a big teddy bear, man,

127
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:16,673
you know.

128
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,633
Hopefully, I'll be laughing my

129
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,051
ass to the bank, and she'll

130
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,469
still be at home, making chicken

131
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,303
wings or something.

132
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,555
Somebody is going to badmouth

133
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,015
me, man-- listen, I'm not gonna

134
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,475
to sit there like a little wuss

135
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,351
and take it.

136
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:28,685
I don't care.

137
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,895
I ain't going to get up and hit

138
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:31,604
you either, though.

139

>> The thing is with Judd, he

140
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,523
has a big voice, you know, he's

141
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,400
a big guy.

142
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,110
So that scares a lot of people,

143
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,778
but it doesn't make me nervous.

144
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:39,445
If anything, it makes me want to

145
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,447
keep Judd closer, because I

146
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,534
could take him to final, and

147
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,410
then I would have all the votes

148
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,328
and Judd wouldn't have any

149
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,621
because he is going to keep

150
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,374
blowing up.

151
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,642

00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,527

159
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:37,712
part of the game.

160
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:38,921
Everybody over here at Yaxha has

161
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:39,464
these things all over them.

162
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,841
Um, I just got a couple of bad

163
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:42,967
ones, and I got one on my right

164
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:43,509
shoulder right now.

165
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,511
It is pretty bad.

166
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,971
I went to take my shirt off this

167
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:47,889
morning, and it was literally

168
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,432
pasted to it.

169
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,433
Got a long way to go in the

170
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,476
game, so I will probably get a

171
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,727
lot more banged up than this.

172
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,936
So, just right now you just be

173
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,520
tough and know that there is a

174
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,773

177
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,403
I don't look like that, right?

00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,365
They look like that one right

00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,507
and it sucks.

193
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,842
I go into these challenges and

194
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:25,927
you completely forget about

195
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,136
this.

196
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,222
I probably won't even feel it.

197
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,106
>> PROBST: Come on in, Nakum!

198
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,734
Yaxha, come on in!

199
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,695
Both tribes getting their first

200
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:45,571
look at the new tribes after the

201
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,615
last Tribal Council.

202
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,575
Margaret voted out of Nakum.

203
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,703
Brian voted out at Yaxha.

204
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,997
You guys ready to get to today's

205
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,040
challenge?

206
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:56,707
>> Yeah.

207
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:56,958
>> Yes.

208
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,417
>> PROBST: Today's challenge

209
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,710
will require team work and a lot

210
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,337
of dexterity.

211
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:01,963
Four tribe members are going to

212
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,340
wrap 30 feet of material around

213
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:05,800
their bodies, and then unspool

214
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,802
that material as they make their

215
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,387
way down field to the finish.

216
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,388
Here is how it works:

217
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,265
First person will move around a

218
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,308
pole as quickly as they can,

219
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,852
unspooling the material off of

220
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,603
the pole and onto their body.

221
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,480
You'll then move to the second

222
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,439
person.

223
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,274
You'll connect to the second

224
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,233
person, then together the two of

225
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:22,859
you will move around the pole,

226
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,194
putting the material around both

227
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,154
of your bodies.

228
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,155
Then the third person, finally

229
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:27,613
the fourth person.

230
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,490
So you will end up with four

231
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,075
people wrapping material around

232
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,410
the group.

233
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,035
Once you have all the material

234
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,745
around all four people, you

235
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,497
start moving down field and

236
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,666
begin unwinding the material off

237
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,293
of your body.

238
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,961
Each time a person unwinds, they

239
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,254
unclip, and head to the finish

240
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,338
mat.

241
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,590
There is one other person in

242
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:46,757
this challenge.

243
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,009
They are the winder.

244
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,594
Their job is to assist the other

245
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:50,636
four anyway they can by helping

246
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,097
them move around the pole or

247
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:53,723
helping them keep their balance.

248
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,058
First tribe to get all five

249
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,768
tribe members to the finish mat

250
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:58,936
wins a reward.

251
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,354
Want to know what are you

252
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:00,646
playing for?

253
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,148
>> Yes, sir.

254
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:02,732
>> Yes.

255
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,816
>> PROBST: Well, the Maya are

256
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,984
credited with a few things.

257
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:05,568
Relationship with the stars,

258
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,653
accounting system, Mayan

259
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,779
calendar, but there is one big

260
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,448
discovery you might not be

261
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,075
familiar with: the Maya

262
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,161
discovered chocolate.

263
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,413
Most would agree it might be

264
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:19,040
their biggest discovery.

265
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,333
Today you are playing for

266
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,293
chocolate.

267
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,461
>> Oh, my God.

268
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,045
>> PROBST: Also, the winning

269
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,088
tribe will get a chance to take

270
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,758
part in a zip-line canopy tour

271
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,551
of the jungles of Guatemala.

272
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,762
You will literally glide over

273
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,222
these jungles.

274
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,389
When you're finished, chocolate

275
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:35,765
feast awaits you.

276
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:36,641
Worth playing for?

277
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:37,725
>> Yes.

278
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,560
>> PROBST: Nakum you have one

279
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:39,894
extra member.

280
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:40,645
You're sitting somebody out?

281
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,438
>> Judd.

282
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:43,314
>> PROBST: Judd's going to sit

283
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:43,981
this one out.

284
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,066
Give you a minute to figure out

285
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,359
who is going to be the winder

286
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,693
and who are going to be the four

287
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:48,653
"wind-ees."

288
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,779
Then we'll get started.

289
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,280
All right, everybody is at a

290
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,531
pole, clipped in, ready to go.

291
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,908
Amy is the winder for Yaxha;

292
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,911
Jamie, the winder for Nakum.

293
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,664
Here we go, for a reward.

294
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,791
Survivors ready.

295
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,834
Go!

296
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,630
Got to tag before you can start

297
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,631
winding.

298
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,590
Jamie's there first.

299
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,259
There's Amy, on the bad ankle.

300
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,677
>> Wait, wait, wait.

301
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,803
>> PROBST: You're wrapping the

302
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,054
material around your body.

303
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,264
>> Come on, Steph.

304
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,807
Come on.

305
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,809
>> Keep spinning, baby.

306
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,810
>> Come on, Brandon.

307
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,395
Come on, come on.

308
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,646
>> PROBST: Steph unclips.

309
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,648
Clipping in to Lydia.

310
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,732
Now the two of them have to wrap

311
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,401
the material around both bodies.

312
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,861
Brandon and Amy now back in it.

313
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,864
Brandon clips in to Gary.

314
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,741
The two of them now have to move

315
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:36,993
that material around both of

316
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,077
their bodies.

317
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,203
>> Back it up.

318
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,538
>> Steph and Lydia having a lot

319
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,956
of trouble at their second pole.

320
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,459
Get together, hug.

321
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,669
Now you got it going.

322
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,587
>> Come on, let's go.

323
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:49,630
Let's go.

324
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,881
>> PROBST: Gary and Brandon with

325
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,091
a lead for Yaxha now, working

326
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,134
together well.

327
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,218
>> You got the lead, just don't

328
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,344
mess up.

329
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,387
>> PROBST: Steph and Lydia have

330
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,638
a lot of time to make up.

331
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,932
Gary and Brandon moving up to

332
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,183
Bobby Jon.

333
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,727
>> Take your time.

334
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,894
>> PROBST: Gary, Brandon, Bobby

335
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,479
Jon got a decent lead.

336
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,023
Big reward at stake.

337
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,399
Nakum making up some time.

338
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,694
Both tribes at the third pole.

339
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,821
>> Spin, Bobby Jon.

340
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,364
No, spin your body.

341
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,324
>> PROBST: Yaxha seems to be

342
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,908
slowing down.

343
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,160
Nakum making up a lot of ground.

344
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,161
>> Keep going, keep going.

345
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,871
>> Stop right here, right here.

346
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,582
>> PROBST: Bobby Jon, Gary,

347
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,207
Brandon, unclip and move to the

348
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,667
fourth pole.

349
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,794
Danni clips in.

350
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,171
Yaxha must now wrap the material

351
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:30,755
around all four tribe members.

352
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,591
Nakum, you're still in it.

353
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,425
Keep moving, let's go.

354
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,885
>> Move those feet, Lydia.

355
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,303
Keep it going.

356
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,554
You guys can do it.

357
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:39,388
We're still in it.

358
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,431
>> Got it.

359
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:41,265
>> PROBST: Nakum heading to the

360
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,641
fourth pole.

361
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,642
>> Go to your right, Brandon.

362
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,560
There we go.

363
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,561
>> Keep going, you got it, you

364
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:46,771
got it, you got it.

365
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,730
>> PROBST: It's getting tougher

366
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,856
to move with four people.

367
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:49,732
>> Keep your hands up.

368
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,733
>> PROBST: Keep your hands up.

369
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,485
That's it, Nakum; that's

370
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:52,818
working.

371
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,612
We're at the fourth pole, and we

372
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:55,946
are dead even.

373
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,114
Nakum has made up some time.

374
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:57,990
>> We got it, we got it.

375
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:58,699
We're beating them.

376
00:10:58,783 --> 00:10:59,533
We got it.

377
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,493
>> Here we go, here we go.

378
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,369
>> PROBST: Nakum is good.

379
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,411
Jamie, you're done.

380
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,914
Nakum is unwinding.

381
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,124
>> One more round.

382
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,626
Come on!

383
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:09,460
>> PROBST: Jamie's first to hit

384
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,294
the mat.

385
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,962
(<i> all shouting</i> )

386
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:12,380
Amy, you're done.

387
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,590
Yaxha is unwinding.

388
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,008
Working hard, making up a lot of

389
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:16,967
ground.

390
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,136
Nakum seems to be slowing down.

391
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,721
Now Yaxha is back in the lead.

392
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,349
>> Come on Yaxha.

393
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,475
>> PROBST: Nakum, don't panic;

394
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,851
patience is key.

395
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,062
Danni's out of it, heads to the

396
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,063
finish.

397
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,731
Cindy is out of it.

398
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,192
Nakum takes a tumble.

399
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,278
Bobby Jon is out.

400
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,738
Nakum panicking, cannot get up.

401
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:38,906
>> Come on!

402
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,908
>> PROBST: Gary and Brandon with

403
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:41,742
a big lead for Yaxha now.

404
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,911
Nakum really falling behind.

405
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,247
Gary unclipped.

406
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,832
Rafe right behind,

407
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:48,958
not giving up.

408
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,626
Brandon is the last one!

409
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:53,921
>> Come on!

410
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,464
Yeah!

411
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,842
>> PROBST: Yaxha wins reward!

412
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,885
(<i> cheering</i> )

413
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,726
Yaxha, good work.

414
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,144
You remained calm.

415
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:08,894
Big reward.

416
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,022
Chocolate, zip-line canopy tour.

417
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,566
You are leaving from here, going

418
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,067
to that right now.

419
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,112
Nakum, flip side: you fell down;

420
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,405
you couldn't get up; you guys

421
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,281
panicked.

422
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,740
I got nothing for you.

423
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:22,908
Head on back to camp.

424
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,427
>> This is crazy.

425
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,678
>> I'm afraid of heights.

426
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:43,804
>> We won a reward challenge

427
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:44,013
today.

428
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,014
We really needed some momentum

429
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,433
on our side, and we got it.

430
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,976
Just to get out of camp and come

431
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,269
and do something new is just

432
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,313
amazing.

433
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,941
>> I'm petrified right now.

434
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:56,901
The zip line-- you have this

435
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,570
harness thing on.

436
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,655
You buckle into this big cable.

437
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:02,156
Jump.

438
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:02,823
And you're up high, which, of

439
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,033
course, I'm afraid of heights.

440
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,826
What happens if I get stuck in

441
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,785
the middle?

442
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:07,661
>> You won't.

443
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:08,871
>> I won't?

444
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,164
>> No.

445
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,123
>> You're just hanging there,

446
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,625
and you just have all your

447
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,792
confidence in the cable line.

448
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,794
It's a little frightening.

449
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,046
>> I'm going alone, right?

450
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:21,008
>> You got it.

451
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,886
(<i> crying</i> )

452
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,012
You're good.

453
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,805
>> Oh, my God.

454
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:27,932
I can't believe this.

455
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:28,891
>> There you go.

456
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,268
Yeah.

457
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,562
Woo!

458
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,857
Woo!

459
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,945
(<i> monkey howling</i> )

460
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,531
Oh, my God!

461
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,450
>> Way to go, Amy!

462
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,785
>> Oh, my gosh.

463
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,079
>> Freakin' get me there!

464
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,748
>> Whoo!

465
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:53,832
>> Good job, Amy.

466
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:54,542
>> Yeah!

467
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,709
>> Oh, my God, are we done?

468
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,336
An unbelievable experience.

469
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,754
But probably, for me, just a

470
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:01,340
once-in-a-lifetime experience.

471
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:05,302
>> Yeah, Bobby Jon.

472
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,096
>> We got to swing through the

473
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:07,888
jungle on these cables, and it

474
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:12,101
felt just, just majestic...

475
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,062
Going through the jungle, the

476
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,273
wind hitting your face and just

477
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,607
looking at all these tall plants

478
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,984
and trees and stuff.

479
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:23,153
Woo!

480
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,488
That stuff I see in the movies,

481
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,447
you know?

482
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,532
I've never done anything like

483
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:27,533
that in my entire life before.

484
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,618
I'll probably never do it again.

485
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,960
>> Oh, man, this is going to be

486
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,086
cool.

487
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:43,716
>> Woo!

488
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,968
Woo!

489
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,094
>> Oh, man!

490
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,637
>> Man, I had no idea that you

491
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,555
could even do that.

492
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,639
Just flying through the air

493
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,348
and...

494
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,392
God, it was so cool.

495
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,399
My God!

496
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,192
Holy cow, man!

497
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,110
(<i> laughter</i> )

498
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:06,196
Look at all that stuff.

499
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,990
Oh, my God.

500
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,576
At the end of the zip line was

501
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,702
the most chocolate I've ever

502
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:12,828
seen in my life.

503
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:13,454
I mean, it was a chocolate-fest.

504
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,123
Cake, pralines, cookies,

505
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,292
strawberries-- I mean, you name

506
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,627
it, it was there.

507
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,253
Cheers on a good win today.

508
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,379
>> Yes, absolutely.

509
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,172
Great win.

510
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:23,922
>> Momentum.

511
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,132
>> Oh, my God, cherries!

512
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:29,386
>> Holy cow, man.

513
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,014
That's a good piece of cake.

514
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,098
>> So much chocolate.

515
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,225
>> Man, I pigged out.

516
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,144
I mean, I have never pigged

517
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,187
out on chocolate that much,

518
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,104
ever.

519
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,065
Just looking at the muddy

520
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,274
ground-- 'cause it looks, you

521
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,525
know, like chocolate almost a

522
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,902
little bit-- makes me a little

523
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:45,986
bit sick.

524
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,946
So do we want to try and take

525
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,198
all this or just?

526
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,532
>> Take the whole thing.

527
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,617
>> Yeah.

528
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,535
>> I'm going to remember today

529
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,036
for two reasons.

530
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,205
The day I went rip-cording

531
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,581
through a jungle, and the day

532
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,083
that I ate the most chocolate

533
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,502
I have ever eaten in my entire

534
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,837
life.

535
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,297
>> God, I hope I hold that down.

536
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,935
>> What do you guys want to

537
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,228
play?

538
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,229
>> We'll play UNO.

539
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,522
>> I always try to do like

540
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:22,648
different things around camp

541
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:23,232
that will help us have fun and

542
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,109
pass time.

543
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,151
King is reverse.

544
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,277
Queen is skip.

545
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,320
We picked all these little

546
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,613
leaves from the tree and then

547
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,865
painted four different suits and

548
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,409
all the cards, so it made a deck

549
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,159
of 52 cards, with even two

550
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,120
jokers.

551
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,454
>> The stems are the bottom of

552
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,414
the cards, Amy.

553
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,165
>> Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

554
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,097
>> Today happens to be my

555
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,348
birthday, so we thought we'd go

556
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,808
over and invite Nakum over for a

557
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,852
little pool party.

558
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,444
>> Skip me?

559
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,279
>> No, it skipped you and me.

560
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,281
>> Skip to me.

561
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:16,118
>> Nakum!

562
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,411
Nakum!

563
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,412
>> Guys, I think the other tribe

564
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,413
is coming to visit.

565
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,456
>> I think the other tribe is

566
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,582
here.

567
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,583
>> They yelled it twice.

568
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,584
>> I heard "Nakum."

569
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,918
You guys going down there?

570
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,003
>> Yeah, let's go.

571
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,171
>> Nakum!

572
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:27,546
>> That is them.

573
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,006
That's them.

574
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:29,923
>> Probably out there on the

575
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:30,632
boat.

576
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,467
>> Why are they coming here?

577
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,301
There is nothing to do here.

578
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,260
>> I don't know, maybe they came

579
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,303
to invite us to their pool.

580
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,387
>> I ain't going to their pool.

581
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,472
>> These are our enemies at this

582
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,431
point.

583
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,307
>> Yeah, but this has never

584
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:38,599
happened.

585
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,183
>> We were like, should we go?

586
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,851
I was like, yeah, let's walk

587
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:41,477
down.

588
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,478
And then Jamie started saying,

589
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,687
I think it's a bad idea.

590
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,313
I don't think we should do this.

591
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,148
I was like, guys, what's the

592
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,441
worst thing that is going to

593
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,485
happen?

594
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,990
>> Oh, there they are.

595
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:56,033
>> Yo!

596
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,076
>> Judd the stud.

597
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:57,284
>> Hi!

598
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,203
It's my birthday, so we figured

599
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,579
we would invite you all over for

600
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:01,705
a pool party.

601
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,915
>> Oh, what are you guys up to,

602
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:03,957
man?

603
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:04,708
>> What's going on?

604
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,375
>> We just wanted to come show

605
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,419
some love.

606
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,428
>> We have a few little bitty

607
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,554
birthday treats.

608
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,347
>> I'll go.

609
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,807
>> All right, let's get on.

610
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,766
>> Come on, let's go.

611
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:21,350
Let's get our boat.

612
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,309
Man, let's have a party.

613
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,310
Danni's birthday today, man.

614
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,270
>> We really just wanted to have

615
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:25,521
a party.

616
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,188
I mean, we have been here 17

617
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,315
days now, and I'm always big on

618
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,316
birthday parties, so we had to

619
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,610
do something.

620
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,119
>> I don't like these people, so

621
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,120
I don't understand why we're

622
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:42,996
going over to hang out.

623
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,872
>> I'm with you, man.

624
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,916
>> I'm right there with you.

625
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:49,795
>> I didn't want to go.

626
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:50,712
I thought it was stupid.

627
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,588
It's a long way.

628
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,256
It's hot, and I just found it

629
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,298
unnecessary.

630
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,467
Why should we go and hang out

631
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,885
with the people that we want to

632
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,095
get rid of?

633
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,555
But, you know, I have to show an

634
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,889
interest in what the tribe wants

635
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,975
to do, so I went.

636
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,268
>> Amy, hey, how you doing?

637
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,978
>> This is nice.

638
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:06,395
>> What's up, guys?

639
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,647
>> That's nice.

640
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,524
>> How you doing?

641
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:11,608
>> What's up, man?

642
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,776
>> You guys should sleep out

643
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,610
there.

644
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,778
>> We thought about it.

645
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:15,779
>> We've got some chocolate.

646
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,239
>> Oh, my gosh.

647
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,282
>> How do you have extra

648
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,533
chocolate?

649
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,576
>> Are you serious?

650
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,827
>> Thank you.

651
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,202
Oh, my...

652
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,245
>> Happy birthday.

653
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,872
Thank you.

654
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,081
>> How old are you?

655
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:27,666
>> This is all for us?

656
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,418
>> Oh, thank you guys so much.

657
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,420
>> Oh, my God, the chocolate.

658
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,212
Like, that was the main reason I

659
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,881
was coming.

660
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:34,923
They said they had chocolate

661
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:35,716
for us.

662
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,925
I was like, hell, yeah, I will

663
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,051
go in your pool, and I'll eat

664
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:38,969
your chocolate.

665
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,053
It was unreal.

666
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:40,429
>> Unbelievable.

667
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:44,725
>> That is so good.

668
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,938
>> Aah! Man!

669
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,317
>> Thank you for the invitation.

670
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,697
>> Absolutely.

671
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,157
>> Today is just about a

672
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,949
fellowship.

673
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,075
We're coming together.

674
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,702
I mean, the chief of the tribes

675
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:04,745
in ancient Mayan times would go

676
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,371
and communicate with each other.

677
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,331
They would sit and they would

678
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,750
smoke, and they would be at war

679
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,335
later on.

680
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,377
>> This is like heaven.

681
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,462
I would just sit here all day.

682
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,796
>> We're not getting out until

683
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,422
we leave, man.

684
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,174
>> Woo!

685
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,258
This is paradise.

686
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:18,800
>> How old is your oldest

687
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,551
brother?

688
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,636
Mine is 39.

689
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,637
>> I was being quiet.

690
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,763
I was figuring everybody out,

691
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,056
whether Amy and Gary were with

692
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,349
them, or were they waiting for a

693
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,850
merge to try and get back with

694
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:27,976
us.

695
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,186
I was worried that maybe

696
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:29,811
Stephanie was getting along too

697
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,230
well with other people.

698
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:31,855
Maybe she would, you know, form

699
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,315
bonds there.

700
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,733
I'm here for business, and

701
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:35,817
everyone else should be also.

702
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,861
>> We can go now.

703
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,115
>> Thanks for having us.

704
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,283
>> Thank you so much for the

705
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,409
chocolate, you guys.

706
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,535
>> Thank you for inviting us.

707
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,828
>> Bye, guys.

708
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:47,788
>> Thank you so much.

709
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:48,413
Jamie is like, hey guys, are you

710
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,373
guys ready? Out of nowhere.

711
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,416
He's like, I think we should

712
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,626
leave soon, and he's like, no, I

713
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:53,293
kind of want to go now.

714
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:56,713
>> You are so shady.

715
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:57,798
>> You are like the shadiest

716
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,049
person.

717
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,175
>> My being quiet?

718
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:00,384
>> Yeah.

719
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,510
>> Well, I don't care.

720
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,387
I'll like those people after

721
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,721
this game is over, you know.

722
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,765
I think we stayed too long,

723
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,517
because it's getting way too

724
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,519
friendly over here.

725
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,812
It's kind of making me sick,

726
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:12,980
they were all getting along

727
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,147
so well.

728
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:14,690
>> I'm still sticking to the

729
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,233
game plan we got, though.

730
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:16,692
>> Well, we have to.

731
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,318
>> No, I'm not going to stick to

732
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:18,944
the game plan because we went to

733
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,237
a pool party.

734
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:20,862
>> Hey, y'all can vote my ass

735
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,531
out if you all want to.

736
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,907
>> Jamie, what is wrong with

737
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:24,574
you?

738
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,826
>> You said I was being shady.

739
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,077
>> You are, I think you are

740
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,577
losing it in Guatemala.

741
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,288
>> Jamie sometimes, like, freaks

742
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:29,871
me out.

743
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:30,831
I just don't understand where

744
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:31,915
the kid's head is at sometimes.

745
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:32,874
I'm not going to back down to

746
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:33,875
somebody like him.

747
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,918
So there could be a clashblac

748
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:35,502
between he and I, because I,

749
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:38,964
can't take it.

750
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,197
>> These things are eating this

751
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:07,701
stuff.

752
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,620
I almost caught one in my mouth.

753
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,459
>> I think we're going to win

754
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,543
immunity because we have good

755
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,420
momentum.

756
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,047
And you know what, when we win

757
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,214
immunity, we could have options.

758
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:21,840
If we don't win immunity, we're

759
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,717
going to have to be for

760
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,843
ourselves, right?

761
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:25,969
>> It's you or me.

762
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,262
Those three are tight.

763
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,472
>> Right now, there's five of us

764
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,057
in the Yaxha tribe.

765
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,600
Three original Nakum members,

766
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,517
and then Amy and myself, who was

767
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,895
originally Yaxha.

768
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,480
So Brandon, Danni and Bobby Jon

769
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,106
I think were tight when they

770
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,024
came over here.

771
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,150
They might be leaning towards

772
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,026
Amy.

773
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,277
So Amy is vulnerable if we lose

774
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,278
our next immunity.

775
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,321
>> If we don't freakin' win

776
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:44,738
immunity, right...

777
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,823
I'll be honest, I'm not going to

778
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,950
lie about anything, I'm just

779
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,328
going to sell myself.

780
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,370
You can lie.

781
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,455
>> I can lie.

782
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:53,955
>> But I'll kick your ass

783
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,290
afterwards.

784
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:56,083
I'm going to find you in

785
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,084
Michigan.

786
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,919
I'll put in Gary Hawkins, 46.

787
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,420
It'll come, bing, bing, bing.

788
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,756
Cell phones, address, maps.

789
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,174
I'll call the locals over there.

790
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,467
You can give me the lowdown on

791
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,260
Mr. Gary Hawkins,

792
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,261
ex-professional football player.

793
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,262
>> Ex-professional, yeah, I

794
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:09,513
wish.

795
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:10,472
>> Yeah.

796
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,933
If you are and I find out after,

797
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,392
I'm going to beat you down like

798
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,686
a stepchild.

799
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,396
>> What do you want me to do?

800
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:18,980
>> I'm going to beat you...

801
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,482
'cause, I don't care.

802
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,983
>> I know, can I make something

803
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,110
up?

804
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,152
>> I want people to give me

805
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:24,861
their word.

806
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:25,695
So I hope Gary doesn't

807
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:26,780
disappoint me.

808
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,281
If Gary is playing me, I'm going

809
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:28,657
to kick his ass.

810
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,494
I'm going to kick his ass.

811
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,703
>> Let's just not lose the

812
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,247
immunity, so you don't have to

813
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,331
cut my throat.

814
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:37,457
I'm trying to keep a straight

815
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,500
face.

816
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,751
I'm trying not to let her read

817
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:40,836
me, because she thinks she can

818
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,295
read people so well.

819
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,296
But, uh, she'll never find Gary

820
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,423
Hawkins in Grand Haven because

821
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,257
there is no such thing as a Gary

822
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:45,757
Hawkins in Grand Haven.

823
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,717
So she could be searching for

824
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,344
years.

825
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:49,970
>> "The history of the ancients

826
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,139
in this place have been

827
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,014
revealed.

828
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:53,765
Archaeologists unearthed the

829
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,308
mysteries, but still secrets are

830
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,600
concealed.

831
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,894
So you'll have to do some

832
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,104
digging to excavate the clues,

833
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,564
fail to put them together first

834
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:01,982
and one more tribe mate you will

835
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,275
lose."

836
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,025
Right now, it's a numbers game.

837
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:04,693
We need to win this challenge as

838
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:08,321
a tribe, so if there were a

839
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:08,864
merge, we've five on five.

840
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,492
>> Are you nervous?

841
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,953
>> In a good way.

842
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,079
>> Yeah, anxious.

843
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,122
>> I'm glad I'm in there.

844
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,707
If we don't win, and if we do

845
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,459
merge, we're going to be in a

846
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,211
mess.

847
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,088
We're going to be out-numbered

848
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:25,714
by two people, and they are just

849
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:31,219
going to pick us right off.

850
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,889
Today's the biggest day ever.

851
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,140
Bigger than any reward we're

852
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,141
going to see.

853
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,184
Bigger than anything for this

854
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:37,976
tribe.

855
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,227
I mean, this is it.

856
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,688
I mean, this is it.

857
00:24:51,031 --> 00:25:01,500
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

858
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,792
All right, shall we get to

859
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:03,752
today's challenge?

860
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,128
>> Yeah.

861
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,046
>> PROBST: Once again, immunity,

862
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,255
back up for grabs.

863
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:07,923
Today's immunity challenge will

864
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,300
test your ability to work

865
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,551
together as a team while solving

866
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,886
a puzzle.

867
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,512
Here is how it will work:

868
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,555
Three members from each tribe

869
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:16,723
are responsible for retrieving

870
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:17,766
giant puzzle pieces from the

871
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,601
sand pit.

872
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,603
On my go, one at a time, you'll

873
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:22,938
run out, attempting to find a

874
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,105
piece.

875
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:24,773
Each time you find a piece, you

876
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,317
bring it back, drop it in front

877
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,735
of your mat, and the next person

878
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:29,611
goes out.

879
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,987
Each person has to make at least

880
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,113
one attempt.

881
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:32,781
After that, go in any order you

882
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,574
choose.

883
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,618
Once you have collected all 12

884
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,329
pieces, two different tribe

885
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:40,580
members will race to assemble

886
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,123
the puzzle.

887
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:42,749
It resembles the Maya calendar.

888
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,418
First tribe to get it together

889
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,795
correctly wins immunity and a

890
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:47,837
one-in-ten-shot at a million

891
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,130
bucks.

892
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,215
Losers, Tribal Council, somebody

893
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,383
going home.

894
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:51,925
Nakum, you have one extra

895
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,593
member, you're sitting somebody

896
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:53,760
out.

897
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,679
Judd sat out the last challenge;

898
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:56,930
he cannot sit out this one.

899
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,098
>> Lydia.

900
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:59,099
>> PROBST: Lydia's going to sit

901
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,100
out.

902
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,476
Give you a minute to strategize.

903
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:04,312
We'll get started.

904
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,649
All right, running for Yaxha, it

905
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:11,069
is Brandon, Bobby Jon and Danni.

906
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:11,736
Running for Nakum: Jamie, Judd,

907
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,822
Cindy.

908
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,448
Here we go.

909
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,827
For immunity, Survivors, ready?

910
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,538
Go!

911
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:22,831
Brandon and Jamie first into the

912
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:23,915
sand.

913
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,542
Both quickly get the first

914
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,459
pieces.

915
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,503
>> Good job, Jamie!

916
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,425
>> PROBST: Judd and Bobby Jon

917
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,592
coming back with the second

918
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,720
pieces for both tribes.

919
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,348
Cindy is the first to start

920
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,391
digging.

921
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,767
Danni trying to find a piece she

922
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,519
can handle.

923
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:45,770
Cindy has got a piece.

924
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:46,688
They're heavy with that sand.

925
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,606
>> Good job, Cindy.

926
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,399
>> Good job. Good job.

927
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:50,233
>> PROBST: Cindy dragging back

928
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,276
the third puzzle piece for

929
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,360
Nakum.

930
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:52,736
Jamie back out.

931
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:53,778
>> Keep digging, keep digging.

932
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:54,863
>> PROBST: Danni found a piece,

933
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,656
but she can't lift it.

934
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,032
>> Tag out, Danni.

935
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:57,657
>> Tag out, Danni.

936
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,492
>> PROBST: Danni gives up.

937
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,329
Brandon back out.

938
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,622
Jamie with the fourth puzzle

939
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,541
piece for Nakum.

940
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:09,044
Nakum four, Yaxha two.

941
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,378
Brandon coming back with the

942
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,672
third piece for Yaxha.

943
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,049
Judd with the fifth piece

944
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:14,674
for Nakum.

945
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,593
>> Way to go, Judd.

946
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,636
>> PROBST: Nakum leads 5-3.

947
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,847

piece for Yaxha.

950
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:24,768
That's four for Yaxha.

951
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:27,020
There are only buried pieces

952
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,104
left.

953
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:28,730
Both tribes are going to have to

954
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,690
dig now.

955
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:31,066
>> Come on, Cindy.

956
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,193
Good job, Cindy.

957
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,361
There you go.

958
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,154
>> PROBST: Brandon back with

959
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:36,863
another piece for Yaxha.

960
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,240
Tied, five each.

Cindy with the sixth piece for

962
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,077

Jamie back out.

964
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:46,581

Both tribes now with six puzzle

967
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,044
pieces.

968
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,712
Danni has unearthed one.

969
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:53,838

970
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,049

Brandon back out.

973

00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:03,848
>> PROBST: Brandon has the

975
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,934
eighth piece for Yaxha.

piece for Nakum.

978

Bobby Jon, searching but not

979
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,606
finding anything.

980
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:12,315
>> Come on, brother!

981
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,650
Faster!

982
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,693
Judd with the eighth piece for

983
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,071

Jamie back out.

985
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,657
Bobby Jon has another piece.

Yaxha with nine pieces, Nakum

987
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,412

Jamie has another piece for

989
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,374
Nakum.

990
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,042
We are tied, both tribes with

991
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,377
nine.

Danni with the tenth piece for

993
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:35,880
Yaxha.

994
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:36,798
Yaxha has two pieces left;

995
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,050
Nakum has three.

996
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:39,884
Judd and Brandon on top of each

997
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:40,969
other.

Judd has a big piece.

999
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,557
And it's for Nakum.

1000
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,100
>> Keep digging, Brandon.

1001
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,518
>> PROBST: Both tribes with ten

1002
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:48,852
pieces.

1003
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,979
Hard to find those last pieces

1004
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,439
in all that sand.

1005
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,898
Brandon, still looking.

1006
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,401
>> Jamie, over to your left,

1007
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,318
right down there.

piece for Nakum.

>> Right here, Jamie.

1011
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,366
Right here.

1012
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:03,992
Jamie just threw the piece right

1013
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:04,909
into Steph's shin.

1014
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:05,994
>> Sorry.

1015
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,829
>> PROBST: Nakum with one piece

1016
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,289

Yaxha with two pieces left.

1018
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:11,833
>> I can't find it.

1019
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,460
Cindy searching for that last

1020
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,295
Nakum puzzle piece.

1021
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,171

00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,630
Cindy with the 12th piece for

1023
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,174
Nakum.

1024
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,885
Nakum is finished.

1025
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,011
Nakum can now begin assembling

1026
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,387
the puzzle.

1027
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,139
Steph and Rafe go to work.

1028
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,766

1029
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,643
>> PROBST: Brandon with the 11th

1030
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,896
piece for Yaxha.

1031
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,063
>> Go, go, go.

1032
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,231
>> PROBST: Yaxha has one piece

1033
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,357
left; Nakum already started

1034
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:36,900
putting the puzzle together.

1035
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,277
Bobby Jon, searching for that

1036
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,987
last puzzle piece.

1037
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,739
Yaxha falling behind.

1038
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:43,948
>> Keep going, Bobby Jon.

1039
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,408
>> I got it, I got it.

1040
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,743
>> Okay, hurry, hurry.

1041
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:47,368
>> PROBST: Bobby Jon with the

1042
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,912
final piece for Yaxha.

1043
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,581
Gary and Amy, starting to put

1044
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:52,040
the puzzle together.

1045
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,667
>> There you go.

1046
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:55,710
>> Good job, Yaxha.

1047
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:56,794
>> PROBST: They've got some time

1048
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:57,086
to make up.

1049
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,005
Remaining calm will be the key

1050
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,256
to this.

1051
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,132
>> Let's see this one.

1052
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,425
>> PROBST: Steph and Rafe with a

1053
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,593
big advantage for Nakum.

1054
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:05,678
Gary and Amy trying to catch up.

1055
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,472
>> That one, right there.

1056
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:08,056
>> Good job, Gary.

1057
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,933
>> PROBST: Gary with another

1058
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:10,308
piece for Yaxha.

1059
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,976
Nakum making a lot of progress,

1060
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,395
puzzle coming together nicely.

1061
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,813
>> Yeah, good one.

1062
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:16,064
Yeah.

1063
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,066
>> This piece I think goes over

1064
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:18,233
there.

1065
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,651
>> There you go.

1066
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:20,777
>> Great, just leave it there.

1067
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,402
>> PROBST: Nakum getting closer

1068
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,862
and closer.

1069
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,447
Yaxha is not that far behind.

1070
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,448
>> That one goes right there.

1071
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,616
>> PROBST: Very close.

1072
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:27,825
Very close.

1073
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:28,493
>> Help me out, help me out.

1074
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:29,619
>> PROBST: Nakum stuck with

1075
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:32,872
their last few pieces.

1076
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,290
Yaxha with only four pieces left

1077
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:38,169
You guys are very close.

1078
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,380
You got to move, Gary!

1079
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,757
You got to move Amy!

1080
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,967
Nakum may have figured it out.

1081
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,219
And they have!

1082
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,805
Nakum wins immunity!

1083
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:49,847
>> Yes!

1084
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,058
(<i> cheering</i> )

1085
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,313
>> PROBST: Nakum, unlike in the

1086
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,731
reward challenge, you worked

1087
00:30:58,815 --> 00:30:59,649
well together this time.

1088
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,025
You did not panic.

1089
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,111
Immunity is yours; no Tribal

1090
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:03,444
Council tonight.

1091
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,573
(<i> cheering</i> )

1092
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:07,156
Yaxha, sadly, for one of you,

1093
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,200
day 18 will be your last.

1094
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,952
Tribal Council tonight, somebody

1095
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,745
going home.

1096
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,204
Head on back to camp.

1097
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:17,667
I'll see you at Tribal.

1098
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,445
>> It's a devastating loss.

1099
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:46,029
It's a loss for my tribe, and

1100
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,698
it's a loss for myself.

1101
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,033
I knew going into this, if we

1102
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,492
didn't win immunity, I felt that

1103
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,118
I had an uphill battle, like I

1104
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:56,122
had that feeling.

1105
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,052
>> The one thing, you know, if I

1106
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,763
were you, I'd mention to Bobby

1107
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,056
Jon and Brandon, there will be a

1108
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:16,559
merge soon, I would think so.

1109
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:17,935
Thing is Danni, I probably could

1110
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:21,439
never outlast anybody here,

1111
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,733
or outplay anybody here.

1112
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,069
But the biggest attribute that I

1113
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:26,986
can possibly bring, to the

1114
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,072
people left here, is to outwit

1115
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,074
people.

1116
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:33,618
There is no one better on this

1117
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:34,160
island right here.

1118
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:37,121
>> You know, I would hate to

1119
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:42,085
vote Bobby Jon out, because last

1120
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:45,338
time he didn't get to go to the

1121
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:47,548
merge, you know?

1122
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,800
But that's like with anybody,

1123
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,009
nobody's had the chance to go.

1124
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,052
>> Is that an option?

1125
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,930
>> I don't know.

1126
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,014
Not going to be asking somebody

1127
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,724
like me back.

1128
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:57,350
>> I thought that wasn't fair at

1129
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,310
all for both of them to come

1130
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,603
back, because it's such a big

1131
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:01,896
advantage for the two of them.

1132
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:03,147
>> The fact that you just said

1133
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:06,150

But we bring somebody else with

us.

1136
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,446

angle.

1140
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,159
Nobody wants to vote anybody

1141
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,703
off, but Bobby Jon has been here

1142
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:17,245
two times in a row, so I'm

1143
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,914
thinking if I can get Gary to do

1144
00:33:19,997 --> 00:33:21,374
it and then we get Danni, you

1145
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,750
know, that's my last shot,

1146
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,211

>> Well, here's the deal.

1150
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:29,590
Danni and Brandon are running

1151
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,384
the show.

1152
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,635
>> You're right.

1153
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,928
>> Okay, and if they are looking

1154
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:35,388
for loyalty, I got to show to

1155
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:36,222
them loyalty.

1156
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,516
If they decide to go with Bobby

1157
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,143
Jon, I am with them.

1158
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,978
Danni's your play.

>> My angle right now is Gary.

1162
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,234
And I got to hope on Danni.

1163
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,236
Hopefully, there will be three

1164
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,195
votes for Bobby Jon.

1165
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,155
It will be a miracle, but I have

1166
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,490
had miracles in the past, so I

1167
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,074
won't be giving up on that.

chance to play this game before,

1226
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:47,728

complicated spot I have been in

1239
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:08,916

still here.

1244
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,078
It's got to feel fairly good at

00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:46,370
this point.

1246

good today.

00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:50,833

1250
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:52,585

>> I think this group that we

1257
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,470
have here is so tight just

1258
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,430
because the energy, the attitude

1259
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:07,725
and how close we have gotten

1260
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:08,476
after competing as hard as we

1261
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,269

1265
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:15,650
characterize this experience so

1266
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,652

1267
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:18,945
>> This is the bomb, right here.

1268
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:19,487
I went through things that I

1269
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,031
will never experience anywhere

1270
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,366

1271
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,742
You get to know these people.

1272
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,118
You go through tough times and

00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:35,419
voting someone out.

1278
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,464
You are sending them home.

1279
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:41,133
It's over, torch out, bye-bye.

1280
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:41,550

1282
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,054
difficult is that for you than

than I anticipated.

1286

The hardest part is justifying

1287
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:55,106
why you voted them out.

1288
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:55,982
Everything comes into

1289
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,149
consideration.

1290
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:57,775
You're like, okay, okay, I made

1291
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,318
alliances, and this person is

1292
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,695
not my alliance, got to vote

1293
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:01,529
them out.

1294
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,947
On the other hand, you think

1295
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,281
maybe a person in your alliance

1296
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,825
may not be as deserving to stay

1297
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:08,619
in this game, I mean, really

1298
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:09,745
shouldn't you keep the person

1299
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:13,374
that is deserving?

1300
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,292
>> PROBST: Danni, did you

1301
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,794
anticipate this dilemma of

1302
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,421
"deserving" because of how they

1303
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:19,755
play versus "deserving" because

1304
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:20,923
I gave them the word?

1305
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,383
>> Oh, I mean, yeah, I know that

1306
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,426
is how it goes.

1307
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,385
I feel it is just part of the

1308
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,512
game.

1309
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,055
But giving your word and keeping

1310
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,432
it sometimes is going to be hard

1311
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:30,558
in this game.

1315
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,438
vote anybody out?

1316
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,148
Do you look at every person and

1317
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,524
say they are valuable, or is it

1318
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:39,400
simply alliances, what is it?

1319
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,777
>> My only answer would be what

1320
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,780
kind of deal did you make with

1321
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:47,283
somebody on day two, on day

1322
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,326
three, on day four.

1323
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,745
For Bobby Jon, that's the only

1324
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:51,912
answer I have.

1325
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:52,496
I don't know about the other

1326
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,666
guys, but that's my answer.

1327
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,917
>> PROBST: Well, right or wrong,

1328
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,211
it is time to vote.

1329
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:03,883
Bobby Jon, you are up.

1330
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:12,433
>> You know, Amy, you're the

1331
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,769
strongest, most real human being

1332
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:15,436
I have ever met in my entire

1333
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,689
life, my entire life.

1334
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:19,565
I won't ever meet anybody more

1335
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,609
real than you, ever.

1336
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,589
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1337
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:45,591
votes.

1338
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,312
Once the votes are read, the

1339
00:39:58,395 --> 00:39:59,188
decision is final.

1340
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,564
Person voted out will be asked

1341
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,857
to leave the Tribal Council area

1342
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:02,900
immediately.

1343
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,944
I'll read the votes.

1344
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:08,697
First vote, Amy.

1345
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,160
Bobby Jon.

1346
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,954
One vote: Amy; one vote: Bobby

1347
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,580
Jon.

1348
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:19,959
Amy-- that's two Amy.

1349
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:24,880
>> Eighth person voted out of

1350
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:28,092
<i>Survivor: Guatemala:</i> Amy.

1351
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:28,717
That's three and that's enough.

1352
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,803
You need to bring me your torch.

1353
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,597
>> Play cool, guys.

1354
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:42,690
>> PROBST: Amy, the tribe has

1355
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,692
spoken.

1356
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,653
Time for you to go.

1357
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,667
Well, I am convinced after

1358
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,544
tonight's Tribal Council that

1359
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,837
you really have become a close

1360
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,173
group, and, hopefully, that will

1361
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,465
help you because you are about

1362
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:11,093
to embark on a new challenge.

1363
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,845
The four of you will not go back

1364
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:13,929
to your camp.

1365
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,222
You will go directly to Nakum's

1366
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:15,681
camp.

1367
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:18,142
You and Nakum are no longer two

1368
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,560
tribes; you're going to merge

1369
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,271
into one new tribe.

1370
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:22,897
All of your personal items, all

1371
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,441
the rewards you've won will be

1372
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:26,692
relocated.

1373
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,194
These are your new buffs.

1374
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,486
You guys are responsible for

1375
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,070
taking these buffs, delivering

1376
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,281
them, handing them out.

1377
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,782
And the ten of you need to

1378
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,576
decide on a new tribe name.

1379
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,119
Whole new game.

1380
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,162
Grab your torches, head out.

1381
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,247
Good night.

>> PROBST: And tempers flare at

1399
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:11,737
the new tribe.

1400
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,113
>> I don't care what you do.

1401
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,240
>> Dude, shut up, man.

1402
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,574
Shut up, man. I can't listen to

1403
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:16,867
you right now.

1404
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:23,749
>> I'm very proud of myself

1405
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:24,708
getting this far.

1406
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,127
You look down at your soul here

1407
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:27,586
out in Guatemala.

1408
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,172
You have absolutely nothing, and

1409
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:30,756
I have learned a tremendous

1410
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,800
amount of things I never knew

1411
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:33,884
about myself, and I will

1412
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:34,927
continue to learn about myself

1413
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,220
after this journey is over, when

1414
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:37,137
I get home. I made some

1415
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,180
great friends, and I had a great

1416
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,265
time, and, uh, I wouldn't want
