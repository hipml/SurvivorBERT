1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:06,373
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," DESPITE WINNING THE

2
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:10,377
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, THE DAVID
TRIBE HAD YET ANOTHER SETBACK.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,512
I SPRAINED MY LEG.

4
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:15,849
Jeff: THE GOLIATH TRIBE WAS
FACING TRIBAL COUNCIL AND

5
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:20,153
NATALIE WAS RUBBING SOME THE
WRONG WAY.

6
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:23,189
NATALIE IS USED TO BEING THE
BOSS BITCH.

7
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:25,992
Jeff: BUT ANGELINA SAW A
BIGGER PROBLEM.

8
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,996
JEREMY IS A MANIPULATOR.

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,566
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
ANGELINA GOT HER WAY WHEN THE

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,102
TRIBE VOTED UNANIMOUSLY FOR
JEREMY.

11
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:40,340
JEREMY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

12
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,542
17 ARE LEFT.

13
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:46,579
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.

14
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,358
Captioning funded by CBS

15
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:07,100
COME ON IN, GUYS.

16
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:10,236
DAVIDS GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK
AT THE NEW GOLIATH TRIBE.

17
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,406
JEREMY VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,476
WOW.

19
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:17,610
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

20
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:21,114
ITS BEEN A TOUGH TEN DAYS.

21
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:23,583
BI, YOUR KNEE IS WRAPPED AN
YOURE LIMPING.

22
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:24,651
WHATS GOING ON WITH YOU?

23
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:27,153
I ACTUALLY HAVE TO MAKE A
REALLY SAD ANNOUNCEMENT.

24
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:33,093
I SPRAINED MY MCL YESTERDAY, AND
IM AN ATHLETE, SO I HAVE MADE

25
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:37,263
THE DECISION TO LEAVE THE GAME.

26
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:40,133
THATS OKAY, BI.

27
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:40,800
THATS OKAY.

28
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,502
IM SO SORRY.

29
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:43,336
THATS OKAY.

30
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,771
ITS ALL RIGHT.

31
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:46,339
YOU GOT TO DO WHATS BEST FOR
YOU.

32
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:47,474
THATS REALLY SAD.

33
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,175
ITS OKAY.

34
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,777
Jeff: WHATS THE EMOTION,
ANGELINA?

35
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,648
WE WORKED SO HARD TO BE OUT.

36
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:59,919
ITS A DREAM FOR MOST PEOPLE,
AND TO SAY I CANT MOVE FORWARD

37
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,522
HAS TO BE ONE OF THE HARDEST
DECISIONS TO MAKE.

38
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:04,657
I HAVE RESPECT FOR HER DECISION.

39
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,460
I WISH THIS WASNT ONE SHE HAD
TO MAKE.

40
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:11,030
Jeff: IS IT CRAZY WHEN WE
THIS A SEASON CALLED DAVID

41
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:14,267
VERSUS GOLIATH, ITS NOT THE
GOLIATHS THAT HAVE SOMEBODY

42
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,235
EVACUATED.

43
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,903
ITS NOT THE GOLIATHS THAT HAVE
SOMEBODY QUIT.

44
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:19,005
ITS THE DAVID TRIBE, ONE
OBSTACLE AFTER ANOTHER.

45
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:22,108
YEAH, JEFF, YOU KNOW, WE
DOUBT OURSELVES HERE AND, THERE

46
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,511
BUT THE THING ABOUT DAVIDS IS
OUR ENDURANCE.

47
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,447
I THINK AS A TRIBE, YOU KNOW,
THIS WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE US

48
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,581
STRONGER.

49
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:31,784
Jeff: SO BI, WHEN YOU GO
BACK HOME AND YOU REFLECT ON

50
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,986
THIS EXPERIENCE, WHAT WAS IT?

51
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,523
I MEAN, THESE ARE A BAND OF
MISFITS.

52
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:39,626
IM GLAD THAT I WAS FORCED TO
GET TO KNOW THEM, BECAUSE

53
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,762
THEYRE AMAZING HUMAN BEING,
EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM.

54
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:44,197
I KNOW THEYRE GOING TO ROCK IT.

55
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,232
BUT SAD TO SAY IT WONT BE WITH
ME.

56
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,767
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

57
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,469
BI HAS MADE HER DECISION.

58
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,737
BI IS QUITTING THE GAME.

59
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,771
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

60
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:53,406
HEAD DOWN TO THE WATERS EDGE.

61
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:59,078
WELL GRAB A BOAT FOR YOU, PICK
YOU UP.

62
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,880
GREAT WORK, BI.

63
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,982
REALLY.

64
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,117
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

65
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,088
ANOTHER UNPREDICTABLE MOMENT IN
WHAT SO FAR HAS BEEN AN

66
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,991
UNPREDICTABLE SEASON THAT IS
ABOUT TO HAVE ANOTHER

67
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,526
UNPREDICTABLE TWIST.

68
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,594
EVERYBODY DROP YOUR BUFFS.

69
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:15,929
OH, MY GOD.

70
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,597
I FREAKIN KNEW IT, JEFF.

71
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,165
Jeff: WE ARE SWITCHING
TRIBES.

72
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,900
LETS PLAY THIS GAME, BABY.

73
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:25,271
HEARING "DROP YOUR BUFFS" IS
TERRIFYING TO SOME, BUT THEN TO

74
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:28,374
ME IT WAS LIKE, NOW ITS REALLY
TIME TO PLAY THE GAME.

75
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:32,111
IM HERE FOR THE PART WHEN ITS
TIME TO BACKSTAB AND LIE AND

76
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,781
TURN OTHER PEOPLE AGAINST EACH
OTHER.

77
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:35,415
THAT DEVIL IS DAVIE.

78
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,450
IM READY TO DO ALL THAT.

79
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:38,585
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

80
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:39,752
EVERYBODY REVEAL YOUR NEW
BLUFFS.

81
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,254
PURPLE.

82
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,156
PURPLE.

83
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,892
ORANGE.

84
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,126
I HAVE A NEW COLOR.

85
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,694
PURPLE.

86
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,895
PURPLE.

87
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:52,398
Jeff: AS YOU START TO OPEN
THEM, YOU WILL SEE THERE IS A

88
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:53,233
THIRD COLOR.

89
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,334
GREEN.

90
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:59,405
Jeff: WE ARE SWITCHING FROM
TWO TRIBES TO THREE.

91
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,177
THE MOST DISAPPOINTING PART
FOR ME WAS WATCHING KARA OPEN

92
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,011
HERS.

93
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:08,881
I WAS LIKE, WHAT IS HER, WHAT IS
MINE.

94
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,950
OH, THAT WAS ROUGH.

95
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,653
CARL AINT GOT ONE.

96
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:16,522
Jeff: AND IF YOU DONT HAVE
A BUFF, IT MEANS YOU DONT HAVE

97
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:17,190
A TRIBE.

98
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:18,324
CARL, THAT IS YOU.

99
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,894
IF YOURE ON THE ORANGE TRIBE,
MOVE TO THE ORANGE MAT.

100
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,098
IF YOURE ON THE PURPLE TRIBE,
MOVE TO THE PURPLE MAT.

101
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,267
IF YOU ARE GREEN, GO IN THE
MIDDLE.

102
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:27,800
CARL.

103
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,102
YOU DONT HAVE A BUFF.

104
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,737
COME RIGHT OVER HERE.

105
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,605
ANGELINA.

106
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,842
NATALIA.

107
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,176
IT WILL BE GREAT.

108
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,212
WELL HAVE A GOOD TIME.

109
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,714
SLAM TOWN.

110
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:42,949
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

111
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,585
THE OBVIOUS FIRST REACTION IS
THE GOLIATHS HAVE THE ADVANTAGE

112
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,720
IN EVERY SINGLE TRIBE.

113
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,089
LETS START WITH THE ORANGE
TRIBE.

114
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,993
YOUR NAME NOW IS VUKU.

115
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,095
WE HAVE THREE FORMER GOLIATHS.

116
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,399
WE HAVE NATALIA, KARA AND ALEC.

117
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,201
WE HAVE TWO FORMER DAVID, DAVIE
AND ELIZABETH.

118
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:07,407
IN THE MIDDLE, THE GREEN TRIBE,
YOUR TRIBE NAME, TEVA.

119
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,142
YEAH.

120
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:13,813
Jeff: AND WE HAVE THREE
FORMER GOLIATHS WITH JOHN, DAN,

121
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:18,985
AND ALISON, AND TWO FORMER
DAVIDS WITH CHRISTIAN AND GABBY.

122
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:24,757
DOWN ON THE PURPLE TRIBE, YOUR
NAME IS JIBINI, THE SAME

123
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,761
BREAKDOWN, THREE FORMER GOLIATH,
NATALIE, MIKE, AND ANGELINA, AND

124
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:35,768
TWO FORMER DAVIDS WITH LYRSA,
HANDS ON HER HIP, AND NICK.

125
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,403
THAT BRINGS US TO YOU, CARL.

126
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:38,638
HERES WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN TO
YOU.

127
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,672
YOURE GOING TO EXILE ISLAND.

128
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,441
WOW, WOW.

129
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:46,012
Jeff: YOU WILL RETURN TO
THE GAME AT THE NEXT TRIBAL

130
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:50,383
COUNCIL, JOINING THE TRIBE THAT
LOSES THE NEXT IMMUNITY

131
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,185
CHALLENGE AND HAS TO VOTE
SOMEBODY OUT.

132
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:55,054
SO WHOEVER LOSES GETS CARL AS
THEIR REPLACEMENT.

133
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,290
CARL, GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD DOWN
THE BEACH.

134
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,291
BOAT IS WAITING.

135
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:01,361
THERE IS MAN -- MAP TO EXILE.

136
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,762
GOOD LUCK, CARL.

137
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:03,329
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

138
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,864
EN THE DAYS IN.

139
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:07,300
ONCE AGAIN THE GAME HAS CHANGED.

140
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:12,271
VUKU, JIBINI, GRAB YOUR STUFF,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

141
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,841
TEVA, NEW BEACH, NO SHELTER,
STARTING OVER.

142
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,376
HERES A MAP TO YOUR NEW HOME.

143
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,343
THANK YOU.

144
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,444
.

145
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:19,645
Jeff: YOURE WELCOME.

146
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:23,649
BASICALLY THE ENTIRE TRIBE
SYSTEM HAS BEEN GERRYMANDERED

147
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:24,550
AGAINST THE DAVIDS.

148
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:25,685
THATS NOT GOOD.

149
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:29,389
WE WERE ONLY DOWN 9-7, BUT CARL
IS OFF ON AN ISLAND, AND

150
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,758
EVERYONE IS EVENLY DISTRIBUTED
INTO A MINORITY.

151
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:41,701
SO THE DAVIDS ARE COLLECTIVELY
IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.

152
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,637
NO WAY.

153
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,039
THIS IS SO SICK.

154
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,674
THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER.

155
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,309
WE HAVE CHAIRS.

156
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,011
WE GOT HAMMOCKS.

157
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,579
YOU GUYS ARE SO HAPPY.

158
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,581
OUR CAMP SUCKS COMPARED TO
THIS.

159
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,818
WHEN JEFF SAID DROP YOUR
BUFFS, I WAS LIKE, THIS COULD BE

160
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,052
TROUBLE.

161
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:04,857
FORTUNATELY FOR US, WE GOT THREE
GOLIATHS, SO MYSELF, KARA AND

162
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:09,295
NATALIA, AND THEN TWO DAVID,
DAVIE AND ELIZABETH.

163
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,430
SO WE HAVE THE NUMBERS.

164
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,800
SO IM SUPER PSYCHED ABOUT THAT.

165
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,067
IM MARRIED.

166
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,403
I HAVE THREE KIDS.

167
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,505
YOU CHEER?

168
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,007
IM RETIRED.

169
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,741
ILL CHEER FOR US.

170
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,409
WE HAVE A REALLY STRONG
TRIBE.

171
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,479
WE DONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
ANYTHING ELSE, JUST WIN.

172
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,748
THIS IS REALLY MESSED UP.

173
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:32,385
EVERY SINGLE TRIBE HAS GOLIATH
AS THE MAJORITY.

174
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:35,021
SO THAT ABSOLUTELY CHANGES OUR
STRATEGY.

175
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,290
IM STOKED WITH THIS NEW
TRIBE, BRO.

176
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:38,257
ME, TOO MAN.

177
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,859
WERE ALL FINDS CAL.

178
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,093
WE HAVE A GREAT BALANCE.

179
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:45,031
WE GOT THE FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO GET IN WITH THESE GOLIATHS.

180
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:48,868
IM ASHAMED TO SAY I HAVENT
BEFRIENDED TOO MANY CAUCASIANS.

181
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,838
ITS IN THE THAT I HAVENT
WANTED TO, BUT IVE JUST BEEN

182
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,674
AROUND BLACK PEOPLE MY WHOLE
LIFE, BUT I AM BLACK NERD.

183
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,009
LIKE I DRIVE A FREAKIN P.T.

184
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,177
CRUISER.

185
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:01,647
IM THE BLACK GUY THAT WHITE
PEOPLE LOVE TO APPROACH, HEY,

186
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:02,448
NICE CAR.

187
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,150
SO HOPEFULLY ILL BE ABLE TO FIT
IN.

188
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:07,720
IM NOTHING LIKE THE REST OF
MY FAMILY.

189
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:10,957
THEYRE NOT REDNECK LIKE I AM.

190
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,092
I WAS EXTREMELY CONSERVATIVE.

191
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,161
I WAS RAISED REALLY
CHRISTIAN.

192
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,996
I THINK FAITH IS SO IMPORTANT TO
HAVE OUT HERE.

193
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,097
FOR SURE.

194
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:23,035
I WAS LITERALLY QUOTING
SCRIPTURE IN MY HEAD THE WHOLE

195
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,104
BOAT RIDE OVER HERE.

196
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:28,908
THEY HAVE US OUTNUMBERED, SO
GETTING OUT OF THIS ALIVE IS

197
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,944
GOING TO BE HARD, BUT IM NOT
AFRAID OF HARD WORK.

198
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,646
ITS DEFINITELY TIME TO PULL OUT
ALL THE STOPS.

199
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,983
IM GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN
TO FIND COMMON GROUND.

200
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,886
I USED TO HAVE HORSES AND
TRAIN HORSES.

201
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,153
DID YOU EVER COMPETE?

202
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,789
I USED TO WHEN I WAS LITTLE?

203
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:44,790
WESTERN PLEASURE?

204
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:45,958
SADDLE SEAT.

205
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,895
NO WAY, SO YOU HAD THE SAME
ENGLISH GETUP THAT I DID IN.

206
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:49,495
YES.

207
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,297
THATS HILARIOUS, MAN.

208
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,198
THE LONG COAT.

209
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,566
AND THE TOP HAT.

210
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:54,300
THATS AWESOME.

211
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,435
MY FIRST HORSE WAS AN
ARABIAN.

212
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,737
THEN WE GOT A SEATTLE BRED.

213
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,171
THATS AWESOME.

214
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,172
I LOVED IT.

215
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,741
I WISH I HAD A REPORTS.

216
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,142
YEAH.

217
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:07,613
CAREBACK MY BEST ALLY IN THIS
GAME, MY MOST IMPORTANT ALLY IN

218
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,383
THIS GAME, IS GETTING ALONG WITH
ELIZABETH WAY TOO MUCH.

219
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,184
THEY HAVE TOO MANY THINGS IN
COMMON.

220
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,452
IM GETTING NERVOUS.

221
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:17,690
IM LIKE, THESE TOO ARE WAY TOO
CLOSE AND IM NOT OKAY WITH IT.

222
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,858
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

223
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,593
IM NOT GOING TO LIE.

224
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,428
IM SCARED, BECAUSE YOU GUYS
HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

225
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:23,829
I DONT WANT YOU TO FLIP ON ME.

226
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:27,333
OH,, NO IM TRYING TO MAKE
CAMP LIFE EASY.

227
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:30,336
YOU KNOW ME, IM SO LOYAL TO YOU
GUYS.

228
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:34,941
ALL OF A SUDDEN NATALIA IS
NERVOUS.

229
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,676
SHES WORRIED I MIGHT JUMP SHIP.

230
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,544
IT CONCERNS ME.

231
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:44,717
SHES FREAKED OUT THAT I WOULD
FLIP ON ELIZABETH.

232
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,252
I WOULD NEVER FLIP.

233
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,386
WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT OF THAT.

234
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,921
THERE IS NOTHING THAT NEEDS TO
BE QUESTIONED.

235
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,690
IT WOULD NOT MAKE SENSE.

236
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,558
IM NOT SURPRISED AT ALL.

237
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,561
I KNEW THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON
ITS HARD FOR HER TO TRUST

238
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,362
PEOPLE.

239
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:59,565
BUT WE HAVE A FOOL-PROOF PLAN.

240
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:08,407
SCREWING THIS UP WOULD BE DUMB.

241
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,811
HELL, IM STUCK HERE ON EXILE
ISLAND.

242
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,646
NOBODY TO TALK TO.

243
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,049
OF COURSE, E-MAIL A TRUCK
DRIVER, SO IVE BEEN ALONE, BUT

244
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,853
IM ABLE TO PICK UP THE PHONE OR
STOP AT A TRUCK STOP AND GO TALK

245
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,355
TO SOMEBODY OR WHAT NOT.

246
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:26,726
SO AS FAR AS BEING ON EXILE, I
HAVE NEVER BEEN ALONE LIKE THIS

247
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:34,767
BEFORE.

248
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,536
OH, BOY.

249
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:42,408
FROM A TREE BY A ROCKY POINT I
FELL AND ROLLED THROUGH THE SAND

250
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:46,412
AND NOW HERE I AM, SOON TO BE
WASHED AWAY WITH THE TIDE.

251
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:49,582
IF YOU CATCH ME IN TIME AND
RECOGNIZE MY MARK, YOUR TIME ON

252
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:53,819
EXILE WILL BE WORTH IT.

253
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,254
A TREE.

254
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:59,058
AS I READ THE RIDDLE, IT STARTED
COMING TO ME THIS A COCONUT THAT

255
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,528
WAS IN THE OCEAN BY THE SHORE
MIGHT HAVE AN ADVANTAGE INSIDE

256
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:03,496
OF IT.

257
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:13,572
SO I IMMEDIATELY GET UP AND RUN
TO THE BEACH.

258
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:18,411
SO I IMMEDIATELY GET UP AND RUN
TO THE BEACH.

259
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,781
ONCE I GET OUT THERE, I SEE THAT
THERES TONS AND TONS OF

260
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:22,982
COCONUTS.

261
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:27,119
SO I START GOING CRAZY TRYING TO
GATHER AS MANY COCONUTS AS I

262
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:31,824
COULD.

263
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,126
THIS OCEAN AINT NOTHING TO PLAY
WITH.

264
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,733
IM GETTING BASHED AROUND THE
ROCKS BY WAVES.

265
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,669
AND I CANT FIND THAT DAMN
COCONUT TO SAVE MY LIFE.

266
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,405
ITS LIKE A NEEDLE IN A
HAYSTACK, BUT THERES NOTHING

267
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:52,745
THAT IVE EVER DONE IN LIFE THAT
I JUST SAID I QUIT.

268
00:11:52,778 --> 00:12:00,986
AND THEN I SEE IT.

269
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:05,691
WOW.

270
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,559
CONGRATULATIONS.

271
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,027
YOU HAVE FOUND AN ADVANTAGE IN
THE GAME.

272
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,897
THIS IS AN IDOL NULLIFIER.

273
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:16,168
IT BLOCKS THE USE OF AN IDOL BY
ANY OTHER PLAYER.

274
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,805
HERES HOW IT WORKS: YOU WILL
LAY THIS IN SECRET WHEN YOU VOTE

275
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,874
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

276
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,010
WRITE THE NAME OF THE PERSON YOU
WANT TO BLOCK FROM USING AN

277
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,245
IDOL.

278
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,848
IF AN IDOL IS PLAYED FOR THEM,
THIS ADVANTAGE WILL NULLIFY THE

279
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,117
IDOL.

280
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,451
SWEET.

281
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,353
SO THIS IS THE NULLIFIER.

282
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:38,624
IF I GUESS CORRECTLY WHO IS
PLAYING AN IDOL, I CAN PLAY THIS

283
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:42,661
NULLIFIER, PUT THEIR NAME DOWN,
AND THAT IDOL BASICALLY BECOMES

284
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:43,896
NULL AND VOID.

285
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,032
I GUESS I NEVER THOUGHT COMING
TO EXILE WOULD BE REWARDING.

286
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,668
FINDING THIS ADVANTAGE IS HUGE,
BUT I HAVE THE PLAY IT IN THE

287
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:50,870
RIGHT MANNER.

288
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,839
SO WHEN THE TIME COMES, IM
GOING TO USE THIS NULLIFIER JUST

289
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,776
LIKE THE SLING THAT SHOT GOLIATH
IN BETWEEN THE EYES AND TOOK HIM

290
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,811
OUT.

291
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:10,990
WELCOME,.

292
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,092
WELCOME.

293
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,927
IM NATALIE.

294
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,263
NICK, NICE TO MEET YOU.

295
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:21,433
I FEEL LIKE THIS NEW TRIBE IS
THE DAVIDS OF THE DAVIDS OF THE

296
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,668
DAVIDS.

297
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:28,941
I THINK EVERYONE ON THE JIBINI
TRIBE WOULD BE THE LAST FIVE WER

298
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,342
TEAMS, AND WERE ALL NOW ON ONE
TRIBE.

299
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,144
IM GOING TO BE SEEING TRIBAL
COUNCIL A LOT THE NEXT COUPLE

300
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:32,745
DAYS.

301
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:33,846
SO YOURE A SCREENWRITER?

302
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,047
I AM.

303
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,983
STUFF WEVE SEEN BEFORE?

304
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:42,121
PEOPLE KNOW ME FROM THE MOVIE
"SCHOOL OF ROCK."

305
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,389
I KNEW IT!

306
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,991
IT FEELS WEIRD TO HAVE THE
DAVIDS IN MY CAMP.

307
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:51,964
I WANT THEM GONE.

308
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:55,067
I DIDNT FEEL LIKE GOING
THROUGH THE WHOLE INTRODUCTION

309
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,269
AND GETTING TO KNOW THEM,
BECAUSE THE GOLIATHS ARE STILL

310
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:57,903
IN CONTROL.

311
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,038
WE HAVE THE NUMBERS.

312
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:02,408
SO NICK WOULD YOU AND
ANGELINA START THE FIRE, AND IF

313
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,977
YOU DONT MIND, THE POT IS
LOOKING A LITTLE --

314
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,747
I THINK NATALIA CLEANED IT
THIS MORNING BUT ILL GO DOWN

315
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:09,982
AND TOO IT.

316
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,418
THE PRIORITY IS TO GET THE
FIRE DOING, BECAUSE ONCE THE SUN

317
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,887
FALLS, IF YOU DONT HAVE YOUR
THINGS IN ORDER, YOU JUST WONT

318
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,989
HAVE THEM FOR THE NIGHT.

319
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,290
THERE YOU GO.

320
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,291
THERE YOU GO.

321
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:19,892
OKAY.

322
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:20,993
YOU GOT TO PUT SOME WOOD.

323
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,762
YOU GOT THE FEED IT RIGHT AWAY
ORITS GOING TO GO OUT.

324
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,497
SEE HOW FAST ITS GOING.

325
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,801
PUT THAT LINEN BY YOUR HAND,
YOUR RIGHT HAND, PICK UP THAT

326
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,236
LINEN PIECE BY YOUR RIGHT HAND.

327
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:30,903
PUT THAT ON THERE.

328
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,137
THAT BURNS QUICKLY.

329
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:37,810
THE TYPICAL NATALIE STYLE IS
TO KIND OF SIT ON HER THRONE,

330
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:41,647
LOOK AT HER PEASANTS AND TELL
THEM WHAT TO DO.

331
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,283
KEEP FEEDING IT, ANGELINA.

332
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:45,451
YOU HAVE TO BLOW.

333
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:48,354
FEED WITH IT THE SMALL PIECES OF
WOOD, THE REAL THIN ONES.

334
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,422
SEE HOW ITS SITTING ON THE
SIDE.

335
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:51,590
LIKE THAT.

336
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,826
I THINK WE NEED A COUPLE OF
BIGGER PIECES THAT ARE THICK.

337
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,427
I DONT THINK SO, NICK.

338
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:59,531
HOW ABOUT THAT WHITE ONE OVER
THERE, NICK?

339
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,966
ANGELINA, THIS IS YOUR FIRE.

340
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,438
KEEP FEEDING IT.

341
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:12,344
YEP.

342
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:15,814
IT WASNT A FEW HOURS INTO
THIS TRIBE WHERE I SAW A CRACK,

343
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,483
AND ITS NAME WAS NATALIE.

344
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:21,553
SO EVEN THOUGH NATALIE IS
BOSSINESS IS TOUGH TO LISTEN TO,

345
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:25,457
ITS ALMOST LIKE SWEET MUSIC TO
MY EARS, BECAUSE I KNOW ITS NOT

346
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:28,727
JUST TOUGH ON ME, ITS TOUGH ON
EVERYBODY.

347
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,362
SHE DRIVES ME CRAZY.

348
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,931
YEAH.

349
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,667
YOU FEEL LIKE SHE COULD GO
NEXT?

350
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,435
ITS A LONGER CONVERSATION.

351
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:37,636
WELL HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT.

352
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,508
WELL, I GET A GOOD VIBE FOR
FROM YOU FOR SURE.

353
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,044
I GET A GOOD VIBE FROM YOU.

354
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:48,814
MY INITIAL GOAL WAS TRY NOT
TO PLAY TOO FAST OR TOO HARD,

355
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,616
BECAUSE THATS WHAT I LOVE TO
DO.

356
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,819
I KNOW A THERE IS NO WAY A DAVID
IS GOING TO WIN THIS GAME ONLY

357
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:54,987
PLAYING WITH DAVIDS.

358
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,990
I SEE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD A
RELATIONSHIP WITH A GHIET.

359
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:00,626
ID LOVE TO START AN
ALLIANCE.

360
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:01,527
ID LOVE THAT.

361
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,728
OKAY.

362
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:03,262
AWESOME.

363
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,330
I REALLY LIKE NICK.

364
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:08,233
HE SEEMS VERY UNPRETENTIOUS,
VERY SALT OF THE EARTH.

365
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,169
YOU WANT TO NAME THE
ALLIANCE.

366
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,503
WOULDNT THAT BE AWESOME?

367
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:14,707
LETS TAKE A SECOND TO THINK
ABOUT IT, THEN WELL HAVE TO

368
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,708
COME UP WITH A GOOD ONE.

369
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:19,845
I WAS THINKING THE ROCK
STARS, IF YOU LIKE IT?

370
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:20,479
WE CAN DO IT.

371
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:21,914
ALL RIGHT.

372
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:25,951
SO IM HAPPY THAT WE CREATED
THAT BOND.

373
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:31,156
YOU REALLY DONT THINK ANYONE
ON YOUR SIDE HAS AN IDOL?

374
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,191
I REALLY DONT.

375
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:35,561
THE PERSON WHO HAS AN IDOL ON
MY SIDE IS DAN.

376
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:36,695
YOURE PRETTY SURE?

377
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:37,830
I KNOW HE DOES.

378
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:41,567
NOTHING WOULD MAKE ME
HAPPENNER WITH THAN IF THIS ROCK

379
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,569
STAR ALLIANCE BORE FRUIT.

380
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,637
BUT I HAVE MORE AT RISK THAN HE
DOES.

381
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,172
THE GOLIATHS DO HAVE THE
NUMBERS.

382
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:50,843
WELL SEE IF WE CAN LIVE UP TO
THAT ALLIANCE.

383
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:57,216
THE ROCK STARS.

384
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:00,786
YOU NEED ME TO BRACE IT ANY
WAY OR JUST STAY OUT OF YOUR

385
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:01,854
SWINGING RADIUS HERE?

386
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:05,124
THERE IS A DIFFERENT VIBE WHEN
YOU HAVE THEE OF THESE

387
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,291
STEREOTYPICAL GOLIATHS WITH US.

388
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:09,261
WHEN JOHN JUST SWINGS HIS
MACHETE AND JUST SORT OF SMASHES

389
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:12,231
THROUGH THIS PIECE OF BAMBOO,
THATS A NEW THING.

390
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:16,301
THATS NOT HOW I CHOP BAMBOO,
THATS JUST A STYLISTIC

391
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,737
DIFFERENCE.

392
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,239
CHRISTIAN, LET ME HELP YOU.

393
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,607
I WILL WALK AND LEARN.

394
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,909
YOU WANT TO CHOP THINGS AT AN
ANGLE.

395
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:26,178
CHRISTIAN, HE WANTS TO HELP.

396
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,413
HE WANTS TO BE INVOLVED.

397
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,282
AT THE SAME TIME, HES WILLING
TO PUT DOWN THAT EGO AND LISTEN

398
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,683
TO OTHER PEOPLE, WHICH IS GREAT.

399
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,685
I GOT FIRST PART RIGHT.

400
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,422
NOW ILL ROTATE A LITTLE BIT.

401
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,224
IM DOING WHATEVER I CAN IN
ORDER TO CONTRIBUTE AS MUCH AS I

402
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:42,061
CAN, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I
HAVE TO MAKE SURE IM AT THE TOP

403
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:46,165
OF MY SOCIAL GAME, SO I GOT TO
GO ON A CHARM OFFENSIVE HERE,

404
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,067
AND THATS REALLY UNDERSTATING
IT.

405
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,370
I REALLY NEED SORT OF CHARM
NUCLEAR WARFARE, SO TIME TO

406
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:58,210
BRING ABOUT THE CHARM POCOLYPS.

407
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:03,282
I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT SLAM
TOWN.

408
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:06,718
SLAM TOWN IS THE PLACE I SAY
IM GOING TO TAKE MY WRESTLING

409
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,254
OPPONENTS SOME SLAM TOWN IS
POPULATED BY PEOPLE WHO YOU HAVE

410
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:09,922
SLAMMED?

411
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,924
CHRISTIAN IS A QUICKIE GUY?

412
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,226
I FOR SURE HAVE A TON OF
QUICKIENESS IN ME.

413
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,961
I HAVE A CONFIDENT PUBLIC PER
SEW NAP.

414
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:19,064
IM USED TO PERFORMING IN FRONT
OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, BUT

415
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,100
SOMETIMES IN SMALLER GROUPS LIKE
THIS.

416
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,868
I DO GET A LITTLE BIT AWKWARD.

417
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:27,339
I RUN OUT OF THINGS TO SAY,
SELF-DOUBT, INSECURITY, ALITTLE

418
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:30,509
BIT OF SOCIAL AWKWARDNESS, FOR
SURE I GOT, THAT BIG TIME.

419
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:35,681
SO I WAS MOSTLY CURIOUS ABOUT
THE AVAILABILITY OF A

420
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:36,548
COMPTROLLER POSITION.

421
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:39,284
WERE CONSTANTLY FIELDING
INTERVIEWS.

422
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,653
YOU HAVE A PORTAL?

423
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,555
I DONT HAVE ACCESS TO IT.

424
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:48,060
I ALREADY FEEL LIKE CHRISTIAN
HAS A SPECIAL BOND WITH HIS DUDE

425
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:49,228
BROS.

426
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,563
IT MAKES ME WORRY A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT MY PLACE ON THE TRIBE.

427
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:56,735
I ALWAYS STRUGGLE KNOWING THAT
PEOPLE PROBABLY LIKE ME BUT

428
00:18:56,768 --> 00:19:01,473
HAVING THAT LITTLE VOICE OF
SELF-DOUBT THAT SAYS, WELL, WHAT

429
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:11,650
IF THEY DONT.

430
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,485
IM NOT HAPPY WITH HOW THINGS
TURNED OUT.

431
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,521
GIVE YOURSELF A LITTLE TIME.

432
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,321
YOURE DOING OKAY.

433
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,624
I DONT KNOW.

434
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,559
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

435
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:24,363
WHOA, WHOA.

436
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,297
WERE TOGETHER.

437
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,098
YOURE DOING FINE.

438
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,332
YOURE DOING FINE.

439
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,568
YOURE DOING FINE.

440
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:37,476
I FEEL LIKE IM ON THE
BOTTOM.

441
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:42,147
IM AFRAID TO OPEN UP TO
PEOPLE.

442
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,583
THEYRE SO INTIM DATING.

443
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:45,851
YOURE DOING GREAT.

444
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:46,852
YOURE SO CHARMING.

445
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:49,254
I FEEL LIKE IF WE LOSE IM GOING
TO GO.

446
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,490
GABBY AND I ARE PEAS IN A
POD.

447
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,258
WERE IN THIS TOGETHER.

448
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,928
WHEN I AM AT MY LOW, SHES
STRONG.

449
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,697
WHEN SHES AT HER LOW, IM
STRONG.

450
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,899
IM THERE TO DRY HER TEARS.

451
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,834
IM THERE TO TRY TO KEEP HER
HEAD IN THE GAME.

452
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:08,740
I DO MUCH BETTER WITH
VULNERABLE PEOPLE AND WEIRDOES.

453
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:14,646
I DONT WELL AROUND LIKE THESE
GOLIATHS.

454
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,549
THEY HAVE THEIR
VULNERABILITY, TOO, THEY JUST

455
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,750
DONT LIKE THE SHOW IT.

456
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:21,820
I FEEL LIKE CHRISTIAN IS SO
MUCH BETTER AT BEING CHARMING

457
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:25,457
AND BEING LIKABLE AND BEING
HIMSELF.

458
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,526
AND I ENVY HIM FOR THAT.

459
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,863
I JUST FEEL LIKE THEYRE THE
COOL KIDS AT THE LUNCH TABLE.

460
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:36,168
AN IM STANDING THERE ASKING IF
I CAN SIT WITH THEM.

461
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:38,737
RIGHT NOW I FEEL LIKE THE ONLY
PERSON I CAN LEAN ON IS

462
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,973
CHRISTIAN, AND I DONT KNOW IF
THATS ENOUGH.

463
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:44,576
I FEEL LIKE IM IN A DESPERATE
POSITION BECAUSE IM SCARED OF

464
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,612
GOING HOME.

465
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:17,542
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

466
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:18,677

LETS GET TO YOUR FIRST IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE AS NEW TRIBES.

FIRST THINGS FIRST, CARBACK --
KARA, GOT TO TAKE BACK THE IDOL.

ANGELINA, NATALIE, AND NICK
ARE STUCK.

522
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,663
TELL US WHAT TO DO.

523
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:53,198
STOP, STOP, STOP.

524
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:56,435
Jeff: KARA PICKING UP THE
PACE FOR VUKU IN ORANGE.

525
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:57,636
GREEN IS THROUGH THE SECOND
PHASE.

526
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:58,703
STRAIGHT.

527
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,373
Jeff: GABBY CONTINUES TO DO
A NICE JOB AS CALLER.

528
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:04,843
HERE COMES KARA WITH DAVIE AND
ALICE DOING THE PUSHING.

529
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:07,579
THEY ARE THROUGH THE SECOND
PHASE NOW.

530
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:11,783
GABBY NOW GETTING TO THE LAST
PART OF THE THIRD STAGE.

531
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:15,287
YOU HAVE TO UNTIE THE BAG
CONTAINING THE BALL THAT WILL

532
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,589
SOLVE THE TABLE MAZE.

533
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,691
IF ANGELINA COULD JUST GET
THROUGH THIS SECOND PHASE, THEY

534
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:20,992
CAN GET BACK IN IT.

535
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,562
WERE GOING TO GO OFF THE
RAMP.

536
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,697
Jeff: TWO TRIBES ARE
WINNING IMMUNITY.

537
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,433
THE REWARD IS THE BONUS, BUT
WHAT YOU WANT IS IMMUNITY.

538
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,235
STRAIGHT, STRAIGHT, STRAIGHT.

539
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:31,403
Jeff: YOURE GOOD!

540
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,705
GABBY IS THROUGH ALL THREE
PHASES FOR TEVA.

541
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:34,773
YES!

542
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,008
Jeff: GABBY IS GOING TO
LEAD CHRISTIAN AND ALISON

543
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,276
THROUGH THE TABLE MAZE.

544
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,912
SO YOUR GOING TO GO TO THE
LEFT SIDE.

545
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:41,513
ALISON DOWN.

546
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:42,647
GO STRAIGHT A LITTLE BIT.

547
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:45,116
Jeff: KARA GETTING CLOSER
TO THAT BALL, FINISHING THE

548
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:45,750
THIRD SECTION.

549
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:46,918
WATCH OUT FOR THAT POLE.

550
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:47,686
WERE THROUGH.

551
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:48,854
WERE THROUGH THIS PART.

552
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:50,822
Jeff: PURPOSELE IS THROUGH
THE THIRD PHASE, BUT THEYRE

553
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:52,791
HEADING THE WRONG DIRECTION.

554
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,859
ONCE AGAIN COSTING THEM TIME.

555
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:55,093
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

556
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:56,328
ITS COSTING US TIME.

557
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:57,896
NATALIE, STAY CALM.

558
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:58,864
OKAY.

559
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,098
Jeff: KARA SITS DOWN.

560
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:01,366
SHE HAS THE BAG WITH THE BALL.

561
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,935
GOT TO GET ACROSS THAT FINISH.

562
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:04,536
GO.

563
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,771
Jeff: YOURE GOOD!

564
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:09,641
KARA CAN NOW MOVE ONED TO TABLE
MAZE.

565
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,576
FINALLY PURPLE IS ON THE FINAL
BEAM.

566
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,310
OKAY.

567
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,012
WE ARE AT A TRICKY PART NOW.

568
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:15,280
GO TO THE LEFT.

569
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:16,982
DO NOT DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN GO
TO THE LEFT.

570
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,117
Jeff: IT IS GREEN IN THE
LEAD ON THE MAZE.

571
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,952
ORANGE RIGHT ON THEIR TAIL.

572
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:22,120
PULL FORWARD.

573
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,923
Jeff: ANGELINA, NATALIE AND
NICK TRYING THE STAY IN IT.

574
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:25,624
WAIT.

575
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:26,458
GUYS.

576
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:28,927
IF WE CAN STAY STRAIGHT, WE GOT
THIS.

577
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,262
WHATS UNDER MY FOOT?

578
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:31,963
YOUR FOOT IS FINE.

579
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,566
Jeff: IF THEY DROP OFF THIS
BEAM, THEY HAVE TO GO BACK.

580
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,433
STOP.

581
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:36,501
STOP RIGHT HERE.

582
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,504
Jeff: ANGELINA HAS DONE A
GREAT JOB NOT GIVING UP.

583
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:43,008
GABBY CONTINUES TO PATIENTLY
LEAD CHRISTIAN AND ALISON.

584
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,376
BOTH PULL UP.

585
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:45,544
YEP.

586
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:48,513
Jeff: KARA DOING A NICE JOB
WITH ELIZABETH AND NATALIA.

587
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,447
ANGELINA HAS THE BALL.

588
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,316
SHES GOT TO GET ACROSS THAT
LAST LINE.

589
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,084
PUSH, PUSH.

590
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:53,919
PUSH, PUSH.

591
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:55,820
Jeff: YOURE GOOD.

592
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:56,321
GO!

593
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:57,289
NOW TO THE RIGHT.

594
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:58,823
Jeff: THIS IS ALL ABOUT
TRIBE COMMUNICATION.

595
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,759
GREEN CONTINUES TO MAKE GREAT
PROGRESS ON THE MAZE.

596
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,827
ORANGE RIGHT ON THEIR TAIL.

597
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:05,030
ANGELINA HAS THE BALL IN THE
MAZE.

598
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,531
PURPLE NOW CAN GET INTO IT.

599
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,900
PURPLE HAS GOT TO MAKE UP SOME
TIME QUICKLY.

600
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,536
YOURE GOING TO GO TO THE
RIGHT AND FORWARD.

601
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,006
Jeff: TEVA AND GREEN VERY
CLOSE NOW ON THIS MAZE.

602
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,308
THEYRE IN THE FINAL SECTION.

603
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:19,044
THEYVE JUST GOT TO DROP THAT
BALL IN THAT LITTLE HOLE.

604
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,178
WHERES ALISON?

605
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:22,047
WATCH OUT.

606
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,016
Jeff: ORANGE DROPS AND HAS
TO START OVER.

607
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,751
A HUGE SETBACK FOR ORANGE.

608
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:29,321
THAT IS THE BREAK PURPLE NEEDED.

609
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:31,189
IT IS NOW PURPLE IN SECOND.

610
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:33,058
IT WOULD BE AN AMAZING COMEBACK.

611
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,559
STOP, STOP.

612
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:39,364
Jeff: GABBY TRYING THE USE
THAT FINNESS, THAT FINAL MOVE IS

613
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,733
SO TOUGH ON THIS TABLE MAZE.

614
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,735
ITS THERE, ITS THERE, ITS
THERE!

615
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,371
Jeff: THERE IT IS.

616
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:47,272
TEVA PULLS IT OFF.

617
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:51,242
TEL AVIVY WINS IMMUNITY AND A
HUGE REWARD.

618
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:55,413
ONE MORE IMMUNITY UP FOR GRABS.

619
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,282
A NICE MOVE BY PURPLE.

620
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:00,752
GETS THEM WITHIN STRIKING
DISTANCE.

621
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:05,523
IT WOULD BE A HUGE WIN FOR THE
TRIBE THAT EVERYBODY THOUGHT

622
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:09,728
WERE THE UNDERDOGS TO COME OUT
AND WIN IMMUNITY OUT OF THE GATE

623
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:13,064
WOULD SEND A BIG SIGNAL THAT
THEY ARE HERE TO PLAY.

624
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,499
ANOTHER NICE MOVE BY PURPLE.

625
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:18,670
THEY ARE NOW IN THE FINAL
SECTION.

626
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:20,305
CAR CRA WITH A NICE MOVE FOR
ORANGE.

627
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,774
WE NEED TO GO RIGHT AND THEN
FORWARD.

628
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,243
PERFECT, PERFECT.

629
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,078
Jeff: IN AND OUT FOR
PURPLE.

630
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:28,713
NATALIA, GO.

631
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:29,347
PULL!

632
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:30,949
Jeff: BIG MOVE BY ORANGE.

633
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,751
NATALIA DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

634
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:33,618
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

635
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,053
Jeff: VERY CLOSE THERE.

636
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:35,920
ALL AROUND IT.

637
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:37,088
CANT GET IT TO DROP.

638
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:40,558
OPENING THE DOOR FOR ORANGE TO
SLOWLY GAIN ON THEM.

639
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:43,628
ORANGE IS NOW THROUGH TO THE
FINAL SECTION.

640
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,498
PURPLE HAS BEEN UNABLE TO CLOSE
THE DEAL, AND WE NOW HAVE A

641
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:47,165
SHOWDOWN.

642
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:48,466
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

643
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,368
Jeff: BOTH TRIBES WITH
THEIR BALL IN THE LAST SECTION

644
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:51,469
OF THE TABLE MAZE.

645
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,938
WHICH ONE WILL GET IT TO DROP
FIRST?

646
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:54,439
THROUGH.

647
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:55,707
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

648
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,608
GO TO THE RIGHTS.

649
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,109
RIGHT THERE, RIGHT THERE,
RIGHT THERE.

650
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:59,077
OH, MY GOD.

651
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,079
NATALIA, DOWN.

652
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:01,846
STOP, STOP.

653
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,280
FORWARD.

654
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:02,814
FORWARD.

655
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,549
WERE ALMOST THERE.

656
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:08,987
Jeff: PURPLE DOES IT!

657
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,857
JIBINI WINS IMMUNITY, SENDING
VUKU TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

658
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:13,324
WOW.

659
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:17,028
THAT WAS CLOSE.

660
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:23,001
YOU GUYS DID SUCH A GOOD JOB.

661
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:26,237
Jeff: TEVA, NICE WIN OUT OF
THE GATE.

662
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:26,938

663
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:29,140
BIG REWARD FOR TEVA AS WELL.

664
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:33,011
WELL BE WAITING FOR YOU BACK AT
CAMP.

665
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,313
JIBINI, CONGRATULATIONS.

666
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:37,215
JIBINI, GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD

667
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,116
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.

668
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:38,750
THANK YOU.

669
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:40,218
THANKS, JEFF.

670
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,687
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, VUKU, GRAB
YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

671
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,589
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FIFTH

672
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:48,226
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THE GAME,
YOU WILL THEN INHERIT CARL,

673
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,361
WHICH WILL BRING YOU BACK THE
FIVE MEMBERS.

674
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:54,365
THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE DIDNT
GO AS PLANNED, BUT WE HAVE THREE

675
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,102
GOLIATHS AND TWO DAVIDS.

676
00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:01,573
TONIGHTS TRIBAL COUNCIL IS
REALLY JUST PICK DAVIE OR

677
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:03,575
ELIZABETH.

678
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,021
IM SORRY, YOU GUYS.

679
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,256
ITS ALL RIGHT.

680
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,859
HONESTLY, IF I WAS CALLING,
WE WOULD HAVE STILL BEEN AT THE

681
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:21,860
FIRST PART.

682
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,194
I DONT THINK I WOULD HAVE
STAYED THAT CALM.

683
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,663
I THOUGHT WE HAD THE BEST
CHANCE OF WINNING.

684
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,732
I WAS SHOCKED THAT WE LOST.

685
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:31,136
COMING BACK FROM THE CHALLENGE,
I WAS THINKING, NOW THAT WE

686
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:34,005
LOST, ITS A 50/50 CHANCE I
COULD BE GOING HOME, SO ITS

687
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:38,476
REAL DISHEARTENING, BUT IM NOT
QUITTING YET, EVEN THOUGH IM

688
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,410
OUTNUMBERED.

689
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,112
YOURE NOT GOING TO GET RID OF
ME THAT EASY.

690
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:45,383
SO IM LIKE, GET YOU BUTT IN
GEAR AND GO TRY TO FIND THAT

691
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:52,390
IDOL.

692
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:57,328
ELIZABETH WAS LIKE, DAVID, WE
HAVE TO GO RIGHT NOW, I THINK I

693
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:58,863
KNOW WHERE THE IDOL IS.

694
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:01,666
SHE DOESNT KNOW WHERE THE IDOL,
IS BECAUSE I HAVE THE IDOL.

695
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,234
IVE HAD IT SINCE DAY FIVE.

696
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,036
THEYRE GOING TO BE UNITED.

697
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,772
I DONT TRUST THEM AS FAR AS I
CAN THROW THEM.

698
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,275
IT WOULD BE MY VOTE TO GET RID
OF NATALIA.

699
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,276
THAT WORKS FOR ME.

700
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:14,179
ELIZABETH WANTS TO TRY TO GET
RID OF NATALIA.

701
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:17,415
BUT MY GUT IS TELLING ME THOSE
THREE GOLIATHS ARE SOLID RIGHT

702
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:18,683
NOW.

703
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:22,353
LUCKILY WITH MY IDOL I DO HAVE A
SAFETY NET, BUT I DONT WANT THE

704
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,689
USE THAT THIS EARLY IN THE GAME.

705
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:32,931
I DONT KNOW, MAN, ITS
LOOKING LIKE PLAN "B."

706
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:35,300
AS SOON AS YOU GUYS WENT DOWN,
THERE SHE TOOK OFF.

707
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,536
SHES LIKE, DAVID, I GOT TO GO,
I THINK I KNOW WHERE THE IDOL

708
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,103
IS.

709
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:40,071
THERE WAS NOTHING THERE.

710
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:41,806
HE THINKS THAT ME AND HER ARE
STILL TOGETHER.

711
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,241
OUR PLAN IS FIND THE IDOL.

712
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:44,409
THATS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

713
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:48,680
PLAN "B" WAS TO VOTE YOU OUT
BECAUSE SHE DOESNT TRUST YOU.

714
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:49,480
SHES A THREAT.

715
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,448
I KNOW.

716
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:52,050
I ALREADY KNEW SHE WAS A THREAT.

717
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,719
AND I DONT WANT YOU GUYS TO
FEEL LIKE IM JUST TELLING YOU

718
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,521
ALL THIS INFORMATION BECAUSE IM
DESPERATE.

719
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:57,722
NO, NO, NO.

720
00:30:57,755 --> 00:30:59,591
IM TRYING TO WORK WITH YOU
GUYS.

721
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:00,358
ALL RIGHT.

722
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:01,459
AWESOME.

723
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:08,733
IF THERE WAS ANY DOUBT WHO
NEEDS TO GO, ITS GONE.

724
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:10,635
ELIZABETH IS A THREAT TO ME.

725
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:13,304
SHES GETTING CLOSE TO KARA, MY
ALLY.

726
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:15,573
SHES ALSO TALKING ABOUT VOTING
ME OUT.

727
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,242
SO IM LIKE, GET THIS GIRL OUT.

728
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:24,449
SHE NEEDS TO GO.

729
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:27,752
ITS TIME TO TURN THIS GAME
ON ITS HEAD.

730
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:30,722
I NEED SOMEBODY THATS SMART ON
THIS SIDE, SO IN ORDER TO WIN

731
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:33,791
THIS GAME, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A
RESUME, IF YOU CHOOSE TO STAY

732
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:37,862
WITH THE FLIETS, YOU GOT A LOT
OF MUSCLE AND A LOT OF BRAIN TO

733
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:38,196
GO THROUGH.

734
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,364
YEAH.

735
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:43,768
WITHOUT AN IDOL, I NEED TO
FLIP WAS ON THOSE GOLIATHS.

736
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:46,671
I FEEL LIKE ALEX MIGHT BE MY
BETTER OPTION.

737
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:50,608
IF YOU WERE TO VOTE OUT ONE OF
THE GOLIATHS, THAT COULD BE YOU

738
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:54,112
SAYING, HEY, I LED THAT CHARGE,
I HAD THE BALLS ENOUGH TO JUMP

739
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:54,412
SHIP.

740
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:57,015
YEAH.

741
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:01,753
ITS HARD FOR ME, BECAUSE IF
I WERE TO MAKE A MOVE AND FLIP,

742
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:04,122
THAT SAYS A LOT TO THE PEOPLE ON
THE OTHER TRIBES.

743
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:07,058
AND I KIND OF SHOW MY CARDS.

744
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:11,963
IM WILLING TO DO ANYTHING
HONESTLY.

745
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:15,466
OR EVEN IF WE JUST VOTE OUT
DAVIE.

746
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,302
SO YOU WOULD JUST PUT DAVIE.

747
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:18,269
YEAH.

748
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:22,006
ILL PUT DAVIE.

749
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,208
ALEX IS VERY CARE INFORMAL WHAT
HE SAYS OAR WHAT HE DOESNT SAY.

750
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,577
I DONT KNOW WHATS GOING ON
INSIDE HIS HEAD.

751
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:30,081
AT THIS POINT TO SAVE MY AS, IT
BECAME CLEAR I HAD THE WRITE

752
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:34,085
DAVIES NAME DOWN TONIGHT.

753
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,687
HERES WHAT I WAS THINKING
ABOUT.

754
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,091
IF WE VOTE DAVIE OUT, IM JUST
SAYING, WEIGHING OUR OPTIONS --

755
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:43,094
ITS WORSE FOR HER TO STAY IN
THE GAME.

756
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,029
SHE WOULD BE PRETENDING TO WORK
US WITH.

757
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:48,032
DAVIE, WE CAN MOLD HIM TO WORK
WITH US AND HELL BRING IN CARL

758
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:49,834
BECAUSE THEYRE ON THE OUTS,
THEY DONT HAVE ANY OTHER

759
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:50,802
PEOPLE.

760
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:51,903
NO MATTER WHAT, WE STILL HAVE
THE MAJORITY.

761
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:53,671
ITS GOOD TO THINK THROUGH
THINGS.

762
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:54,739
FOR SURE.

763
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:57,976
IN MY OPINION, DAVIE IS A
BIGGER THREAT.

764
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:01,279
BUT NATALIA, SHE HAS TO HAVE IT
HER WAY, SO I FEEL LIKE IM NOT

765
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,547
HAVING MY OPINION HEARD.

766
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,783
I JUST WANT TO KNOW, WE HAVE
EACH OTHERS TRUST, RIGHT?

767
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:06,317
YES.

768
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:07,585
DO YOU THINK OR NO?

769
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:08,653
YEAH, I AGREE.

770
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:11,923
I THINK --
 I NEED CONFIRMATION, ALEC.

771
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:13,624
I JUST FREAK OUT IF I DONT HEAR
IT.

772
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:19,130
I GET THE FEELING THAT
NATALIA DOESNT REALLY TRUST ME,

773
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,799
WHICH MAKES WORKING WITH HER
DIFFICULT.

774
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:22,934
SO I DONT KNOW.

775
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,135
ITS TOUGH.

776
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,838
DAVIE, DO YOU SWEAR YOUR WITH
US?

777
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,006
YEAH.

778
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,274
BECAUSE IF YOU DONT VOTE
WITH US, YOU HAVE NO FUTURE IN

779
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:31,109
THIS GAME.

780
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:32,510
SO YOURE GOING TO VOTE FOR HER,
RIGHT?

781
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:36,080
YEAH.

782
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:42,120
YOU TWO SHUT UP.

783
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:45,156
SHE DOESNT NEED TO BULLY
DAVIE INTO VOTING.

784
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,091
I KNOW.

785
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:50,795
SHE THINKS SHES SO SMART.

786
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:54,699
ALL THREE OF THEM TOGETHER
DONT SEEM AS TIGHT AS THEY WANT

787
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:56,434
US TO THINK THEY ARE.

788
00:33:56,467 --> 00:34:00,538
SO NOW IM WONDERING IF ALEC
MIGHT LISTEN TO ANOTHER PLAN.

789
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,573
YOU THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT
MOMENT.

790
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:06,711
, BRO?

791
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:10,148
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE.

792
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,016
ELIZABETH WANTS TO VOTE FOR
NATALIA.

793
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,820
VOTING OUT NATALIA, ITS A
BIG RISK, BUT THE THING IS,

794
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:17,188
NATALIA IS REALLY BOSSY.

795
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,756
SHES BEEN BARKING ORDERS AT
CAMP.

796
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:22,393
AND HONESTLY, ITS PISSING ME
OFF.

797
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:28,466
YOU TOTALLY TRUST THESE
GIRLS, RIGHT?

798
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:30,535
IM WITH YOU.

799
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:35,106
IS YOU GET A FUNNY FEELING
DURING TRIBAL, YOU NEED TO MAKE

800
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,774
SOME EYE CONTACT WITH ME AND LET
ME KNOW.

801
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:40,478
I HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION, DO
I STICK WITH THE NUMBERS AND GET

802
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:42,847
RID OF LICKS, OR DO I MAKE A BIG
MOVE?

803
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,716
THE THING IS IF I FLIP, CARL
WILL COME BACK AND THEN THE

804
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,652
DAVIDS WOULD HAVE THE NUMBERS.

805
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:49,687
SO I DONT KNOW.

806
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,556
ITS EXACTLY LIKE SURFING.

807
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:54,759
IF YOURE PADDLING FOR A WAVE
AND YOURE NOT FULLY COMMITTED,

808
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:57,829
YOULL PROBABLY GO OVER THE
FALLS, AND THIS COULD BLOW UP MY

809
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:59,063
ENTIRE GAME.

810
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,532
SO I GOT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IM
GOING TO DO, AND ITS GOING TO

811
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:05,570
BE SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS ON THE
SPOT AT TRIBAL.

812
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:31,896
Jeff: WELL NOW BRING IN
CARL RETURNING FROM EXILE

813
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:36,100
ISLAND.

814
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,971
CARL WILL BE LISTENING IN AND
THEN GOING BACK TO CAMP AFTER

815
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:42,640
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

816
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:44,041
SO CLOSE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

817
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,042
YOU GUYS LOST.

818
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:46,077
YOU GET BACK THE CAMP.

819
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:49,881
YOU HAVE FLEE DPLIEETHS AND ONLY
TWO DAVIDS.

820
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:53,251
NATALIA, WAS IT CLEAR IT WOULD
BE AN EASY VOTE, ITS DAVIE OR

821
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:53,618
ITS ELIZABETH.

822
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,186
EXACTLY.

823
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:57,855
OBVIOUSLY THE THREE GOLIATHS
NEEDED TO CHAT, TO SEE WHERE OUR

824
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:58,589
HEADS ARE AT.

825
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:00,291
WE DID.

826
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,126
HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU,
ELIZABETH?

827
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,327
IM CONCERNED, MAN.

828
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:06,797
I WAS ABOUT READY TO POOP MY
PANTS TODAY, NOT GOING THE LIE.

829
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,767
IM HOPING THAT THEYLL THROW ME
A BONE, BECAUSE OF MY CHARACTER

830
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:14,105
AND THE FACT THAT IM LOYAL AND
ONCE YOU GET ME ON YOUR SIDE,

831
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:15,840
IM THERE FOR THE LONG HAUL.

832
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:18,509
Jeff: DAVIE, DID YOU TRY TO
PLEAD YOUR CASE TODAY?

833
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:21,479
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY, JEFF.

834
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:25,183
LISTEN, LICKS GOT THREE KIDS,
FAMILY, SHE DIDNT COME FROM

835
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,384
MUCH.

836
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,819
SHES GOT A GOOD STORY IF SHE
MAKES IT TO THE FINAL TRIBAL.

837
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,421
SHE COULD BEAT EM ALL.

838
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:32,990
ALSO, SHES GOT A LOT OF FRIENDS
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

839
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,626
I WAS BLINDSIDED ON THE FIRST
VOTE.

840
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,963
Jeff: BOY, ELIZABETH,
DAVIES GAME IS VERY CLEAR,

841
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:41,365
THROW YOU UNDER THE BUS WITH
EVERY COMMENT THAT HE CAN.

842
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:43,634
YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

843
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:48,439
Jeff: NATALIA, HAS THE GAME
KICKED FULL IN OR ARE WE STILL

844
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:49,073
HOVERING AROUND IT?

845
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:50,441
NO, THE GAME HAS STARTED.

846
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:53,511
I MEAN, WHEN YOU HAVE A TRIBE OF
FIVE PEOPLE AND YOU LOSE, YOU

847
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,079
GOT TO START PLAYING.

848
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:58,382
AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, JEFF,
IM EXCITED TO PLAY THIS GAME.

849
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,651
IM EXCITED TO COME TO TRIBAL
AND EXPERIENCE EVERYTHING THAT I

850
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:01,786
CAN.

851
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:05,323
I MEAN, IF I GO HOME TONIGHT,
GUNS ABLAZING, IM HAPPY.

852
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:08,593
Jeff: ELIZABETH, THAT IS
THE MARK OF THE MODERN

853
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:11,862
"SURVIVOR" PLAYER, WHICH IS IF I
GO DOWN, I WANT TO BURN OUT

854
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,164
RATHER THAN FADE AWAY.

855
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:15,433
Jeff: YEAH, YOU GOT TO
START PLAYING THE WIN FROM THE

856
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,568
MOMENT YOU FIRST GET YOUR BUFF.

857
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:18,769
THAT INCLUDES TONIGHT.

858
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:24,175
YOU GOT TO BE WILLING TO HAVE
SOME BALLS AND MAKE BIG MOVES.

859
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:27,778
YOU CANT JUST MAKE THE SIMPLE,
EASY MOVES AND HAVE A RESUME AT

860
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,180
THE END OF THE GAME.

861
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:32,350
Jeff: NATALIA, THAT IS THE
BEST THING ELIZABETH COULD EVER

862
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:36,821
SAY IN THIS SITUATION AT TRIBAL
IS TO PUSH THE BIG MOVE AND SAY

863
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:38,789
ONE OF YOU GUYS SHOULD DO
SOMETHING.

864
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:42,994
ELIZABETH, NOT GOING THE LIE,
IS DESPERATE, BUT HOW THE ONE

865
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,428
"SURVIVOR" IS MAKING BIG MOVES.

866
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:46,330
ITS JUST DECIDING WHEN TO MAKE
THOSE WIG MOVES.

867
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:49,567
AND YOU CAN WAIT UNTIL ITS
TOO LATE AND FIGURE OUT LATER, I

868
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,935
SHOULD HAVE MADE A MOVE THEN.

869
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:55,706
I THINK TONIGHT WILL BE A HUGE
DETERMINING FACTOR IN WHO WILL

870
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:05,783
BE SITTING AT THAT FINAL TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

871
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:12,023
BE SITTING AT THAT FINAL TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

872
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:18,429
Jeff: NATALIA, WHAT DO YOU
MAKE OF THIS?

873
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:21,198
I DONT LIKE THAT AT ALL.

874
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:24,802
IM JUST MAKING SURE
EVERYONES ON THE SAME PAGE.

875
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:28,572
NO.

876
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:29,740
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

877
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:32,843
I THINK ITS UNEASY BECAUSE
WE HAD A PLAN GOING INTO IT.

878
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:36,113
WE HAD A PLAN, AND HIM DOING
THAT IS TOTALLY NOTHING TO DO

879
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,381
WITH THE PLAN.

880
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,017
I TRUST HIM.

881
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:43,587
IM GOOD.

882
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:46,891
Jeff: NATALIA, ITS AS IF
YOURE PROCESSING IT BEHIND YOUR

883
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:48,125
EYES.

884
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,528
IS THAT TENSION NEAR TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS COULD MEAN.

885
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:51,796
YES, IT IS.

886
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,332
IM NOT OKAY WITH WHAT HAPPENED
RIGHT NOW.

887
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:58,469
ITS THE SAME THING, RIGHT?

888
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:08,346
YES.

889
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:09,914
Jeff: DAVIE, NOBODY TALKED
TO YOU.

890
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:11,415
NO ONE TALKED TO ME.

891
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:14,318
I DONT KNOW IF THATS A GOOD
THING OR A BAD THING.

892
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,254
BUT I GUESS WERE ABOUT TO SEE.

893
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:18,622
Jeff: ELIZABETH, THIS IS
"SURVIVOR."

894
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,458
SURE ENOUGH IS.

895
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:21,859
Jeff: THIS IS WHAT YOU
DREAM ABOUT.

896
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:25,262
WHEN YOURE SITTING ON THE
COUCH, ITS EXCITING TO WATCH.

897
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:30,568
WHEN YOURE SITTING RIGHT HERE,
ITS NOT SO MUCH EXCITING, ITS

898
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:31,235
LIKE --.

899
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:32,103
Jeff: REASSURING GOING ON.

900
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:35,339
LETS GO.

901
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:35,840
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

902
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:39,844
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

903
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:44,348
NATALIA, YOURE UP.

904
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:49,019
IM JUST GOING TO BE REAL
WITH YOU.

905
00:39:49,053 --> 00:40:00,131
I DONT TRUST YOU AND I DONT
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

906
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,967
I REALLY DONT KNOW WHAT JUST
HAPPENED.

907
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:12,376
SO SORRY.

908
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:31,195
Jeff: IM GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

909
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:35,232
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

910
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:41,205
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

911
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:42,173
OKAY.

912
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:43,574
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.

913
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,010
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

914
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:47,278
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

915
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:51,882
ILL READ THE VOTES.

THATS ONE VOTE ELIZABETH, ONE

THATS TWO VOTES NATALIA, ONE

00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,841

NATALIA.

925
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:28,319
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

926
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:29,720
I KNEW IT.

927
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:38,128
I KNEW I COULDNT TRUST YOU.

928
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,063
IM SORRY.

929
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:40,464
DONT BE SORRY.

930
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,233
SHUT UP.

931
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:49,473
WHERE DO I PUT THIS?

932
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,142
Jeff: NATALIA, THE TRIBE
HAS SPOKEN.

933
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,177
DID YOU KNOW?

934
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,445
ME?

935
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:57,882
NO.

936
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:59,316
WHY ARE YOU SMILING?

937
00:41:59,350 --> 00:41:59,984
OH, MY GOD.

938
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,019
I CANT HANDLE YOU RIGHT NOW.

939
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:11,061
ITS A GAME.

940
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:13,497
Jeff: WELL, IT DOESNT
MATTER THE NUMBER OF DAYS INTO

941
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:17,568
THE GAME OR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE
ON A TRIBE, THERES ALWAYS AN

942
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:20,004
OPPORTUNITY FOR A BIG MOVE.

943
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,705
GRAB YOUR TORCH, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

944
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,440
CARL, A BUFF WILL BE WAITING FOR
YOU BECOME AT CAMP.

945

949
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:37,922
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

950
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:45,329
Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," THERES NOWHERE TO

951
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:45,796
RUN.

952
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,197
I TRUST MY GUT.

953
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,465
ALEX MIND SIDED ME.

954
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:50,200
THIS WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

955
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,135
Jeff: NOWHERE TO HIDE.

956
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,971
SHE HAS A MASTERS IN
UNGRACIOUSNESS.

957
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:56,440
IM READY FOR SURVIVOR
WITHOUT NATALIE.

958
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:58,475
Jeff: BECAUSE THE STORM IS
COMING.

959
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:02,112
THATS THE GOLIATH.

960
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:07,117
IM JUST UPSET BECAUSE I KNEW
THE SECOND WE GOT TO THIS TRIBE

961
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:08,319
THERE WAS A SHIFT IN ALEC.

962
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:11,355
I SHOULD HAVE WENT WITH MY GUT
AND I DID NOT GO WITH MY GUT.

963
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:13,424
I THINK I SHOULD HAVE MADE A BIG
MOVE AND CONTINUOUSLY MAKE A BIG

964
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:17,061
MOVE AND I PLAYED A STUPID GAME
TONIGHT.

965
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:20,130
IM JUST PISSED.

966
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:22,866
I WANT TO HURT HIM SO BAD.
