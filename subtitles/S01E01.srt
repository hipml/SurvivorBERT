<i>From this tiny,</i>
<i>Malaysian fishing village,</i>

00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:09,718
<i>these 16 Americans are</i>
<i>beginning the adventure</i>

3
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,261
<i>of a lifetime.</i>

4
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:22,605
<i>They have volunteered</i>
<i>to be marooned for 39 days</i>

5
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,649
<i>on mysterious Borneo.</i>

6
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,279
<i>This is their story.</i>

7
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,240
<i>This is</i> Survivor.

00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:33,510
Are we getting two of these?

10
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,846
Where's that box?

11
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,849
JEFF:
You are witnessing 16 Americans
begin an adventure

12
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,559
that will forever change
their lives.

13
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,521
They've been given two minutes
to salvage whatever they can

14
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,814
off this boat.

15
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,319
Their destination:
this island right here,

16
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,196
<i>a beautiful,</i>
<i>but dangerous jungle</i>

17
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,990
<i>in the middle</i>
<i>in the South China Sea.</i>

18
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,575
Who's got oars?!

19
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,036
Oh, we got our lifejackets.

20
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,663
For the next 39 days,
they'll be marooned,

21
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:02,872
left to fend for themselves,

22
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:03,540
no creature comforts.

23
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,376
They are wiping the slate clean.

24
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,546
Grab it!

25
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,047
16 strangers forced
to band together

26
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,549
to carve out a new existence,

27
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,717
totally accountable
for their actions.

28
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,219
They must learn to adapt,
or they're voted off.

29
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:21,599
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>only one will remain</i>

30
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,892
and will leave the island

31
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,686
with $1 million in cash
as their reward.

32
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,437
Go, go, go!

33
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:30,400
<i>39 days, 16 people,</i>
<i>one survivor.</i>

34
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,777
Grab it!
Hey, behind you!

35
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,112
Get off the raft!

36
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,280
Get off the other side!

37
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,156
Get off the raft!

38
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,909
The rod, Sean!

39
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:40,910
Listen up!

40
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,912
Grab your backpacks!

41
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:43,913
Put them on!

42
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,914
Go! Let's do it!

43
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:45,957
Whoo!

44
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,419
Here we go!

45
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,132

46
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:57,760
<i>The 16 contestants have been</i>

(<i> shouting orders</i>

73
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,854
Hard to imagine
that just four hours ago,

74
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,690
this group met
for the first time

75
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,526
in a small fishing village
on the coast of Borneo.

76
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,528
<i>Their minds racing</i>
<i>with questions,</i>

77
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,114
<i>wondering, "Can I do this?"</i>

78
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:47,870
<i>This is more than just a test</i>
<i>of survival skills.</i>

79
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,998
<i>It's also a test</i>
<i>of social skills.</i>

80
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,376
<i>Here, it's the impressions</i>
<i>you make on the other castaways</i>

81
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,837
<i>that determines your fate.</i>

82
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,840
<i>Under the rules, one tribe</i>

83
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,008

84
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:04,512
<i>vote one of their own members</i>
<i>off the island.</i>

85
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:07,056

<i>survive the vote,</i>

87
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,019
<i>and, ultimately,</i>
<i>survive each other.</i>

88
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,520
Whoo!

89
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,438
I'm giving you
a degree--

90
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,190
a university
honorary degree.

91
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,276
Whoo!

92
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,444
Damn, when you
guys get up,

93
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:20,945
now the whole
thing goes...

94
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,530
Whoa! Watch out!

95
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,033
Here we go.

96
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,577
We got a great view
of Snake Island!

97
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,245
Get to work.

98
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:31,247
We got oars.
We got buckets.

99
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,124
We're set for months.

100
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,418
Hey, who knows, we could make
a mud house with it.

101
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,421
You know,
that could be like rebar.

102
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,049
RUDY:
<i>Paddling over, we had two</i>
<i>or three of those boxes</i>

103
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:41,716
<i>in the water,</i>

104
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:45,261
dragging them behind the raft

105
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,721
and that is dumb.

106
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,765
I said,
"Let's get them boxes aboard.

107
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,682
It'll be a lot easier."

108
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,435
You know,
"That's deadweight you got."

109
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,437
KELLY:
<i>He was yelling at everybody</i>

110
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,147
<i>"Let's lose the box!</i>

111
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,107
<i>Cut it loose now!"</i>

112
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,610
He may be 72 years old
and an ex-Navy SEAL,

113
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,446
but that doesn't mean
that this is his world.

114
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,573
RICHARD:
Rudy, Sean, Stacey, Sue,
can we take 15 minutes

115
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,743
and just talk before
we do anything?

116
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,078
Sure.

117
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:10,578
Can we piss first?

118
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,663
Just a suggestion.

119
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:20,463
Should we take
a break?

120
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,632
No, keep paddling!

121
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,634
One break at a time!

122
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,636
One water break at a time.

123
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,596
We want to get closer
to the island

124
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,639
before we turn up.

125
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,681
I'll distill you
all the water you want,

126
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,184
just get me
to the island.

127
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,436
You guys, we are so close.

128
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,105
Keep going,
we're there.

129
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,773
(<i> retching noise</i> )

130
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,109
You all right?

131
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,819
We're almost there,
Roe, hang in.

132
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,820
Okay.

133
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:44,654
Got it going
right over here.

134
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,115
Where'd he point?f us.

135
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,158
Right there.
Straight up there.

136
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,207
Whoo!
And we're all here.

137
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,917
Let's go.

138
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:00,545
Yeah!

139
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:04,132
Whoo-hoo!

140
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,842
This is what I was
talking about!

141
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:12,014
Ramona, how you
doing, honey?

142
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:17,812
RAMONA:
<i>I don't like being on the water</i>
<i>all that much.</i>

143
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,564
So, I mean, the whole motion
like this,

144
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,858
and we're rowing,

145
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,527
and we have like 100 pounds
of stuff on the raft,

146
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,863
I just, I started heaving.

147
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,823
Good job.
Good job.

148
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:32,493
RAMONA:
<i>I'm used to being in a lab</i>
<i>with my lab coat on,</i>

149
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,704
<i>in the air-conditioning.</i>

150
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:38,166
But this is, like, outdoors,
24-7,

151
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:42,628
and you're exerting energy,
like, almost all of that time.

152
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,590
Oh, my God.

153
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,634
This is just Day One.

154
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,726
Should we, uh, you know,
talk for a little bit,

155
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:57,602
or should we start moving
stuff up?

156
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,854
Hey, let's discuss some things,
man.

157
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,272
Let's figure some things out.

158
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,732
Here's what we
plan on doing.

159
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,692
High tide is that
line right there,
see that line?

160
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:05,693
Yeah, uh-huh.

161
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:06,611
So it shouldn't
come up to here.

162
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,738
And this piece of
bamboo back here,

163
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,698
we can lay it from up here,
over to there,

164
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,909
and that'll be the beginning
of our shelter.

165
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:13,743
Actually, before
we build a shelter,

166
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,412
just knock that
whole branch off.

167
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:18,206
No, I mean, this
is an awesome spot.

168
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,540
I'm just saying...

169
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,500
What's the first thing
we need to do?

170
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,793
We need a latrine.

171
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,754
Okay, so we don't need
fire tonight?

172
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,130
That's an option.

173
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,882
We got enough water
to make it tonight.

174
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,092
You guys, I think first
thing we ought to do

175
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,094
is talk about how
we're going to do

176
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,596
whatever
we're going to do--

177
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,097
talk about the process.

178
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,557
Listen, listen.

179
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,975
Let me give you
a rough quick.

180
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:38,726
The camp will be
right there.

181
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,895
We'll clear these leaves off.

182
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,396
That's a flat piece of ground.

183
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,773
The latrine will be down there.

184
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,900
The wind's hitting me
in the back right now.

185
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,152
SEAN:
So, we're saying
we need a latrine

186
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,112
and a clear place
to sleep, is that all?

187
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,489
Food.

188
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,990
And if we need
more...

189
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,951
Let's check the box,
before we make
any decisions.

190
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,244
Let's see what we got.

191
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,955
There might be a
blowtorch in there.

192
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,122
We need a bathroom.

193
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,958
Are you guys
all done talking?

194
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,292
Huh?

195
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,336
I don't know.

196
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,462
I'm done.

197
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:07,630
I'm going to open
up a box.

198
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,131
I'm looking
for Fritos.

199
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,467
DIRK:
<i>Rich, um, I appreciate</i>
<i>what he's trying to do</i>

200
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,344
<i>as far as bring the team</i>
<i>together and stuff,</i>

201
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,346
'cause that's one thing
that needs to happen.

202
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,348
I think he's got some good
skills in that area.

203
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,141
And, unfortunately,
people like that annoy me.

204
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,643
I'm just thinking,

205
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,144
I think we're off
to a bad start.

206
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,688
Why, 'cause
we're not talking?

207
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:24,730
Yeah.

208
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,816
Sometimes, though,
Richard, um,

209
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:27,817
you kind of got
to do things

210
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,278
and talk
as you go along,

211
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:33,489
and sometimes things
can't be that planned out.

212
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:34,782
I agree with you.

213
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,493
The problem with having
no conversation whatsoever,

214
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:39,829
or lots of people talking
about different things

215
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,665
is that nobody's working
toward a particular goal.

216
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,166
Not the silly
little stuff about,

217
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,835
oh, who's going
to sleep where?

218
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:46,877
What are we
going to do?

219
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:47,878
But why are we here?

220
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,213
And what's the point?

221
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,381
And if we don't...

222
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,800
Oh, I figured that out
before I come here.

223
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:53,676
And you haven't?

224
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,012
And I have for me,

225
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,513
but we haven't for us.

226
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:59,348
And for the next
seven ejections,

227
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,600
21 days, we have
to function together,

228
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,351
or we fail.

229
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,520
What do you think
we're doing now?

230
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:05,855
Not functioning
together at all.

231
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,649
I'm a redneck, and I don't know
corporate world at all,

232
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,526
and corporate world
ain't gonna work out here

233
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:11,319
in the bush.

234
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,362
No, I'm not talking
corporate world.

235
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,030
I'm talking
creating a team.

236
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,198
I thought we were doing good.

237
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,283
But, see, creating a team

238
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,536
is actually putting
all of our hands together...

239
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,371
Not hands, all of us knowing
what we're doing.

240
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,914
Yeah, the hand thing,
yeah, but that's...

241
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:24,874
Action, man. Action, Richard.

242
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,209
Action.

243
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,879
Well, you don't want
to act ahead.

244
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,382
RICHARD:
<i>I'm good to go survivalwise.</i>

245
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,718
<i>Peoplewise, it'll be</i>
<i>a little more challenging.</i>

246
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,887
<i>But I've got the million dollar</i>
<i>check written already.</i>

247
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,389
<i>I mean, I'm the winner.</i>

248
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,892
And it's that kind of cocky
attitude that makes people

249
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,602
really hate your guts.

250
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,854
So that's the kind of thing,
I've really got to keep, uh...

251
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,357
under wraps.

252
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,694
<i>But, uh, it's just,</i>
<i>how do I get there from here?</i>

253
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,871
What's that?

254
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,206
Whoa! Look at this, folks.

255
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,834
If this is kerosene,
and we didn't take
one of those lamps...

256
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,879
We can make torches
and stuff out of twine.

257
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:12,963
We could twine all
the rafts together.

258
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,757
JOEL:
What is that?

259
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,883
Biscuits.

260
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,593
Yeah, it's
definitely biscuits,

261
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,386
'cause we got corn...

262
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,262
Well, look, we
got a frying pan.

263
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,305
Oh, we are so set.

264
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,390
Look, I'm shaking it.

265
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,933
Can anyone hear
the biscuits?

266
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,601
Oh, ho, we got
a team flag.

267
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,103
Whoo-hoo!

268
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,437
If that's our latrine,

269
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,438
I say we
dig a hole,

270
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,231
put this here,
knock a board

271
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,274
out of the bottom,
then we can keep

272
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,275
moving it across.

273
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,985
Let's plug the hole.

274
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,238
SEAN:
Let's sit down and talk
about what the hell

275
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,280
we're going to do.

276
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,323
RICHARD:
Can I help?

277
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,742
When I asked earlier
about having a conversation,

278
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,411
that's what I was talking about,

279
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,663
and I really can help
with how we can do this.

280
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,497
We wanted to see...

281
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,416
You guys, we came over here
to talk.

282
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,959
We just want
to see what we...

283
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,128
RICHARD:
<i>What happens when</i>
<i>people get together is</i>

284
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,630
if they aren't all
headed in the same direction,

285
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:58,592
toward a particular goal,
then things that individuals do

286
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:02,096
kind of get in the way
of the whole team, and I think

287
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,974
it's really, really important
that what we decide

288
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,600
be decided as a group.

289
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,935
So, if you hear somebody
saying something

290
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,479
and you're all aggravated
with them, stop,

291
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,313
don't try to make your point

292
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,982
and try and help them
make theirs.

293
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,109
So, for example,
you know, Sean,

294
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,986
what do you think
a main point

295
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,946
of what I'm trying
to say now is?

296
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,781
I didn't listen to a word you...

297
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,325
I've been daydreaming, thinking,
"What am I going to eat?"

298
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,327
Well, you'll
begin to figure
that out...

299
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,597
All right, we
got a stick up.

300
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,100
Well, as long as they can
hit the middle of this hole,

301
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,894
we're all set here.

302
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,020
Put it right like this.

303
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,104
This is perfect.

304
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,363
Hey, we found a water map!

305
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,656
You got it?

306
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,365
We got a water map.

307
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,659
B.B.:
"Enter jungle here."

308
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,077
"Walk 375 paces

309
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,371
along..."

310
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,539
Oh, we start here.

311
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,167
We go back
to the other stream down there

312
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,544
and then we get
the water here.

313
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,004
B.B.:
<i>Here's where we are right here.</i>

314
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,715
We have to go
across the stream.

315
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,383
We go across one stream...

316
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,928
two streams,
three streams.
Two streams,
three streams.

317
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,429
All right.

318
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,431
All right,
we're ready to roll.

319
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,516
All right.

320
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,477
You all right?

321
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,564
Okay, is this the path?

322
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,941
Well, it said
"newly cut path."

323
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,526
It looks
newly cut, but...

324
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,610
"trail washes out."

325
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,070
Oh, the trail
washes out.

326
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,279
Oh, wa...?

327
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,907
No?

328
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,743
B.B.:
<i>Why don't you stay there</i>
<i>for a minute?</i>

329
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:48,410
<i>Let me walk</i>

330
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,078
and keep you
in sight...

331
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,120
Okay.

332
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,039
...to see if I see...

333
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,707
Anything?

334
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,418
...anything
that resembles anything.

335
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,379
(<i> sighs</i> )

336
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:58,921
Do you see anything?

337
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,382
Huh?

338
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:05,052
Look here.

339
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,595
I mean, come here
and look at it.

340
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,264
Okay, ready?

341
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,266
Oh, thank you,
Jesus.

342
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,308
Christ!

343
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,309
Yeah.

344
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,769
There we are.
Go ahead.

345
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:14,770
All right.

346
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:17,064
Way to go, B.B.

347
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,149
Don't let me drop
sweat in there.

348
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,235
Okay, it's almost full.

349
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,820
You know, we could
never do this,

350
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:23,946
but you know what
thought crossed my mind?

351
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,448
What?

352
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,450
As long as you
and I always know
where the water is

353
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,493
and we got control
of the water map,

354
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,954
no one else will
be able to vote
you or I out.

355
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,163
We're not giving up
the secret...

356
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,623
We're not giving
up the secret.

357
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,833
...of the water supply.

358
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:36,959
That's right!

359
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,135
(<i> all chuckling</i> )

360
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,138
And your wife
is how old now?

361
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,306
B.B.:
My wife?
Right now?

362
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,307
Yeah.

363
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,308
She's 45.

364
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,809
Wow. And how old are you?

365
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:54,393
64.

366
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:54,977
Oh, you better go.

367
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,103
You are a stud.

368
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,104
He's a stud!

369
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,148
His name's Viagra.

370
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,651
Viagra. That's his nickname.

371
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,986
Dang!

372
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,280
You know, you got to do
what you got to do, right?

373
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,198
Somebody has to do
the dirty work.

374
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:12,620
If we don't keep some humor...
we'll go mad.

375
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,001
Good night, y'all.

376
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,127
Good night.

377
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,378
Good night.

378
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,869
Stretch out.

379
00:15:53,952 --> 00:15:55,329
RUDY:
<i>The hardest part</i>

380
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,081
<i>is hanging around</i>
<i>with all these young kids.</i>

381
00:15:57,164 --> 00:16:00,376
I don't even know
what MTV means, you know?

382
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,045
<i>And I'm used to being</i>
<i>in the military</i>

383
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,089
<i>and one guy stands up,</i>
<i>he gives an order</i>

384
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,924
<i>and there's no back talk.</i>

385
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,717
You know, like yesterday,

386
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,302
everybody's trying
to run the show

387
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,262
and if they'd let
one person do it,

388
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:15,015
we'd be much better off.

389
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,893
But trying to keep them all
shut up is hard.

390
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:19,395
<i>If they listen to me,</i>

391
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,063
<i>they'd all have haircuts</i>
<i>and everything else, you know.</i>

392
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,315
<i>We'd be in formation</i>
<i>in the morning</i>

393
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,275
<i>and all that kind of stuff,</i>

394
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,320
<i>but they're not</i>
<i>going to do that.</i>

395
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,406
<i>I got to fit in, not them.</i>

396
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,700
You know, there's more of them
than there is of me.

397
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,993
Hey, you got
a pierced nipple, eh?

398
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,246
Yeah. I got the ol'
pierced nipple thing.

399
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,497
How did that feel?

400
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,457
Pretty edgy for
a doctor, right?

401
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,084
Yeah, yeah.

402
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,377
I thought I was making it
with the hair

403
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,378
and then this morning,

404
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,504
when I ran my hand through it

405
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:49,133
and felt these couple
of golf ball-sized knots in it,

406
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,385
I'm like, no, they got
to come out now.

407
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,598
SONJA:
I was doing something.

408
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,100
I don't even remember
how I did it.

409
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,436
Betadine won't hurt it,
yeah, so we'll give it

410
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,603
a little shot of Betadine.

411
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,731
I think these are
the only sponges we have,

412
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,649
so I'm just going
to keep reusing them.

413
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,443
Okay.

414
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,445
SONJA:
<i>I've been thrashing around</i>
<i>like I'm 35,</i>

415
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,780
<i>instead of acting my age,</i>

416
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,449
<i>but we have a doctor</i>

417
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:17,327
in our tribe-- uh, Sean--
and he did a wonderful job

418
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,455
<i>of bandaging me up.</i>

419
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,832
<i>I think one of the problems</i>
<i>with aging</i>

420
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,126
<i>is the thinning of the skin,</i>
<i>darn it,</i>

421
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,754
and so I think I'm maybe
getting a little more banged up

422
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,964
than some of the younger ones.

423
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,468
My aim leaves something
to be desired,

424
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,469
but we're getting there.

425
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,303
Try this?

426
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,305
Well, I don't know.

427
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,307
This is heavier.

428
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,767
It might be
sharper, though.

429
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:40,684
Think so?

430
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,270
I'm wondering 'cause
that's so damn hard.

431
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,271
Well, that's off.

432
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,856
That ain't gonna work.

433
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:49,151
Here's a, uh, a therapist's
version of "Bye, Bye, Blues,"

434
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,694
if I can remember it.

Fantastic.

446
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,193
RICHARD:
<i>Well, the fish traps</i>
<i>were hanging from the boat</i>

447
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,821
<i>that we were coming over here,</i>

448
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,322
<i>and when we were</i>
<i>tossed into the sea on the raft</i>

449
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:38,700
<i>and we could take whatever</i>
<i>we could get our hands on,</i>

450
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,327
<i>we grabbed</i>
<i>three or four fish traps</i>

451
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,912
<i>and a bunch of rat traps,</i>

452
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,122
and so we stuck the rat traps
out the first night

453
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,707
and boom-- we got a rat
in each of them.

454
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,378
Bait. I want bait!

455
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,255
Give me bait!

456
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,429
I think he's just going
to cut its head off.

457
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,683
Ew!

458
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:03,725
Oh, God!

459
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,561
Oh, no way!

460
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,355
(<i> laughing</i> )

461
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,398
Remember that knife.

462
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,650
We're not using it
for anything else.

463
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,361
Oh, dude!

464
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,323
RAMONA:
<i>I didn't sleep at all.</i>

465
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,243
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>we-we closed our eyes.</i>

466
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,703
<i>We kept hearing noises</i>

467
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,914
and, like, clicking sounds,
and we're, like, okay.

468
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:26,373
Um, what's his name...

469
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,792
WOMAN::
Joel.

470
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,545
Uh, Joel woke up,
a rat was, like, in his ear.

471
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,422
JOEL:
<i>I heard something squeaking</i>
<i>in my ear.</i>

472
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,965
<i>A rat was trying</i>
<i>to get on the raft,</i>

473
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,592
or get near us
or get at something.

474
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,843
I mean, everything was moving.

475
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:42,389
B.B.:
<i>We're just going</i>
<i>along the beach here</i>

476
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,766
<i>and just identifying</i>
<i>whatever we can use</i>

477
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,768
<i>for the shelter, the roof.</i>

478
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,396
<i>And I'm a little irritated</i>

479
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,981
that none of the others

480
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,317
are down here to help
carry stuff, but that's okay.

481
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,445
We need...
we need five more of these.

482
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,906
B.B....

483
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,616
He's a character, man.

484
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,326
I don't think he likes me much.

485
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,453
Just these.

486
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,954
No, no,
you don't understand.

487
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,082
I got to have this thought out
and positioned right.

488
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,459
GRETCHEN:
He's right, Joel,

489
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,543
or it's not going
to fit the frame.

490
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,502
Joel, trust me.

491
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,963
I'm not the
one bitching.

492
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,131
I mean, I'm fine.

493
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:19,635
Hey, don't be
talking to me

494
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,469
about monkey
business.

495
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,638
I can't sleep,
so I'm usually up.

496
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,808
...this being the width.

497
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,831
B.B.:
<i>We got a lot of lazy people</i>

498
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,291
if you want to know the truth.

499
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,459
You can't do it all yourself.

500
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,379
You know, I asked Colleen
to straighten this out for me

501
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,798
and here it is.

502
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,967
<i>That's the only thing</i>
<i>she had to do today.</i>

503
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,094
You can't have lazy people.

504
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,513
GRETCHEN:
<i>He had been out there,</i>
<i>you know, all morning long</i>

505
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,849
and, um... you know,
it was hot.

506
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,687
GRETCHEN:
B.B., I thought we said
that this was a time of day,

507
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,814
we were going to be
out of the sun.

508
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:16,191
Well, but for some of us...
some of the people,

509
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:17,526
it's been all day that way.

510
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,152
Right,
it's your turn.

511
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,529
You tell me
what you're doing here

512
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,698
and I'll help you.

513
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,699
You hold it up

514
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:24,741
and I'll do it quick.

515
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,410
I promise you,
I'll do it quick.

516
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,036
That, you know,

517
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,870
that's the right
way to do it,

518
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,956
but we won't have
near enough line

519
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,165
to build the roof
and do that

520
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,166
if we do all this,

521
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,418
in all fairness.

522
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,212
Anyway, don't
stop now, but...

523
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:38,547
I think we'll have plenty,

524
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:43,260
and I'm going to roll that up
for you, too.

525
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,220
We can't, like,
get burned out, though.

526
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:46,221
I'm not burned out.

527
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:47,014
I know,
but you will be

528
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,016
if you spend all day
out in the sun.

529
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:49,516
No, I never
get burned out.

530
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,559
You don't know me.

531
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,228
I don't know you,
but I know human beings.

532
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:53,937
Okay.

533
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:54,855
I like working
as a hobby.

534
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,440
Honest to God,
how about 15 minutes though?

535
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,566
Sit down for 15 minutes.

536
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,027
Why? Yeah, but,
I want to get...

537
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,237
I want to get this thing
stabilized so at least...

538
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,947
But, B.B., look...

539
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,240
Let me just explain.

540
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:08,785
I want to get this stabilized so
then people can come in here...

541
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,579
You know the light cords
you got?

542
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,247
And we can tie
these things down,

543
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,374
but until I get this bounce
out of this...

544
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,585
I want to... I'm going to put
a support there

545
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,588
in the middle here
and right there.

546
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,548
'Cause if not, we
got to take bounce
out of this.

547
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:24,134
I just think we have
plenty of time.

548
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,635
I thought we were going
to try to stay competitive,

549
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,636
and if you work all day

550
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,930
and you're burnt
at the end of the day,

551
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,015
we're not going to be
competitive.

552
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,100
Take a break, and if it bounces
a little tonight,

553
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,227
then we'll fix it tomorrow.

554
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,229
I'm going to keep working,
sweetheart.

555
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,230
You're going to get
burned out.

556
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,231
No, I'm not.

557
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,232
Yeah, you are.

558
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,233
You already are.

559
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,331
B.B.:
Oh, my.

560
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:01,880
You're doing fine.

561
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:02,506
Too much paper.

562
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,674
Yeah.

563
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,302
Bifocals work?

564
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,304
Bifocals worked.

565
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:09,971
You the man, B.

566
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,307
No, she took
my bifocals...

567
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,642
We're both the man.

568
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,102
And made it happen.

569
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,145
B.B.:
<i>And the fire started</i>

570
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,482
<i>because I had bought</i>
<i>a set of glasses with me.</i>

571
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,150
I was going to do it

572
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,111
and Gretchen said,
"Why don't I do it?

573
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,154
I know how to do it, too."
So, I said, "Great."

574
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,989
Nice, guys. You guys
split up and everything.

575
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,324
Good work.

576
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:29,991
B.B.:
<i>And she took my glasses</i>

577
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,619
<i>and started the fire.</i>

578
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,079
<i>You did well, Gretch.</i>

579
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,209
If we get fire,

580
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:42,462
it means we're going to have
a hot meal in our stomach

581
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,630
which is going to bring up
team morale.

582
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:46,299
That first meal
might be rat soup,

583
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,718
which I'm, like,
looking forward to very much

584
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,179
because there's nothing wrong
with a rat.

585
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,890
All a rat is, is a squirrel
without a fuzzy tail.

586
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,517
Let's just work with this.

587
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,018
Okay.

588
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,687
I'm thinking,
if we could work with this,

589
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,814
we're getting
a ton of smoke.

590
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:03,233
Start that
If we get a piece of bamboo,

591
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,360
someone sits here and holds
the bamboo right here

592
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:06,528
With the kindling
in it.he kindling in it.

593
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,655
You know what I'm saying?

594
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,282
Here we go.

595
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,290
Come on, Dirk.

596
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,376
Go big.

597
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:24,129
This isn't
going to catch.

598
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,592
Well, you want
to just keep trying?

599
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,760
Why don't we try
and make the bough?

600
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,888
MAN:
Go...!

601
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,222
Come on!
We're getting there!

602
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,724
All right! Okay!

603
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,726
Don't stop!
Don't stop!

604
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,103
There was smoke.
We lost it.

605
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,188
Yeah. of smoke.

606
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,189
Don't you guys...

607
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,566
Cool!

608
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:45,567
How much more do we need?

609
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:45,984
I don't know.

610
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:46,610
How much more?

611
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:47,611
That'll do it.

612
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:48,737
You in, Rich?

613
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,531
Here we go.
Here we go.

614
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:52,574
Work it, Rich.

615
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,700
Yeah.

616
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,701
What?

617
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:58,246
You guys get ready
to take his spot.

618
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:58,955
Take a break, man.

619
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,750
We made a lot smoke but no fire.

620
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,211
<i>I think it would have been nice</i>
<i>if we had fire,</i>

621
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:04,961
<i>but we're not going</i>
<i>to catch fish</i>

622
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,589
<i>unless we have fire to cook it</i>

623
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,882
<i>and I think that</i>
<i>if we had fire,</i>

624
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,551
<i>we could have spent</i>
<i>a lot of time sitting</i>

625
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,470
around the bonfire
at night maybe singing songs.

626
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:14,888
We have a ukulele, you know,

627
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:15,764
and that didn't happen
and I wish it did.

628
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,725
Throughout their time
on the island,

629
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:21,770
the tribes will compete
in a series of challenges.

630
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,563
They'll receive messages

631
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,607
notifying them
of these competitions

632
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,108
at their tree mail.

633
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,486
Today's challenge is
for both reward,

634
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,739
in the form of 50 waterproof
matches, and immunity.

635
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,784
Win immunity, you stay
on the island a few days longer.

636
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,411
Lose, face Tribal Council,

637
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,623
where you must vote one member
off the island.

638
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,675
Ooh.

639
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,970
A map to fire.

640
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,596
It's got to be.

641
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,931
"Cold food, dark camp,

642
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:00,600
"just a reminder
of your first night.

643
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,936
It looks so easy
in the book." Yes.

644
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,980
"Why is it so hard to light?

645
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,315
"Tonight your tribe
will carry the torch.

646
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,775
"One tribe takes
home the flame.

647
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:12,570
The other gives
someone the boot."

648
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,697
Whoa!

649
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,156
Whoa.

650
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,783
I guess they're
combining the reward

651
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,451
and immunity challenge
this time.

652
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,453
That's the competition
is taking home the flame,

653
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,871
but what's the competition?
We've got no freakin' idea.

654
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:38,179
Welcome, tribes,
to your first challenge.

655
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,181
Congratulations
on your first night

656
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,350
on the island--
should be very proud.

657
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,352
I know both of
you guys have food.

658
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,271
You found some
fresh water

659
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,732
and I think, Pagong,
you guys had fire.

660
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:49,774
(<i> cheers</i> )

661
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:50,859
Right on.

662
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,027
A lot of work to get fire.

663
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,028
Yeah.

664
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:53,945
Yeah, it takes
a lot of work.

665
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,406
With the threat of rain
always a constant,

666
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:57,866
even if you guys
did have fire,

667
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,201
you're certainly not back there
tending to them now.

668
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,329
50 waterproof matches
should certainly make that

669
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,330
a lot easier.

670
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,165
It's one of the things

671
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,208
you're playing
for tonight-- the
other is this:

672
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,877
I want everybody to touch this,
get a good feel of this.

673
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,379
This is your life
on the island.

674
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:11,880
This is the immunity idol.

675
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,840
Oh. Ah.

676
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:14,883
Win this,

677
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,843
you stay on
the island a
few days longer.

678
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,094
Lose...

679
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,929
you face
tomorrow's Tribal Council,

680
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,389
where one of
you will be

681
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,391
the first person
voted off the island.

682
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,392
Big enough stakes?

683
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,393
Oh, yeah.

684
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,895
Okay, here's what we're doing.

685
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,271
There are two rafts

686
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,898
about 150 feet
out in the water.

687
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:33,234
Your job is to get your raft
back to the beach.

688
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,737
Along the way, a series
of torches both in the water

689
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,072
and on the land.

690
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,156
First team to light
all their torches

691
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:41,451
and their side of the fire
spirit wins immunity.

692
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,453
Here are the rules:
Each tribe member

693
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,288
has to have one
hand on the raft

694
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,207
at all times--
at<i> all</i> times.

695
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,541
Nobody can
swim ahead.

696
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,501
Nobody can fall behind.

697
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:50,919
The other rule: you have
to light every torch.

698
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,254
Don't put me in the position

699
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,631
of having to make
a judgment call.

700
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,257
I don't want to.
There's too much at stake.

701
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,258
Clear?

702
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,259
ALL:
Clear.

703
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,220
All right,
swim out to your rafts.

704
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,930
Wait for my signal.

705
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,107
Okay, Sue, listen up.

706
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,818
You're going to hold this.

707
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:15,902
How's that feel
for you carrying?

708
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,613
JEFF:
Here we go!

709
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,115
A storm is approaching!

710
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,450
Waterproof matches
and immunity at stake!

711
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,451
Go!

712
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,953
Here we go!

713
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,037
You got to lift.

714
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:29,040
Come on, team!

715
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:32,961
Here we go!
Light it! Light it!

716
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,964
Dry run it.
Dry run it.

717
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,132
Go, go, go!

718
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:37,924
Slow it down.

719
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,801
Go!

720
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,011
Come on, y'all.
Come on.go.

721
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:42,846
Do not wait for me.

722
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,640
(<i> all yelling</i> )

723
00:28:45,723 --> 00:28:47,308
No, no, no!

724
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,353
Go. Go. We got it.

725
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,980
Good job.

726
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,273
Go!

727
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:55,066
(<i> all yelling</i> )

728
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,152
Go!

729
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:57,944
(<i> all yelling</i> )

730
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,988
Throw it!

731
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:00,864
Go! Here we go! Come on!

732
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,700
To the flag!

733
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:04,367
Calm down.

734
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,994
Pick it up.
Pick it up.

735
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,495
Here comes the wave.

736
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,830
Pick it up.
Pick it up.

737
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,665
Let's go.

738
00:29:10,748 --> 00:29:11,332
Move it! Move it!
Move it!

739
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,668
Move it, move
it, move it!

740
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:15,128
Move it, move it,
move it!

741
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,921
Make sure
you get it.

742
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,384
Let's go!

743
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,344
Here we go!
Let's go!

744
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,679
Stop!

745
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:25,847
Come on, team!

746
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,848
We're doing good.

747
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:27,140
Three!

748
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:29,767
Come on!

749
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:30,977
Go!

750
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,520
Seven!till there!

751
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,814
We're doing it,
we're doing it,
we're doing it.

752
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,400
We're still there.
Come on.

753
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,068
Come on!
We're still there!

754
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,696
We're still
there!

755
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:43,698
We win!

756
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:44,199
Going back!

757
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:47,035
It's lit! It's lit!

758
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,369
No, keep it there.

759
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,370
We got it!

760
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,080
Yay!

761
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,709
Yeah, baby!

762
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:56,586
(<i> screaming</i> )

763
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:57,921
Yes!

764
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,132
JEFF:
Guys, great
competition.

765
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,510
Really close.

766
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:06,095
Pagong, you get
fire in the form

767
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,096
of 50 waterproof
matches.

768
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,391
(<i> team yelling</i> )

769
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,060
And more
importantly...

770
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,103
immunity from tomorrow's
Tribal Council.

771
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,981
You'll stay on the
island a few more days.

772
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,733
This is happening
every time!

773
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:20,109
Every time, this
is happening!

774
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,237
Every time!

775
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,571
JEFF:
Tagi.

776
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,031
That's why
we're winning.

777
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,574
We're going to stay...

778
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,575
Our island!

779
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,743
Tagi.

780
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:29,786
Nice competition.

781
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,287
You know the drill.

782
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,956
You have a date
with me tomorrow
for the Tribal Council,

783
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,542
where one of
you will be

784
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,960
the first person
voted off.

785
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,482
<i>You guys seen Dirk?</i>

786
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,443
Where the hell did he go?

787
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:49,240
<i>Oh, he goes...</i>
<i>He brought his bible with him?</i>

788
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,199
Yeah.

789
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,826
I think he's
pretty religious.

790
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:54,704
He was telling me he was
a youth minister or something.

791
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,080
(<i> reading quietly</i> )

792
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,475
Rain's coming.

793
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,185
Again?

794
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,186
That's all right.

795
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,187
I could always use
a wash.

796
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,815
RUDY:
Before we got
on the island here,

797
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,067
<i>I formed opinions</i>
<i>about people,</i>

798
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,862
but I changed my mind
just on that trip in.

799
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:28,863
<i>Rich, for one.</i>

800
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:31,366
<i>I mean, this guy is...</i>
<i>He's strong.</i>

801
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,367
<i>He's smart.</i>

802
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,034
<i>The guy surprises me.</i>

803
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:36,079
You know, he's fat, but he's...

804
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,497
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
he's good.

805
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,247
You can lay it
over those.

806
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,040
RICHARD:
<i>I like Rudy.</i>

807
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,249
<i>I'm not bothered</i>

808
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,335
<i>by his straightforwardness</i>
<i>at all.</i>

809
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,378
<i>I don't think</i>

810
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,379
it's even a problem.

811
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,755
I-I like it that he's saying

812
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,215
"Hey, do this,"
or, "Hey, do that,"

813
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,717
<i>but people are thinking of that</i>
<i>as very direct and arrogant.</i>

814
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,260
<i>That's the word I'm hearing,</i>
<i>and I'm thinking to myself</i>

815
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,222
"Well, they think<i> he's</i> arrogant;
Oh, my God, I'm out of here!"

816
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,143
(<i> thuds</i> )

817
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,234
Oh, my gosh.

818
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,694
What do we got?

819
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,780
The good news is
we'll be having fire tonight.

820
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:13,408
The bad news is
one of us won't be
here to enjoy it.

821
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,742
We got Tribal Council tonight.

822
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,077
"Pack your bags,
get ready to go,

823
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,538
which one it will be,
the world will soon know."

824
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:21,749
KELLY:
<i>Unfortunately, we're going</i>
<i>to have to vote somebody off.</i>

825
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,292
There's going to be
a lot of tension

826
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,169
and one of us is going to leave.

827
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,755
Well, what time we
got to do this at?

828
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,299
It just said,
"Get ready to go."

829
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:33,428
<i>Just, "Pack your bags,</i>
<i>get ready to go."</i>

830
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,222
I can't believe
we have to pack up.

831
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:39,058
We're just getting settled.

832
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:39,600
Well, somebody's gone.

833
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,561
So, it's time to think

834
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,104
<i>about who are they going</i>
<i>to vote for?</i>

835
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,772
<i>Why are they going to vote?</i>

836
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,190
I've narrowed it down to four.

837
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,191
I'm one of them.

838
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,444
Well, it could mean a lot

839
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,320
uh, either staying
or being voted out.

840
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:54,323
<i>You know,</i>
<i>last night's competition,</i>

841
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,243
<i>I really feel responsible</i>
<i>because I couldn't keep up</i>

842
00:33:57,326 --> 00:34:00,913
<i>and I was dragged totally</i>
<i>off my feet.</i>

843
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,958
<i>I do feel that that stumble</i>
<i>probably cost us</i>

844
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:06,419
the immunity challenge,
and that's a big one.

845
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,629
Up until, uh,
probably last night,

846
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,007
I never gave it
a second thought

847
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,300
about who I was going
to vote off

848
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:16,512
or if I got voted off,
but after last night, uh...

849
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:20,516
<i>I thought about it then,</i>
<i>and I decided then.</i>

850
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,394
I feel pretty secure, actually,
about the vote tonight.

851
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,354
<i>Kelly and I get along</i>
<i>real well</i>

852
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,106
<i>and we've been talking</i>

853
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,358
<i>about strategy, and, you know,</i>
<i>who's not contributing</i>

854
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,944
<i>as much, and who would be best</i>
<i>to vote off,</i>

855
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,697
and I think we-we've come
to a mutual decision

856
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,657
and we've talked to Sue
about it.

857
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,327
Stacey came up to me,
and it's, like,

858
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,995
<i>she don't like Rudy</i>

859
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:42,330
<i>and she's, like,</i>

860
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,373
<i>"Oh, I think we're going</i>
<i>to vote for Rudy,"</i>

861
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,666
<i>and vote him off</i>
<i>'cause he's so barking."</i>

862
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,878
<i>Well, anybody's too barking</i>
<i>and too bossy to Stacey</i>

863
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:50,588
<i>because she doesn't</i>
<i>move her ass.</i>

864
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:53,007
The chicks think I'm voting
for one person, and I'm not.

865
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,769
This is Tribal Council,
where each week

866
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,522
one member will be voted
off the island.

867
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,649
Last night,
in a crushing defeat

868
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,526
Tagi lost the immunity
challenge,

869
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:15,863
so, tonight, they will come here
and vote the first person off.

870
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,990
<i>It all begins</i>
<i>with a dangerous hike</i>

871
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,784
<i>through the jungle.</i>

872
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,997
<i>With so little time</i>
<i>to get acquainted,</i>

873
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,833
<i>everyone is vulnerable.</i>

874
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,211
<i>Rich's talk-versus-action</i>
<i>approach</i>

875
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,588
<i>may be more annoying</i>
<i>than helpful.</i>

876
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:38,052
<i>Sonja's tumble</i>
<i>cost them dearly.</i>

877
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:40,054
<i>One thing's for certain:</i>

878
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:42,223
<i>At Tribal Council,</i>
<i>you</i> are<i> held accountable</i>

879
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,224
<i>for your actions.</i>

880
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,393
<i>There</i> will<i> be a vote.</i>

881
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,269
<i>Someone</i> is<i> going home.</i>

882
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,896
I see torches.

883
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,773
Oh, that looks
pretty hairy.

884
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:51,816
(<i> birds chirping</i> )

885
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,238
(<i> gong sounds</i> )

886
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,157
Make our way around.

887
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,462
We begin
Tribal Council

888
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,505
with a ritual.

889
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,382
Behind each of you is a torch.

890
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:19,760
I'd like you to grab the torch
and approach the fire.

891
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,263
Go ahead and
dip your torches

892
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,431
in the flame
and light them.

893
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:26,934
Put them back in their
slot, and take a seat.

894
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:27,768
We do this because--

895
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,938
as I'm sure
you've discovered--

896
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,398
on the island,
fire represents life.

897
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,442
These torches now represent
your life, your identity

898
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,359
here at
Tribal Council.

899
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,778
The good news is

900
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,906
you will take these torches
with you when you leave

901
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,157
so you will have fire,

902
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,491
and you will bring them
back with you

903
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,743
to each Tribal Council.

904
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,286
Go ahead and
have a seat.

905
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,580
Well, leave it to me
to state the obvious,

906
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,957
but this is not a
place you want to be.

907
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,127
You tread in dangerous territory
every time you come here.

908
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,587
Tribal Council
is basically

909
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,797
where you account
for your actions
on the island.

910
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,507
Some of
those actions

911
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,176
will come back
to help you.

912
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,469
Some of them may come
back to haunt you,

913
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,096
but tonight, based
on those actions,

914
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,348
one of you will be
the first person
voted off the island.

915
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:08,559
So, before we
get to the vote,

916
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,560
let's talk about
what's been going on.

917
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,354
I'm curious
just about you guys getting here

918
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,314
and finding this place.

919
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,565
How was the
journey over here?

920
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,524
Saw two deadly snakes.

921
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:16,525
Really?

922
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,527
SUSAN:
Grand Canyon

923
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:19,528
mud slides...

924
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,988
It was great.

925
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:21,989
It was fun.

926
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,950
We're still starving.

927
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,159
We've eaten
but not really.

928
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:26,994
SONJA:
The competition
is stiffer.

929
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,120
The competition

930
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:28,829
we had last night was tough,

931
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,331
tougher than I had anticipated.

932
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,708
How are you holding up,
physically?

933
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,627
SONJA:
Well, pretty well,
you know.

934
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,505
I'll fight to the finish,
but, uh, I have my blisters

935
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,800
and whatnot,
but I'm-I'm doing okay.

936
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,343
What happened
after Quest for Fire?

937
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,636
That was a great competition--

938
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,096
obviously,
a lot at stake.

939
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,055
SONJA:
Oh, God.

940
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,181
We came close.

941
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:48,349
We almost got it.

942
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,184
SUSAN:
Aw, man, we were
dragged down two times

943
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:50,685
and we were right there.

944
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,519
We almost got it.

945
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,688
SUSAN:
There's no way.

946
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,231
All right, guys, well...

947
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:56,983
it's obviously a fun group.

948
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,693
This is not
a pleasant process...

949
00:37:58,776 --> 00:37:59,860
No, not at all.

950
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,529
JEFF:
And I know also,
from listening

951
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,364
to you guys talk,
that there are

952
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,490
a lot of different
reasons why you're here.

953
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:07,660
Obviously, $1 million--
big motivator for anybody,

954
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:08,828
but I'm sensing

955
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,538
there could be
personal reasons,

956
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,248
different journeys
you might be on

957
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,749
that-that this
encompasses.

958
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,376
Whatever it is,

959
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,419
to fulfill
that agenda,

960
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,545
you have to survive
tonight's Tribal Council.

961
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,673
That's the way it's set up.

962
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:23,050
So, what we're
going to do is vote

963
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,427
and how it
will work is

964
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,469
you'll come
down here.

965
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,013
You'll go across
this bridge

966
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,556
into our voting
confessional.

967
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,058
Write the name of the person
you want to vote off--

968
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:31,892
large, clear letters.

969
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,728
Hold it up,
and speak your piece.

970
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:34,770
We can't hear you.

971
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,023
Fold it up, put it
in the container,

972
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,899
come back, and
take a seat.

973
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:42,570
Now, once the votes are tallied,
the decision is final

974
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,238
and you have to leave

975
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:46,866
the Tribal Council
area immediately.

976
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,617
It's time to vote.

977
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,202
You're first.

978
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:15,686
Got to remove the weakest link
in the... crew.

979
00:39:31,368 --> 00:39:32,495
Stacey.

980
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:37,458
<i>Um, tough call.</i>

981
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,459
(<i> sighs</i> )

982
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,960
Subtle reasons...

983
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,088
I'm not sure
exactly what they are.

984
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:48,636
He's just...

985
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,138
<i>He's an ornery guy...</i>

986
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,681
<i>doesn't really help that much.</i>

987
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:57,186
For a Navy SEAL, he doesn't know
how to start fire...

988
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,521
and he
just criticizes everything.

989
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,152
I'm picking her

990
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:09,031
because I think she's the reason
we lost yesterday.

991
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,850
I'll miss his, uh, skills

992
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:40,104
and, um,
his speaking his mind openly.

993
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,576
Before I read these votes,
I just want to commend you

994
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:56,871
on the courage it's
taken to get this far.

995
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,373
There were a lot of
steps along the way.

996
00:40:59,456 --> 00:41:01,167
Any of you could've
turned around.

997
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,710
Nobody did,
and in my book

998
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,087
that gives you bragging
rights for life.

999
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,131
So, with that,
I'll read the votes.

1000
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,971
First vote-- Sonja.

1001
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:21,687
Sonja.

1002
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:28,819
Stacey.

1003
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:37,745
Sonja.

1004
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:44,960
Rudy.

1005
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,010
Rudy.

1006
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:00,768
Rudy.

1007
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,436
That's three
for Sonja

1008
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:04,021
and three for Rudy.

1009
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:07,816
The first person

1010
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,487
voted off the island...

1011
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,949
Sonja.

1012
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,451
Sonja, I need you
to grab your torch

1013
00:42:17,534 --> 00:42:18,953
and bring
it to me.

1014
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,138
The tribe
has spoken.

1015
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,605
Go get 'em, you guys.

1016
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,316
RICH:
Thanks, Sonja.

1017
00:42:49,400 --> 00:43:03,664
Thank you.

1018
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,958
JEFF:
Well, to the rest
of you, I guess

1019
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,543
a somber
congratulations.

1020
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:09,336
You've survived
the Tribal Council.

1021
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,504
You have fire.

1022
00:43:10,587 --> 00:43:11,797
You can head back to camp

1023
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,840
and I will see you tomorrow
for the next challenge.

1024
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,092
Good night.

1025
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,199
JEFF:
<i>Next week, on</i> Survivor...

1026
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,743
I've been
working my ass off

1027
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:43,162
and a lot of you have been
laying on your ass watching me.

1028
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,039
Don't give me any of that ....

1029
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,000
RUDY:
<i>Me and Richard got to be</i>
<i>pretty good friends--</i>

1030
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,877
not in a homosexual way,
that's for sure.

1031
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,837
(<i> screaming and laughing</i> )

1032
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,048
Swallow it, Gervase!

uh, an awesome experience.

1036
00:44:08,645 --> 00:44:12,900
<i>Being the first to be voted out</i>
<i>is a little humiliating.</i>

1037
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,778
<i>On the other hand,</i>

1038
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:18,238

<i>They're very strong physically,</i>

1040
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,535
and I-I think in their shoes,
I'd probably do the same thing.
