00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:09,509
IMMUNITY!

8
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:11,136
UPOLU, LED BY COACH, NARROWLY

9
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,263
WON THE FIRST IMMUNITY

10
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:16,433

00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,685
SO OZZY'S TRIBE, BLINDSIDED

12
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,103
THEIR WEAKEST PLAYER.

13
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,312
SEMHAR, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

14
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,273
AND SENT HER TO REDEMPTION

15
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,150
ISLAND.

16
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,234
MEANWHILE, AZY STRENGTHENED HIS

17
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,277
POSITION IN THE TRIBE BY FINDING

18
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,406
A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

19
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,700
THIS MIGHT BE MY TICKET TO

20
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:34,242
THE WIN.

21
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:34,701
Jeff: AND JOINING AN

00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:39,914
WHITNEY.

25
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,124
Jeff: COACH BUILT HIS OWN

26
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,126
ALLIANCE OF FIVE AND BRANDON

27
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,294
FELT SO CLOSE TO COACH, THAT HE

28
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:44,961
REVEALED HIS SECRET.

29
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:49,424
HIS UNCLE IS NIGH MY NUMBER

30
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:53,970
ONE NEMESIS, RUSSELL HANTZ.

31
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:55,513
AFTER UPOLU LOST THE SECOND

32
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,098
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, COACH WANTED

33
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:57,640
TO GET CHRISTINE OUT.

34
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,977
I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN WHAT

35
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,145
CHRISTINE SAID ON DAY ONE--

36
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,688
COACH IS A TEMPORARY PLAYER.

37
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:07,358
Jeff: BUT BRANDON INNATELY

38
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,485
DIDN'T TRUST MIKAYLA.

39
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,487
SO HE TOOK A PAGE FROM HIS

40
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,863
UNCLE'S PLAYBOOK AND SPREAD

41
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:12,822
FALSE RUMORS TO GET HER OUT.

42
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,824
JUST WALKED UP TO COACH AND I

43
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:15,992
LIED TO HIM.

44
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:18,661
STACEY AND CHRISTINE TOLD ME

45
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,330
THEY'RE VOTING OUT MIICALLIA.

46
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:25,877
Jeff: BUT AT TRIBAL OF

47
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,337
TRIBAL COUNCIL BRANDON CONFESSED

48
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,004

49
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:31,299
I TOLD EVERYONE TO VOTE FOR

50
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:31,966
MIKAYLA.

51
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,510
Jeff: IN THE END, COACH GOT

52
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,594
WHAT HE WANTED.

53
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:35,345
CHRISTINE, THE TRIBE HAS

54
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:35,970
SPOKEN.

55
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,347
AND CHRISTINE WAS SENT TO

56
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,349
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

57
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,350
WE'RE ONLY FIVE DAYS INTO THIS

58
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,393

59
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,520
OBSTACLE FOR THIS TRIBE IS

60
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,187

70
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:01,371

I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I DON'T

72
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,208
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AT TRIBAL?

73
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,876
I THINK MY TRIBE WAS NOT READY

74
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,545
FOR SOMEONE WHO WANTED TO PLAY

75
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,630
THE GAME RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX.

76
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,179
OH, REALLY?

77
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:18,596

80
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,016
ASS.

81
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,560
REALLY?

82
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:27,605
HE THINKS HE'S KING FAROUK.

83
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,065
I THINK COACH JUST HAD IT OUT

84
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,567
FOR ME FROM THE BEGINNING AND HE

85
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,904
WAS GOING TO DO WHATEVER IT TOOK

86
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,906
TO GET ME OUT, AND HE SUCCEEDED.

87
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,740
AT LEAST REDEMPTION ISLAND GIVES

00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,870
IT'S NOT OVER YET.

91
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:48,418
FAT LADY HAS NOT SUNG.

WHAT DID I DO?

103
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,437
I COULDN'T PINPOINT A THING.

104
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,983

REALLY NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT.

00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,739
COACH CAME OUT AND TOOK THE HEAT

109
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,449
OFF ME AND I HOPE IT STAYS OFF

110
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:19,866
ME.

111
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:20,575
I HAD NO IDEA.

112
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,118
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON.

113
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,286

I WAS ALMOST 150% SURE

121
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,504
MIKAYLA WAS GOING HOME.

122
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,465
THE PLAN BACKFIRED.

123
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,467
IT WAS A BLATANT LIE, AND I

124
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,135
REGRET EVER DOING THAT.

125
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:40,511
I CAME INTO THIS GAME NOT

I WANTED TO BE SOMEONE THAT YOU

132
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:51,689

00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,650

COACH WADE, YOU KNOW,

179
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:31,914
HE DIDN'T LIKE ME FROM

180
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:32,540
THE BEGINNING.

181
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,083
I JUST ARTICULATED WHAT

182
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:34,459
EVERYONE ELSE WAS

183
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:34,876

00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:38,421
RIGHT.

188
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,756
AND THEN HE DISLIKED

189
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,090
ME, AND I THINK THAT WAS

190
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:41,632
HIS OBJECTIVE, TO GET ME

191
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:42,425

192
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,426
SO I WANT TO GET BACK IN

193
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,595
THE GAME FOR ME.

194
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,597
Jeff: TELL ME ABOUT

195
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,598
REDEMPTION ISLAND,

196
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,182
SEMHAR.

197
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:49,766
YOU WERE OUT THERE FOR A

198
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,893
FEW NIGHTS ALL ALONE.

199
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:52,727
YEAH, REDEMPTION

200
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,396
ISLAND IS SCARY AND I

201
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,105
WAS ALONE.

202
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:56,481
I'M JUST READY TO KEEP

203
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:56,939
GOING.

204
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:57,523
Jeff: ALL RIGHT,

205
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,902
SHALL WE GET TO TODAY'S

206
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:01,360
DUEL?

207
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:01,944
TODAY'S DUEL WILL

208
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,946
REQUIRE CONCENTRATION

209
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:04,572
AND BALANCE.

210
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,115
ON MY GO, YOU WILL PLACE

211
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:06,657
A WOODEN TOTEM ON TOP OF

212
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,077
A POLE.

213
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,328
AT REGULAR INTERVALS YOU

214
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:10,953
WILL ADD ANOTHER SECTION

215
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,663
OF POLE, MAKING IT MORE

216
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,664
DIFFICULT TO KEEP

217
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,500
STABLE.

218
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,085
IF YOUR TOTEM FALLS OFF,

219
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:17,794
YOU'RE OUT OF THE DUEL

220
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,628
AND OUT OF THE GAME FOR

221
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,170
GOOD.

222
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:22,632
WINNER STAYS ALIVE AND

223
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,174
CONTINUES THEIR QUEST

224
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,342
FOR THE MILLION DOLLARS.

225
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:24,801
OKAY.

226
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,718
Jeff: MAKE SENSE?

227
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,345
THIS IS IT.

228
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,638
ONE SHOT, TAKE YOUR

229
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:36,771
SPOTS.

230
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:37,980
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING

231
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,357
I WOULDN'T DO FOR THIS

232
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:39,941
MAN.

233
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:40,691
I WOULD EVEN TAKE OFF MY

234
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,401
CLOTHES AND GIVE HIM A

235
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:42,860
PRIVATE SHOW TO THE

236
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:43,444
TUNES OF THE SOUL

237
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,487
BECAUSE HE'S ALL THEY

238
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,114
NEED NO MORE.

239
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,115
I WOULD GIVE BIRTH TO 10

240
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,116
OF HIS CHILDREN WITHOUT

241
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,033
USE ANYTHING DRUGS TO

242
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:49,700
HELP EASE THE PAIN AND

243
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:50,952
THEN I WOULD GIVE HIM

244
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:51,869
ONE MORE JUST BECAUSE

245
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,830
OUR LOVE IS THAT INSANE.

246
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,580
THERE IS NOT ONE THING

247
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,834
THEY WOULD NOT DO FOR MY

248
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,044
LOVER, MY BEST, FRIEND,

249
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:00,503
MY HONEY, MY BOO.

250
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:00,837
I CAN'T WAIT TO

251
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,379
MEET HIM.

252
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,005
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOOD.

253
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:03,673
Jeff: IS THAT A

254
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,550
LITTLE SPOKEN WORD?

255
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,634
DOES THAT CALM YOU?

256
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:07,051
LIKE CRAZY.

257
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,678
Jeff: CHRISTINE,

258
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,679
YOU CALM?

259
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,013
LET'S DO THIS DUEL.

260
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,224
TAKE YOUR FIRST POLE.

261
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,517
PLACE YOUR TOTEM ON TOP.

262
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,309
GET IT WHERE YOU WANT

263
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:15,852
IT.

264
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:16,686
ONCE YOU HAVE THE POLE

265
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,354
IN PLACE, BOTH HANDS

266
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:19,856
NEED TO BE ON THE

267
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:25,236
HANDLE.

268
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:33,035
THIS DUEL IS ON.

269
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,744
BE VERY CAREFUL WITH

270
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:34,412
YOUR MOVEMENTS.

271
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,497
IT IS ABOUT

272
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,039
CONCENTRATION AND

273
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,749
REMEMBERING WHERE THAT

274
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,044
CENTER POINT IS.

275
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:42,545
OKAY.

276
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,089
IT IS TIME TO ADD

277
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,257
ANOTHER SECTION OF POLE.

278
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,300
WATCH YOUR BALANCE, MAKE

279
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,260
SURE THAT IS LEVEL.

280
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,512
TAKE YOUR TIME.

281
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,097
MAKE SURE THAT TOTEM

282
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:53,598
DOESN'T FALL WHILE

283
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,058
YOU'RE DOING THIS.

284
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:56,726
CHRISTINE HAS HER SECOND

285
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:01,063
SECTION IN.

286
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,315
SEMHAR HAS HER SECOND

287
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,859
SECTION IN.

288
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,277
THE BEAUTIFUL THING

289
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,361
ABOUT REDEMPTION ISLAND,

290
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,739
IT IS A SECOND CHANCE.

291
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,948
THERE WOULD BE NOTHING

292
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,951
SWEETER THAN TO GET BACK

293
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,578
INTO THIS GAME.

294
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,581
ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME TO

295
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,291
ADD ANOTHER SECTION OF

296
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,083
POLE.

297
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,752
TAKE YOUR TIME.

298
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,962
DO NOT PANIC, AND DO NOT

299
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:25,963
LOSE IT.

300
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:26,756
IF IT FALLS WHILE YOU'RE

301
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,341
PUTTING ANOTHER SECTION

302
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:28,799
IN, YOU ARE OUT OF THIS

303
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:39,644
DUEL.

304
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:45,316
DUEL.

305
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,567
SEMHAR WITH A NICE

306
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,068
RECOVERY.

307
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,194
BOTH WOMEN IN GOOD

308
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:48,778
SHAPE.

309
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,363
BOTH WOMEN STRONG AGAIN.

310
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,156
KEEP FOCUSED.

311
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,698
DON'T DRIFT.

312
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,157
DON'T START THINKING

313
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:58,621
ABOUT ANYTHING.

314
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,790
CHRISTINE STARTING TO

315
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:01,332
WOBBLE.

316
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,959
THE LONGER THESE POLES

317
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:03,668
GET, THE MORE LIKELY

318
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:03,960
THEY ARE TO SWAY AT THE

319
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,754
TOP.

320
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,422
SEMHAR WITH JUST A

321
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:18,474
LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT.

322
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:24,772
LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT.

323
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:25,356
CHRISTINE SLIPPING A

324
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:29,652
LITTLE.

325
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,654
SEMHAR LOSE HERSELF

326
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,238
TOTEM.

327
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:32,989
CHRISTINE STATES ALIVE.

328
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,365
AND CONTINUES HER QUEST

329
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:39,829
FOR THE MILLION DOLLARS.

330
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,999
SO, SEMHAR, WHAT'S THE

331
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:43,499
EMOTION?

332
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:45,459
MY TRIBE SENT ME TO

333
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,168
REDEMPTION, IT JUST

334
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,295
BROUGHT BACK A LOT OF

335
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,880
MEMORIES FROM MY PAST.

336
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:50,423
I'VE MOVED SO MANY TI

I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW

341
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,224
PEOPLE CAN BE SO CRUEL

342
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:00,683
AND IT'S HOW I FELT

343
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,183
ABOUT MY TRIBE.

I NEVER GIVE UP ON

00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:08,524

TO SEE IF I WOULD LOSE.

387
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,082
HE'S JUST A DOPE.

388
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:06,916
I'M HOPING THEY PULL A

389
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,959
MATT AND HAVE A RUN HERE

390
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,629
AND THEN GET BACK IN.

391
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,756
I KNOW I'LL WIN.

392
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,943
THIS MORNING, GOD WAS

393
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:34,610
CHASTISING ME BIG TIME.

394
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,153
HE WAS NOT PLEASED WITH ME.

395
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,615
I WAS NOT PLEASED WITH ME, AND I

396
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:40,032
KNOW MY FAMILY WOULDN'T BE

397
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,743
PLEASED WITH ME.

398
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,370
I LIED BLATANTLY.

399
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,746
I KNEW THAT MY TRIBE WOULD

400
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,832
BELIEVE ME, AND I LIED TO THEM.

401
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:51,460
THEY WANTED CHRISTINE TO GO

402
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,462
HOME, BUT I KNEWIMENTED MIKAYLA

403
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,171
TO GO HOME.

404
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,465
THERE'S JUST CERTAIN THINGS THAT

405
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,883
I CAN'T ALLOW MYSELF TO CONTINUE

406
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:58,592
ON.

407
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,010
I DON'T WANT TO LIE ANY MORE.

408
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,263
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY GAMES ANY

409
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:07,017
MORE WITH THESE PEOPLE.

410
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:07,935
I REALLY WANTED TO TAKE OFF MY

411
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:16,986
SHIRT REALLY BAD.

412
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,487
IS EVERYBODY HERE?

413
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,489
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU GUYS AND

414
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,283
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WAS OUT IN

415
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,201
THE OPEN.

416
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,997
UHM, MY NAME IS BRANDON HANTZ.

417
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,500
I'M RUSSELL HANTZ'S NEPHEW.

418
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,293
I'M SORRY.

419
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:32,751
ARE YOU REALLY?

420
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:33,711
ARE YOU REALLY?

421
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,379
WOW.

422
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:35,880
AND I'M NOT THE SAME PERSON

423
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:36,839
THAT HE IS.

424
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,716
I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.

425
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,050
AND I ACCEPT THE CONSEQUENCES OF

426
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:40,968
WHAT I DID.

427
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,846
I JUST-- I'D RATHER MAKE FRIENDS

428
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,182
OUT HERE THAN A MILLION DOLLARS.

429
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,476
HE COMES OUT AND SAYS HE'S

430
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,561
RUSSELL'S NEPHEW.

431
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,230
I'M LIKE WHOA.

432
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,690
I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING

433
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,357
BEHIND THIS KID.

434
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,151
YOU SAY YOU DON'T WANT TO LIE

435
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,819
BUT YOU KEEP DOING IT.

436
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,029
I THINK IT'S AN EASY OUT FOR

437
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:00,738
HIM.

438
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,031
HE DOES SOMETHING BAD AND HE'S

439
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:06,535
HEE GOES, "GUYS THAT'S NOT ME."

440
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,244
YOU HAVE HANTZ ON YOUR ARM.

441
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,371
I FEEL LIKE NOBODY NOTICED THAT.

442
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,372
MAYBE HE'S TRYING TO COVER

443
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,999
HIS TRACKS BEFORE HE MAKES THEM.

444
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,083
BUT I DON'T TRUST HIM.

445
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,420
I THINK HE'S A SNEAK.

446
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:16,962
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HIS

447
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,881
PROBLEM IS WITH ME.

448
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:23,719
WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE?

449
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,888
I'M BRANDON HANTZ.

450
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:26,388
I'M ME.

451
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,556
I LOVE GOD.

452
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,058
I LOVE JESUS CHRIST, AND I

453
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,060
SHOULDN'T BE ASHAMED OF THE FACT

454
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,102
THAT I'M A DIFFERENT PERSON THAN

455
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,021
MY UNCLE.

456
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,898
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU BEFORE

457
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,902
I DID IT, BUT I WAS REALLY

458
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,237
CONFLICTED, MAN.

459
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,571
HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY,

460
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,280
MAN.

461
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,573
I COMMEND YOU FOR SAYING THAT.

462
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,241
I REALLY DO.

463
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,408
TRUST ME, I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO

464
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,368
BEEF WITH YOU WHATSOEVER.

465
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,035
THANK YOU.

466
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,037
BRANDON TOLD THE TRIBE THAT

467
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,915
HE WAS RUSSELL HANTZ'S NEPHEW.

468
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,792
A MISTAKE, IN MY OPINION, BUT HE

469
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,086
NEED TO GET IT OFF HIS CHEST

470
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,088
AND, YOU KNOW, THAT SHOWS

471
00:13:59,171 --> 00:13:59,922
BRANDON'S AGE A LITTLE BIT.

472
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,299
HE LETS THINGS GET TO HIM THAT

473
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,092
CAN WEIGH HIM DOWN.

474
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,468
IT'S NOT A COOL THING, MAN.

475
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,095
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

476
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:06,929
MANIPULATION IS MANIPULATION, NO

477
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,515
MATTER HOW YOU COAT IT.

478
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,935
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF I'M

479
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,853
MANIPULATING YOU, IF I'M NOT

480
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,273
MANIPULATING YOU, IF I'M

481
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,107
MANIPULATING EVERYBODY ELSE.

482
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:18,774
RIGHT.

483
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,150
BRANDON IS A VALUABLE OF THE

484
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,110
SENATE MY ALLIANCE.

485
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,737
I STILL TRUST BRANDON,

486
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:24,446
ABSOLUTELY.

487
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,447
BUT IT'S JUST MAYBE NOT IN WITH

488
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,073
BOTH FEET NOW.

489
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:26,991
I KIND OF HAD A RELAPSE OF

490
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,577
WHAT MY UNCLE USED TO DO AND IT

491
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:35,124
SUCKED.

492
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:40,421
BEST ONE YET, I THINK.

493
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,131
WE HAVE A GOOD CAMP LIFE.

494
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,132
WE HAVE FOOD.

495
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,133
WE HAVE SHELTER.

496
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,134
PEOPLE GET ALONG.

497
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,762
BUT THE REALITY IS, IN EVERY

498
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:49,972
TRIBE, THERE'S A PECKING ORDER.

499
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,641
I THINK THE MINORITY IS ME,

500
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,809
COCHRAN, AND DAWN.

501
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:55,019
ME AND DAWN FOR AGE, AND COCHRAN

502
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:58,147
BECAUSE HE JUST IS THE NERDY KID

503
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,023
NOBODY HUNG OUT WITH IN SCHOOL.

504
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,816
SORRY, JOHN.

505
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,944
I JUST DIDN'T CLICK WITH ANYONE

506
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:04,403
HERE.

507
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,946
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

508
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,156
SO EVERY CHALLENGE IS IMPORTANT

509
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:07,698
TO ME.

510
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,157
I AM NOT SAFE AT ALL.

511
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,326
YEAH, BABY.

512
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,245
OZZY, THAT'S AWESOME.

513
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,665
IT'S MYSELF, KEITH, WHITNEY,

514
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,375
ALLYCE, AND JIM.

515
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,710
BUT I THINK KEITH AND I, WE

516
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,170
HAVE, LIKE, A SORT OF

517
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,631
BROTHER-TYPE THING GOING ON.

518
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,632
THERE'S GOT TO BE A CERTAIN

519
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,175
POINT WHERE I HAVE TO TRUST

520
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:26,884
SOMEBODY WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT

521
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,886
I HAVE THE IDOL, AND WHO BETTER

522
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:29,637
THAN KEITH?

523
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,512
I JUST THINK THAT HE'S GOING TO

524
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,640
BE A STRONG ALLY, AND AS FAR AS

525
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,684
I KNOW, HE'S REALLY TRUSTED

526
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,101
WORTHY.

527
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:36,477
I HAVE THE IDOL.

528
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,354
AW, SWEET!

529
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,189
LIKE I SAID, MAN, I TRUST

530
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,190
YOU, AND I--

531
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,025
I HOPE SO.

532
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:43,901
I MEAN, I TRUST YOU.

533
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,194
IF I DIDN'T, I WOULDN'T HAVE

534
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:51,367
SAID ANYTHING.

535
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,284
OSSIE FOUND IT.

536
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:52,534
YOU'RE SURE?

537
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,661
YUP.

538
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,286
100% POSITIVE?

539
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:54,703
YEAH.

540
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,163
HE TOLD YOU?

541
00:15:56,246 --> 00:16:00,501
YUP.

542
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:03,379
YUP.

543
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,048
I'M KIND OF SURPRISED HE TOLD

544
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:06,715
YOU.

545
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,801
HE HAS TO TELL ME BECAUSE IT

546
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:09,843
GIVES HIM ALL THE POWER.

547
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,054
RIGHT.

548
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,056
I'M MAD THAT OZZY HAS THE

549
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,599
IDOL BECAUSE IT GIVES HIM ALL

550
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,309
THE POWER-- OR MOST OF THE POWER

551
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,060
RIGHT NOW PUP KNOW, IT GIVES HIM

552
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,562
THE BETTER HOLDS ON THE

553
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,271
ALLIANCE.

554
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,691
SO I TOLD WHITNEY BECAUSE I WANT

555
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,068
HER TO TRUST ME JUST IN CASE

556
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,236
DOWN THE LINE SOMETHING WERE TO

557
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,613
HAPPEN WHERE I NEEDED NUMBERS

558
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,073
BECAUSE I THOUGHT OZZY MIGHT BE

559
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:31,740
MAKING A MOVE.

560
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,075
YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL THAT

561
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,326
HE DOESN'T KNOW THEY TOLD YOU.

562
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,035
RIGHT, OKAY.

563
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:45,129
AND IT'S GOT TO BE LIKE HARD.

564
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,424
HEY, BRANDON, YOU GOT A

565
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,299
MINUTE, BUD?

566
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,759
SO I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE

567
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,427
AGAINST ME?

568
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,094
I-- I WANTED YOU TO GO HOME.

569
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,430
I THINK IT'S FUNNY.

570
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,098
YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAD A PROBLEM,

571
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:56,390
YOU SAY, "MIKAYLA, WHAT'S THE

572
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,057
DEAL?"

573
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,226
DID YOU COME UP TO MY FACE?

574
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,728
NO, YOU DID SNEAKY STUFF BEHIND

575
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:01,437
MY BACK.

576
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,146
ARE YOU TRYING TO MESS WITH MY

577
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,272
WORDS BECAUSE YOU WANT ME OUT

578
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,774
BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE ME.

579
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:06,608
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.

580
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,276
IT WAS.

581
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,403
IT REALLY WAS.

582
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,280
AND I MADE THAT 19 TO EVERYBODY.

583
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,323
WHY DON'T YOU LIKE ME?

584
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,908
JUST THE ATTITUDE.

585
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,910
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE HAVING

586
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,495
THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE IS

587
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,747
SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE STILL TRYING

588
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,248
TO GET THE FACT THAT I'M

589
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,624
APOLOGIZING TO YOU.

590
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,293
YOU JUST TOLD ME YOU DIDN'T

591
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:24,877
LIKE ME.

592
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,253
BEFORE ME DOING ANYTHING,

593
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,963
PEOPLE DIDN'T TRUST YOU.

594
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,007
MIKAYLA WAS COMING AT ME LIKE A

595
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:30,382
BULLDOG, LIKE SHE WAS GOING TO

596
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,259
ATTACK ME.

597
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,470
HEY, GUYS, CAN WE GATHER AROUND

598
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,471
FOR A SECOND?

599
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,681
BUT AS A CHRISTIAN, I'M SUPPOSED

600
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:38,390
TO BE MEEK.

601
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,433
I'M SUPPOSED TO TURN THE OTHER

602
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,100
CHEEK.

603
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:40,851
BUT I'M TELL YOU AS A MAN I

604
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,269
WANTED YOU OUT OF THIS GAME

605
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:42,978
REALLY BAD.

606
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:44,271
AND SHE WALKED UP TO ME THE WAY

607
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,939
SHE DID, I WAS VERY UPSET.

608
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,316
WHAT I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO

609
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,776
HER, SHE'S WONDERING WHY I WANT

610
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:49,985
TO VOTE HER OUT, OKAY.

611
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:50,652
AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK

612
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,946
AROUND AND SEE WHO IS REALLY

613
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,615
LOYAL AND WHO IS REALLY NOT

614
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,283
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE TO ME YOU

615
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,994
DON'T HAVE MUCH OF AN ALLIANCE,

616
00:17:59,077 --> 00:17:59,661
PERIOD.

617
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:06,710
ANYBODY HAS ANYTHING TO SAY?

618
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,170
I DON'T WANT NO MORE OF THIS

619
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,380
FROM EVERYBODY.

620
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,174
I-- JUST RESPECT THAT FROM ME.

621
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,219
KEEP ME OUT OF THE DRAMA.

622
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:19,556
THERE YOU GO.

623
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,144
THAT'S IT.

624
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,854
GOD, OH, MY GOD.

625
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:26,855
I WAS IN SO MUCH SHOCK.

626
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:27,689
WE ALL DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING AFTER

627
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,440
THAT.

628
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,691
HE SAY LOOSE CANNON AND THERE'S

629
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,151
A LOT OF TENSION BETWEEN BRENDAN

630
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:35,656
AND MIKAYLA INSPECT HIS BIBLICAL

631
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,157
TERMS HE'D PROBABLY CALL HER THE

632
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,325
WHORE OF BABYLON.

633
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,994
I THINK BRANDON RIGHT NOW, HE'S

634
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,164
TORN BETWEEN FOLLOWING WHATEVER

635
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,749
CRAZY BELIEFS HE HAS, AND YET AT

636
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,416
THE SAME TIME HE INHERENTLY IN

637
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,169
HIS BLOOD LINE IS A DEVIOUS

638
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,254
JERK.

639
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,225
I WAS TOLD BY MY POP ABY MY

640
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,061
DAD, DO NOT LOSE YOUR TEMPER.

641
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:08,772
AND IT'S PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

642
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:09,773
BEING ACARINE, I SHOULDN'T HAVE

643
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:10,607
LOST MY TEMPER.

644
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,275
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

645
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,568
CONTROL MYSELF AND I DIDN'T.

646
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:16,572
I FAILED.

647
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,949
I JUST LET MY FLESH GET AHOLE OF

648
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:19,658
ME.

649
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,451
I MEAN, I STRUGGLE EVERY DAY.

650
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,454
THIS IS-- THIS IS LIKE A

651
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,415
CONSTANT BATTLE FOR ME--

652
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,458
GOOD-EVIL, GOOD-EVIL, GOOD-EVIL.

653
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:35,591
I REALLY WANT TO DO GOOD.

654
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,426
YOU JUST, LORD, PLEASE DON'T LET

655
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:41,263
ME SIN ANYMORE.

656
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,764
WHAT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO

657
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,850
DO IS SAY, "COME ON, LET'S JUST

658
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,394
LAY IT ALL OUT, SCREW YOU," AND

659
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,937
THEN YOU SPOOK YOUR OWN ALLIANCE

660
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:49,605
AND YOU SPEAK MIKAYLA.

661
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,316
THAT BASICALLY DID NOBODY ANY

662
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,066
GOOD.

663
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,568
THIS SITUATION GREATLY CONCERNS

664
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:55,235
ME.

665
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,069
IT IS THE EPITOME OF SNAFU.

666
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,779
I'M WORRIED THAT BRANDON'S

667
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,947
OUTBURST CAUSES UNEASINESS IN

668
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,365
THE TRIBE, UNEASINESS IN THE

669
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,284
ALLIANCE, AND WE ARE ALL HOPING

670
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,078
AND PRAYING THAT BRANDON HAS NO

671
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,413
FURTHER SUCH OUTBURSTS.

672
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,331
IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF

673
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,833
AGGRESSION THAN RUSSELL HAD, BUT

674
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,461
IT'S AN AGGRESSION NONETHELESS.

675
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,380
I HATE TO SAY IT, THE BUT I DO

676
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,341
SEE A LITTLE RUSSELL IN IN HIM.

677
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,050
OH, TOTALLY.

678
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,760
I JUST HOPE IT DOESN'T BITE US

679
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:20,469
IN THE BUTT.

680
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,363
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

681
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,710

SAVAII, I WILL TAKE IT BACK.

ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

688
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:06,848
FOR GRABS.

689
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,852
ON MY GO, ONE PERSON FROM EACH

690
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,688
TRIBE WILL RACE ACROSS A

691
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,690
FLOATING BRIDGE CARRYING A BODY

692
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,234
BOARD ATTACHED TO A LONG ROPE.

693
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:20,028
ONCE YOU REACH THE PLATFORM,

694
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,488
YOU'LL GRAB A BAG AND HANG ON AS

695
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:27,327
THE REST OF THE TRIBE WILL CRANK

696
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,203
A GIANT WENCH BRINGING YOU BACK

697
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:28,870
TO SCORE.

698
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,872
THE REMAINING TRIBE MEMBERS WILL

699
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:31,540
USE GRAPPLING HOOKS TO RETRIEVE

700
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,165
THEM.

701
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:36,044
INSIDE THE BAGS ARE PUZZLE

702
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,712
BANNERS.

703
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,421
YOU MUST ROLL THE BANNERS DOWN

704
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,298
THE FACE OF THE WALL AND ARRANGE

705
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,382

HIDDEN AT THEIR CAMP.

723
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,535
WORTH PLAYING FOR.

YES!

725
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,579

YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE THEM ENOUGH

736
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,643
SLACK OR YOU WILL SLOW THEM

737
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:34,227

ROPE.

741
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:43,779
IF YOU'RE NOT MANAGING YOUR

00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,299
HE-- HE-- HE SLOWS US DOWN.

948
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:38,925
HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE FIRST

949
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,635
ONE OUT.

950
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,325
I STILL THINK WE'RE THE

951
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,326
STRONGER TRIBE.

952
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,327
WE DID A GOOD JOB.

953
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,204
EVERYBODY DID A GOOD JOB.

954
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,039
WE JUST-- YOU WIN SOME, YOU LOSE

955
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:10,623
SOMEONE.

956
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,374
IT'S THE WAY IT GOES.

957
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,126
WE LOST THE CHALLENGE TODAY,

958
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,961
AND IT DOES SUCK.

959
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,004
IT'S REALLY BAD FOR MORALE.

960
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,339
WE'RE GOING TO TRIBAL COUNCIL

961
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,007
TONIGHT.

962
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:19,966
AND WE'VE GOT TO VOTE SOMEBODY

963
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,176
OFF, AND THAT MEANS CUTTING

964
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,678
PEOPLE THAT AREN'T REALLY THAT

965
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:24,679
GOOD AT CHALLENGES.

966
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:27,474
DAWN DID A GREAT JOB TODAY, MAN.

967
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,808
SHE KICKED ASS.

968
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,519
IT'S BASICALLY BETWEEN PAPA BEAR

969
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,522
AND COCHRAN.

970
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,149
ARE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT

971
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:36,858
TONIGHT?

972
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:37,692
DO YOU HAVE BUTTERFLIES IN YOUR

973
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:38,193
STOMACH?

974
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:38,985
I THINK I HAVE GAS.

975
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,862
HOW MUCH EASIER WOULD IT BE TO

976
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,530
BE IN THE GROUP, RIGHT?

977
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,656
ALL THEY'RE SITTING PRETTY.

978
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,699
'CAUSE THOSE FIVE HAVE

979
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:46,034
CONNECTED.

980
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,745
WE WE GOT PUT ON BARBIE DOLL'S

981
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,788
AND KEN'S TEAM, WE REALLY DID.

982
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,248
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU AND I

983
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,501
BECAME--

984
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:55,001
BECAUSE WE LOOK DIFFERENT.

985
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,669
WE TALK DIFFERENT.

986
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:57,378
WE SAY DIFFERENT THINGS.

987
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,048
I MEAN, IT'S OBVIOUS, IF I GO

988
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:00,340
TONIGHT, YOU'RE GOING TOMORROW.

989
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,007
YEAH.

990
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,884
IF YOU GO TONIGHT, I'M GOING

991
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:03,176
TOMORROW.

992
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:03,843
RIGHT.

993
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,679
I'M JUST HOPING IT'S NOT ME

994
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:07,305
TONIGHT.

995
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,389
OBVIOUSLY, I'M HOPING IT'S

996
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,308
NOT ME TONIGHT.

997
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:17,440
WE ARE UP THE CREEK, BRO.

998
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:18,483
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

999
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:21,611
YOU GUYS ARE THINKING ALL PAPA

1000
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:21,986
RIGHT.

1001
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,570
PAPA BEAR.

1002
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,947
IT'S SAD TO SEE, BUT--

1003
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,782
I'D RATHER JUST, LIKE, DECIDE

1004
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:29,410
THIS RIGHT NOW AND NOT--

1005
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,621
I SAY PAPA.

1006
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,122
I'M WITH YOU.

1007
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:33,915
I'M IN.

1008
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,542
TELL HIM COCHRAN.

1009
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,586
TELL HIM COCHRAN.

1010
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,256
WE HAVE TO.

1011
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,882
WE'LL KEEP THE LINE OF

1012
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:43,424
COMMUNICATION OPEN.

1013
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,425
IF YOU HEAR ANYTHING--

1014
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:48,596
JUST SO YOU KNOW, IT'S PAPA

1015
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,264
BEAR.

1016
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:49,556
SO THIS IS HAPPENING AGAIN?

1017
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,431
YEAH.

1018
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,934
JUST SO YOU KNOW.

1019
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,061
OZZY APPROACHED ME AND SAID

1020
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,605
WE'RE GOING TO TELL PAPA BEAR

1021
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,108
THAT IT'S YOU, BUT IT'S REALLY

1022
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,734
GONNA BE PAPA BEAR.

1023
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,444
THE FACT THAT MY NAME KEEPS

1024
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,655
COMING UP IS VERY UPSETTING.

1025
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:06,155
I DON'T WANT TO BE SENT TO

1026
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:06,864
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

1027
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:07,615
I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE KIND OF

1028
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,242
VIEW IT AS A CHANCE TO GET BACK

1029
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:10,451
IN THE GAME.

1030
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,078
I VIEW IT AS A CHANCE FOR,UN,

1031
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:15,790
EXTENDED FAILURE AND JUST MORE

1032
00:31:15,873 --> 00:31:16,457
DEPRESSION.

1033
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,125
SO I MIGHT DO SOME LAST-MINUTE

1034
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:17,834
SCRAMBLING.

1035
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,627
THE PROBLEM IS I ALREADY HAVE

1036
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,130
THIS REPUTATION AS THE NERVOUS,

1037
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,674
NEUROTIC SCRAMBLER.

1038
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:25,675
IF I RESURRECT THAT BEFORE THE

1039
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:26,301
NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL, I THINK

1040
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,427
IT'S GOING TO HURT ME.

1041
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:31,639
I JUST DON'T WANT TO GO HOME.

1042
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,265
COCHRAN'S GOING HOME.

1043
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:35,184
WHY WOULD THEY CHOOSE HIM?

1044
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,437
BECAUSE HE WAS GONNA BE THE

1045
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,481
FIRST PERSON OUT.

1046
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,983
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?

1047
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:42,650
WHAT?

1048
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,820
COCHRAN?

1049
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:46,237
WHY?

1050
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,155
IT'S OBVIOUS.

1051
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,991
HE WAS THE FIRST ONE.

1052
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,118
HE GOT SAVED.

1053
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,621
THEY SAY IT'S COCHRAN

1054
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:55,079
TONIGHT.

1055
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,164
I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

1056
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:56,998
PAPA BEAR IS ON THE CHOPPING

1057
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,000
BLOCK BIG TIME.

1058
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,169
YOU KNOW THEY SAY, "YOU'RE OKAY,

1059
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,337
YOU'RE OKAY."

1060
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,631
OBVIOUSLY, TO STOP ME FROM

1061
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:05,256
ASKING.

1062
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:05,965
IT'S JOHN COCHRAN TONIGHT.

1063
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:06,341
SURE, I BELIEVE THAT.

1064
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:12,055
I'M AN ASS.

1065
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,181
I'M LOOKING FOR THE IDOL.

1066
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:27,654
IT'S MY ONLY HOPE AT THIS POINT.

1067
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,030
I'M ON MY WAY TO THE SHELTER,

1068
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:32,867
AND PAPA BEAR GOES IN A DEAD

1069
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,243
SPRINT FROM THE WATER TO THE

1070
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:34,994
WOODS.

1071
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,204
AND PAPA BEAR DISTRIBUTE SPRINT

1072
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:36,913
EVER.

1073
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,165
SO I'M LIKE, DID ANYBODY ELSE

1074
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:40,166
SEE THAT?

1075
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:43,878
DYOU SEE PAPA BEAR JUST TALK OFF

1076
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:45,046
RUNNING INTO THE WOODS?

1077
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:45,672
RUNNING?

1078
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,465
YEAH, DEAD SPRINT FROM THE

1079
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:48,174
BEACH.

1080
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:51,427
ANYBODY CARE TO JOIN ME?

1081
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,012
HE'S UP TO SOMETHING.

1082
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,222
JIM AND I WALKED INTO THE WOODS,

1083
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:59,060
AND JUST KIND OF PEAKED AROUND.

1084
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,688
AND HE'S JUST LIKE DIGGING

1085
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:02,397
THROUGH THE DIRT LIKE A LITTLE

1086
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,942
GOPHER, AND HE'S STILL AT IT.

1087
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,069
WOULDN'T IT BE WILD IF HE FOUND

1088
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:08,444
THAT CLUE.

1089
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:15,576
OR THE IDOL.

1090
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,077
I'M IN AN EMERGENCY

1091
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,703
SITUATION.

1092
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,788
I SEARCHED FOR THE IDOL

1093
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:19,914
EVERYWHERE, I COULDN'T FIND IT.

1094
00:33:19,997 --> 00:33:20,581
THE BEST THING I CAN DO IS MAKE

1095
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,625
THEM THINK I HAVE THE IDOL AND

1096
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,334
PLAY THEM AND HOPEFULLY THEY

1097
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,253
VOTE FOR JOHN BUT I'M GOING TO

1098
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,130
PLAY IT LIKE I FOUND IT, AND I'M

1099
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,840
NOT GOING TO SHOW THEM.

1100
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,091
I'M JUST GOING TO MAKE IT LIKE A

1101
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,968
FOUND IT.

1102
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:40,435
AND HOPEFULLY, THIS WORKS.

1103
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,602
DO YOU THINK HE FOUND IT?

1104
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,603
I DON'T KNOW.

1105
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,272
HE WAS SEARCHING FOR STUFF.

1106
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:44,897
I MEAN, YOU AND I SAW HIM LIKE

1107
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:45,606
HE WAS SEARCHING.

1108
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,274
HE WAS DIGGING.

1109
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,233
BUT IT WAS IN DIFFERENT

1110
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:47,942
PLACES.

1111
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:48,568
APPARENTLY JIM AND ALLYCE HAD

1112
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:51,154
SEEN PAPA BEAR FRANTICALLY

1113
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,614
DIGGING FOR SOMETHING NEAR A

1114
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,282
TREE.

1115
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,283
ABOUT FIVE MINUTES LATER, PAPA

1116
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,286
BEAR COMES WALTZING INTO CAME

1117
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,912
WITH THIS BIG SMILE ON HIS FACE

1118
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,832
AND AN EXTRA-LARGE BULGE IN HIS

1119
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,168
UNDERPANTS AND HE CLEARLY WANTS

1120
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:10,298
US TO THINK HE HAS THE IDOL.

1121
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,924
PAPA BEAR CAME TO ME AND SAID

1122
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:12,592
HE HAD THE IDOL.

1123
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:15,428
ALL OF A SUDDEN, THAT'S THE

1124
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:16,471
VARIABLE IN THERE.

1125
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,848
LET'S SAY HE DOES HAVE THE IDOL?

1126
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:19,807
LET'S PROTECT AGAINST THAT.

1127
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,643
THE PLAN MIGHT HAVE TO CHANGE.

1128
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,311
COCHRAN COULD GO HOME TONIGHT.

1129
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,312
IT'S POSSIBLE IT'S AN ACT TO

1130
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,647
MAKE YOU THINK HE HAS IT.

1131
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,649
I HOPE MY TRIBEMATES SEE THROUGH

1132
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,777
THE CHARADE, BUT MY FEAR IS EVEN

1133
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,153
IF THEY DON'T BELIEVE HIM, IT'S

1134
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:35,448
NO SKIN OFF THEIR BACK TO SWITCH

1135
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,658
THEIR VOTE TO ME FROM PAPA BEAR

1136
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,328
AND I'D BE SCREWED.

1137
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:43,039
IT'S INCREDIBLY FUNNY TO

1138
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:43,748
WATCH EVERYBODY SCRAMBLING

1139
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:44,999
AROUND STRESSED OUT THAT PAPA

1140
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:45,666
BEAR MIGHT HAVE THE IDOL.

1141
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:49,003
I MEAN, I ALREADY HAVE IT.

1142
00:34:49,086 --> 00:34:50,797
I CAN'T LET ANYONE ELSE KNOW

1143
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,548
I HAVE THE IDOL.

1144
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,883
I'M JUST HOPING THAT NOTHING

1145
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:56,010
GOES WRONG.

1146
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,533
Jeff: SO, COCHRAN, WHEN YOU

1147
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:19,242
WENT BACK TO CAMP AFTER THE LAST

1148
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:22,036
TRIBAL COUNCIL, YOU HAD TO BE A

1149
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:22,870
LITTLE CONCERNED BECAUSE YOU

1150
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,665
TOOK A LOT OF HEAT FOR NOT

1151
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:26,249
CONTRIBUTING.

1152
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:26,958
I'M TRYING TO MAKE MYSELF

1153
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,043
MORE OF AN ASSET TO THE TRIBE,

1154
00:35:29,126 --> 00:35:31,003
BOTH ON CAMP AND IN CHALLENGE.

1155
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,213
I THINK I PROVED TODAY THAT I AM

1156
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,965
CAPABLE IN CHALLENGES.

1157
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,883
I MEAN, I'M THE SMALLEST GUY ON

1158
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,718
THE TRIBE BUT I WAS REELING IN

1159
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:38,678
WITH THE BEST OF THEM SO I DON'T

1160
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:41,389
SEE HOW MY SIZE WAS ANY OBSTACLE

1161
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,223
OR IMPEDIMENT TO MY SUCCESS AT

1162
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:42,807
TODAY'S CHALLENGE.

1163
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,350
Jeff: COCHRAN, ARE YOU A

1164
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:44,892
LITTLE DEFENSIVE IN LIFE?

1165
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,394
I DON'T NECESSARILY FEEL

1166
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,228
THAT'S THE CASE

1167
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:51,858
( LAUGHTER ).

1168
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,776
Jeff: PAPA BEAR, WHAT'S

1169
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,402
COCHRAN'S BIGGEST PROBLEM IN

1170
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,069
THIS GAME?

1171
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:59,031
I THINK, MY OPINION -- THIS

1172
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:02,577
IS MY OPINION ONLY-- THAT

1173
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,452
PHYSICALLY, HE'S GOING TO BE A

1174
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,413
THREAT TO HIMSELF.

1175
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,040
Jeff: COCHRAN, WHERE'S THE

1176
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,418
LEADERSHIP AT ON THIS TRIBE?

1177
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,420
THERE ARE MULTIPLE LAYERS OF

1178
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,421
LEADERSHIP ON THE TRIBE.

1179
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,255
THE MOST OBVIOUS IS TO SAY OZZY

1180
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,090
IS OUR LEADER.

1181
00:36:16,173 --> 00:36:17,758
WE FOLLOW HIS LEAD IN TERMS OF

1182
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,428
LEARNING HOW TO SURVIVE THESE

1183
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,053
ELEMENTS.

1184
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,305
Jeff: PAPA BEAR, OZZY THE

1185
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:22,930
LEADER?

1186
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:23,598
EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE THE

1187
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,349
LEADER AND THIS IS A GAME WITH

1188
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,726
A-TYPE PERSONALITIES.

1189
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,436
NONE OF THESE PEOPLE HERE SIT ON

1190
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,061
THE COUCH ALL DAY.

1191
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,396
Jeff: PAPA BEAR, WHAT'S

1192
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,063
YOUR BACKGROUND PROFESSIONALLY?

1193
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,440
I'M A RETIRED NEW YORK CITY

1194
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,107
POLICE DETECTIVE.

1195
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,443
Jeff: SO YOU ARE, CLEARLY,

1196
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,110
A LEADER?

1197
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:36,777
I LIKE TO BE A LEADER, BUT

1198
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,779
FOR SOME REASON, IN THIS TEAM,

1199
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:39,614
I'M NOT A LEADER.

1200
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,283
FOR SOME REASON, THE FIVE HAS

1201
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,993
JUST TAKEN CONTROL.

1202
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,995
AND I REALLY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

1203
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:46,537
IN COMMON WITH ANY OF THEM.

1204
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,664
Jeff: DAWN, ARE YOU

1205
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,625
NOTICING PEOPLE START TO GROUP

1206
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,336
BASED ON SIMILAR LIKES OR AGE OR

1207
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:53,961
BACKGROUNDS?

1208
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,796
YEAR, I MEAN, I THINK ANY

1209
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,341
GROUP IS BASED ON SIMILARITY,

1210
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,467
KIND OF COMMUNITY.

1211
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,510
I THINK SOMETIMES PAPA BEAR,

1212
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:02,470
MYSELF, AND COCHRAN, MIGHT NOT

1213
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,513
HAVE THINGS IN COMMON.

1214
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:05,306
BUT I SEE IT SHIFTING THROUGHOUT

1215
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,015
THE DAY.

1216
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:10,019
I DON'T KNOW THAT I SEE IT AS

1217
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:10,311
LOCKED.

1218
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,354
DAWN.

1219
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,981
HE SAID YOU, ME, AND COCHRAN.

1220
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,816
THE TRUTH SWE'RE NOT IN THE

1221
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,567
FIVE.

1222
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,526
WE'RE NOT IN THEIR GROUP, ANDUN

1223
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,235
THAT.

1224
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,987
SO IT'S OKAY TO SAY IT BECAUSE

1225
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,699
IT'S REAL.

1226
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,660
Jeff: KIM, YOU'RE NOT

1227
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,327
BUYING THIS.

1228
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,662
NO, ACTUALLY, I THINK DAWN

1229
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,664
WAS RIGHT OAND I THINK PAPA BEAR

1230
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:30,790
FEELS HE'S ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK

1231
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:31,374
TONIGHT SO I REALLY THINK A LOT

1232
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,834
OF HIS COMMENT ARE REALLY

1233
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:34,669
INTENDED TO STIR THINGS UP.

1234
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:35,378
I DON'T HAVE TO STIR.

1235
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:36,504
IF I'M IN THE THREE, I DON'T

1236
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,380
HAVE TO WORRY.

1237
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,674
IF I GET VOTE OUT, I'M ONLY

1238
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:40,216
THREE.

1239
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,008
THERE'S NOT A THREE.

1240
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,802
YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT

1241
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,470
BECAUSE YOU'RE IN THE FIVE.

1242
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:47,765
Jeff: JIM, GIVEN MY THOUGHT

1243
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:48,849
ABOUT THE IDOL?

1244
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,518
WITHOUT A DOUBT.

1245
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,020
I MEAN, I SEE IT AS A VERY VERY,

1246
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,480
VERY SIGNIFICANT TOOL AN IDOL

1247
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,856
PLAYED THIS EARLY ON, FOR

1248
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,400
EXAMPLE, REALLY GIVES YOU THREE

1249
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:58,359
MORE DAYS.

1250
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:02,363
THAT IS IS WHAT "SURVIVOR" IS

1251
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,030
ALL ABOUT.

1252
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:03,656
YOU SURVIVE ONE DAY AT A TIME.

1253
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:06,033
Jeff: OZZY WERE YOU VOTED

1254
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,535
OUT HOLDING ON TO AN IDOL.

1255
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,119
YES.

1256
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:08,869
Jeff: SO WHAT JIM SAYS IT

1257
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,038
GETS YOU THREE MORE DAYS IS NOT

1258
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:11,664
NECESSARILY TRUE.

1259
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,207
YES, THIS IS POSSIBLY THAT

1260
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,500
COULD BE SOMETHING THAT COULD

1261
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,377
CHANGE THE GAME TOTALLY AND

1262
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,128
COMPLETELY.

1263
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,421
I KNOW WHENEVER SOMEONE TAKES A

1264
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:20,423
WALK YOU'RE DEFINITELY KEEPING

1265
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:21,048
YOUR EYES PEELED.

1266
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,174
Jeff: COCHRAN, YOU'RE A

1267
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:22,883
BRIGHT GUY.

1268
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:23,884
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN FIND THE

1269
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:24,176
IDOL?

1270
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:24,593
UHM.

1271
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:25,302
IT'S POSSIBLE.

1272
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:28,597
I JUST THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO

1273
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,933
WEIGH THE PROS AND CONS OF

1274
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:31,892
SEARCHING FOR THE IDOL.

1275
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,436
IT MAKES YOU LOOK VERY, VERY

1276
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,397
SUSPICIOUS AND IT MAKES YOU LOOK

1277
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,690
LIKE YOU DON'T TRUST YOUR TRIBE.

1278
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:40,067
IT'S A FOSTER OF TRUST ON THE

1279
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,527
TRIBE AND SEARCHING FOR AN

1280
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,196
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY IDOL IS NOT

1281
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,406
NECESSARILY THE BEST WAY TO

1282
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:50,745
AVOID THE CHOPPING BLOCK.

1283
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,371
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME

1284
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,914
TO VOTE.

1285
00:38:53,998 --> 00:39:03,966
ALLYCE, YOU'RE UP.

1286
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:10,598
ALLYCE, YOU'RE UP.

1287
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,058
PAPA BEAR, JUST IN CASE YOU HAVE

1288
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:22,109
THAT IDOL.

1289
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:27,281
THAT IDOL.

1290
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:27,948
Y.

1291
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,450
I THINK YOU'RE A SWEETHEART,

1292
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,243
A REALLY GREAT GUYS, BUT YOU

1293
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,287
MAKE ME ANXIOUS AND I DON'T NEED

1294
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:47,635
ANY MORE ANXIETY IN MY LIFE.

1295
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:48,427
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1296
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:57,436
VOTES.

1297
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,813
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN

1298
00:39:58,896 --> 00:39:59,522
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO

1299
00:39:59,605 --> 00:39:59,855
PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME

1300
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:09,490
TO DO SO.

1301
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,158
ALL RIGHT, ONCE THE VOTES ARE

00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,159
READ, THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1303
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:12,785
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE

1304
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,703
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

1305
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:15,996
COUNCIL IMMEDIATELY.

00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,498
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1307
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:24,004
FIRST VOTE, PAPA BEAR.

00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:24,505

ONE VOTE COCHRAN.

1310
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:28,592
JIM.

I THINK COCHRAN DESERVED TO BE

1368
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:22,957

1369
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,084

1371
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,128

1372
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,129
GOING TO GO TO THE BLUE TEAM

1373
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,464
BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING BACK TO
