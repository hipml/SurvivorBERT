...the favorites continued to

5
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,759
dominate the game, winning their

6
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,511
third challenge in a row.

7
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:12,929

8
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:14,139
bounty over here.

immunity idol on Exile Island.

11

>> I found the idol!

12
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:21,229
>> PROBST: And he replaced it

13
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,481
with a fake one as a decoy.

14
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,526
>> Do your job now, buddy.

15

>> PROBST: At Airai, Chet's

16
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,237
laziness dragged down the tribe.

17

>> I don't feel like Chet really

18
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,199
wants to carry his weight.

19
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,492
Dude, like, either pick it up or

20
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,995
go home.

target.

27
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,840
>> My mind is just spinning,

28
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:49,841
just the fact that he's still

29
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:50,842
here.

30
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,093
Chet is not in this game right

31
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,219
now.

32
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,220
He's a physical and mental

33
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,221
liability, and he's horrible for

34
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,140
morale around camp.

35
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,142

Joel...

38
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,271
>> Why you letting him call the

39
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:04,147
shots right now?

40
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:04,564
>> Am I letting him?

41
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,690
I don't know.

42
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,399
>> Yeah, you're freaking just

43
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:06,816
following like...

44
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,026
>> No, I think...

45
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:08,735
>> Like a herd of cattle down

46
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:09,235
the road.

47
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,029
>> PROBST: ...and turned his

48
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,822
attention toward Mikey B.

49
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,698
>> Mike's going to take you down

50
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:14,699
the next chance he gets because

51
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:15,492
of what you did to Mary.

52
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,242
>> I think he will, absolutely.

53
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:16,826
>> Okay, so this is his next

54
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,578
chance.

55
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,079
>> PROBST: At tribal council,

56
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,122
Jason made a plea to keep the

57
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,791
tribe strong and get rid of

58
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:23,291
Chet.

59
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,168
>> We have lost four of six

60
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,336
challenges.

61
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,379
Just take a moment to really

62
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,089
think about who we keep on the

63
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,050
island and who we let go.

64
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,092
>> PROBST: In the end...

65
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:33,802
Mike.

66
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,428
...Mikey B. was blindsided, and

67
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,304
Joel got rid of his biggest

68
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,555
rival.

69
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:41,267
Mike, the tribe has spoken.

70
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,519
Time for you to go.

71
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,561
16 are left.

72
00:01:43,645 --> 00:02:05,416
Who will be voted out tonight?

73
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,463
>> Good night.

74
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,965
>> Tonight, walking into tribal

75
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,676
council, I was hoping that our

76
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,302
tribe would make the right

77
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,596
decision to vote out Chet, the

78
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,140
weakest member of our tribe.

79
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,225
But unfortunately, that didn't

80
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:33,361
happen.

81
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,362
I'm definitely bummed that

82
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,738
Mikey's gone.

83
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,865
We need a physically strong

84
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,324
tribe.

85
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,576
I have a bad feeling that we're

86
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,243
just going to keep losing and

87
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,454
losing and losing, and I feel

88
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,875
that the tribe I'm in is not the

89
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,418
tribe I want to be in.

90
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,504
>> Another one bites the dust,

91
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,090
and it wasn't us.

92
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,842
>> Three outcasts prevailing.

93
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,636

eat Charlie the chicken.

We're hungry.

107

108
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,441
fingers getting chopped off.

109
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,818
>> Yeah, just don't chop hand.

110
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:37,735
>> Yeah, I'll hold it.

111
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,070
You chop.

112
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:39,904
>> I guess Ozzy's going to kill

113
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,990
the chicken.

114
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:42,907
Ah!

115
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:43,491
I mean, it's no... I work in

116
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,702
surgery, so it's not a big deal

117
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,828
to me.

118
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,372
But I just don't want to see a

119
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,957
dead, bloody chicken flapping

120
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,375
everywhere.

121
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,626
>> Just lay him down like this.

122
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,377
>> Good night, baby.

123
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,336
>> Good night, buddy.

124
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:55,628
Good night.

125
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,130
Sleep good.

126
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,507
>> One, two, three.

127
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,717
>> Okay.

128
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,013
>> Ah, he's bloody!

129
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,764
>> Oh, Charlie!

130
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:07,557
>> I know.

131
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,936
>> Oh, Charlie.

132
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,396
Let's go get some wood to cook

133
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,189
him.

134
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:19,444
>> We're having chicken tonight.

135
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,696
>> After the challenge, I went

136
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,115
to Exile Island, and I found the

137
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,700
hidden immunity idol.

138
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,201
It's awesome.

139
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,786
So after we killed the chicken,

140
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,412
I was slick enough that I was

141
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,040
able to hide the immunity idol

142
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:35,668
before anyone could suspect

143
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,463
otherwise.

144
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,672
At this point, I don't think I'm

145
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,798
going to show anyone the idol,

146
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,509
but I totally trust James.

147
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,641
And I think I can trust Amanda.

148
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,393
And I know I can trust Parvati.

149
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,187
Don't tell anyone, but I told

150
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:54,687
James I found the idol.

151
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,064
>> You did?

152
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:56,773
>> Yeah.

153
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,232
>> Oh, my God!

154
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:58,858
Ozzy told me he had the immunity

155
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,861
idol, and he told me, James, and

156
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,696
Parv.

157
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,156
>> No.

158
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:08,701
>> Okay, good.

159
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,870
>> So it's in our little four

160
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:11,537

161
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,497
to stay in our little four

162
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,456

163
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,540

>> Go, go, go, go!

384
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,796
>> PROBST: Eliza getting very

385
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,591
close, dragging Parvati behind

386
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,552
her.

387
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,095
30 seconds left.

388
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,890
Eliza grabs the flag from Chet.

389
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:46,891
Parvati and Eliza score the

390
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,392
first point for Airai!

391
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,060
You all right?

392
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,024
>> PROBST: Next round, it will

393
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,319
be Ami and Amanda chasing James

394
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,362
and Jason.

395
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:00,988
Tied 1-1, playing to three.

396
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,948
Survivors ready?

397
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,035
Go!

398
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,578
Ami and Amanda trying to catch

399
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,538
James and Jason.

400
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,998
They got one minute to do it.

401
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:11,832
Ami hops over, just misses a

402
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,753
shot at Jason.

403
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:16,712
>> Hold them up, guys.

404
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,047
Hold them up.

405
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,924
>> PROBST: Ami's hurt, still

406
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,967
hanging in there.

407
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,720
>> Go, go!

408
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:27,681
>> Get him!

409
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,099
>> PROBST: Oh, Jason tied up!

410
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,392
Ami has a shot at it!

411
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,020
Trying to get it!

412
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,855
Ami has Jason's flag!

413
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:41,445
Malakal leads 2-1.

414
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:41,946
Here we go, next round.

415
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,281
Jonathan Penner and Alexis

416
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,992
chasing after Cirie and Tracy.

417
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,037
Malakal leads 2-1.

418
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,789
If Cirie and Tracy can avoid

419
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,165
being caught, Malakal wins

420
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,416
reward.

421
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,335
Survivors ready?

422
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,046
Go!

423
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,089
Penner and Alexis out of the

424
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,632
gate quickly.

425
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,967
They have one minute to catch

426
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,553
Tracy and Cirie.

427
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,222
Otherwise, Malakal wins reward.

428
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,682
Penner dragging Alexis.

429
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:10,599
Cirie and Tracy doing a good

430
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,894
job, staying away.

431
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,188
Cirie dragging Tracy.

432
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,481
>> Go, go, go!

433
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,607
>> PROBST: 30 seconds left.

434
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,192
Penner reaches for the flag,

435
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,902
can't get it!

436
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,113
Alexis grabs the flag off Cirie.

437
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:28,450
We are tied 2-2.

438
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,411
Our injury tally so far-- Penner

439
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,246
has a busted up knee, Parvati

440
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,498
has a busted up lip, Ami has a

441
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,041
tweaked knee.

442
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,253
Next round, Airai is putting up

443
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,380
Parvati and Eliza.

444
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:41,964
Malakal is putting up Chet and

445
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,508
Joel.

446
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:44,925
We're tied 2-2.

447
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,595
We're playing to three.

448
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,972
Chet and Joel must catch Parvati

449
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,349
and Eliza to win reward.

450
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,144
Otherwise, Airai wins reward.

451
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,146
Here we go.

452
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,398
Survivors ready?

453
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,734
>> You got them.

454
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,569
>> PROBST: Go!

455
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,820
Parvati and Eliza just have to

456
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:06,780
avoid Joel and Chet for 60

457
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:07,781
seconds, and they'll have

458
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,199
steaks, sausage, wine and

459
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,534
fixings.

460
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,619
>> Go through, Chet.

461
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,369
Follow them.

462
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,287
>> PROBST: Joel and Chet have

463
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,788
got to catch Parvati and Eliza

464
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,291
in order to win this game.

465
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,336
Joel's got them cornered, just

466
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,254
misses the flag.

467
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,632
Parvati and Eliza are alive.

468
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,634
Joel trying to drag Chet, takes

469
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,510
a hard fall!

470
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,094
>> Come on, Chet!

471
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,139
>> PROBST: Keep moving!

472
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,599
30 seconds!

473
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,017
>> Come on!

474
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,893
>> PROBST: Joel getting

475
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,645
frustrated.

476
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,228
Parvati and Eliza have 15 more

477
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,064
seconds to avoid being caught...

478
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,524
>> Get up, let's go!

479
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,192
>> PROBST: ...for a big barbecue

480
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,444
reward!

481
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:49,990
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

482
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:54,995
five, four, three, two, one.

483
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,372
Joel and Chet cannot catch

484
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,581
Parvati and Eliza!

485
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,668
Airai wins reward!

486
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,145
>> PROBST: All right, Airai wins

487
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,647
the first challenge as new

488
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,564
tribes.

489
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,190
Nice work.

490
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,109
(<i> applause</i> )

491
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:28,487
Big reward-- steak, veggies,

492
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,988
some wine to celebrate.

493
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,115
>> Woo-hoo!

494
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:31,740
>> PROBST: Malakal, got nothing

495
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,574
for you.

496
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,200
Grab your stuff.

497
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,119
Head back to camp.

498
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,181
>> We've got a... back there,

499
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,475
there's a giant cave.

500
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,226
I'll show you guys that.

501
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,060
>> Oh, cool.

502
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:00,602
Even more than what we have.

503
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,271
>> And then we have the

504
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,230
chickens.

505
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,399
>> I'm not good about losing.

506
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,191
I know that's where my temper

507
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,192
gets to me.

508
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,069
And I'm still decompressing.

509
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,864
Maybe this is poetic justice in

510
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,073
some form, because I chose to

511
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,243
get rid of Mikey versus Chet.

512
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,287
And now here I end up with Chet

513
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,414
again on my tribe, who's

514
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,249
probably the weakest of both the

515
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,001
tribes.

516
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,419
>> Erik, are you coming?

517
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,295
>> You know, there is a little

518
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,212
bit of irony in that.

519
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,964
But at the same time, it can be

520
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,299
good to have people around that

521
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,302
ultimately will be expendable.

522
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,221
>> Oh, my god!

523
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,222
>> When it rains, this is the

524
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,098
place to be.

525
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,225
>> Yeah, it's all dry here.

526
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:40,476
>> Yeah.

527
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,727
>> Oh, this is wonderful.

528
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,936
>> It's ridiculously dry here.

529
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,521
I am so excited to be on this

530
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,773
tribe right now.

531
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:46,482
I like these people on this

532
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:46,690
tribe.

533
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,025
I mean, I got to meet Ozzy

534
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:48,233
today!

535
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,943
At this point, the game has

536
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:50,861
changed completely.

537
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,154
Now, rather than being with the

538
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,197
fans, I'm with some of the

539
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:53,489
favorites.

540
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,240
But I'm going to try and not let

541
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,450
that cloud my judgment.

542
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,576
They're still people in this

543
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,994
game.

544
00:17:59,077 --> 00:17:59,620
>> And then we use half of it as

545
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:00,913
a blanket.

546
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:01,914
We sleep on this half, and then

547
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:02,748
we pull that up.

548
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:03,373
>> You don't understand.

549
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,502
We had nothing, so...

550
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,961
>> That's why, like, you know,

551
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,880
it really sucks to lose the

552
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,298
challenge today, but it's one

553
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,341
meal.

554
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,968
It's one nice meal.

555
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:15,928
But you know, we're going to be

556
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:16,845
eating.

557
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:17,346
I feel like we do have an

558
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,263
advantage because we're on the

559
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,265
Malakal beach, and we have all

560
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,559
of the things that you need to

561
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,311
be a strong tribe.

562
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,480
>> Thank God I can hug you now.

563
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,940
>> It's just a question of are

564
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,274
we going to be a strong tribe?

565
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,276
Chet, man, he's like a sack of

566
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,237
potatoes.

567
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,364
In the challenge, he freaking

568
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,574
gave up.

569
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,034
Like, he just... he was, like,

570
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:39,701
being dragged.

571
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,702
He wouldn't even stand up.

572
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,037
I just don't see him being a

573
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,705
strong competitor at all.

574
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,957
I don't know what's going on

575
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,999
with that dude, but he needs to

576
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,126
go.

577
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,253
>> Lift up.

578
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:53,590
I've always liked chickens.

579
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,258
I've raised chickens all my

580
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,093
life, so I pretty much know

581
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:56,635
everything about chickens.

582
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,470
They're very, you know, peaceful

583
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:58,720
animals.

584
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,264
They're very placid.

585
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,348
But, you know, they have their

586
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,182
own pecking order-- literally, a

587
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,351
pecking order-- where the

588
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,687
weakest one is always basically

589
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,647
pecked on until they're killed--

590
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,816
the same as pretty much in this

591
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,693
game of<i> Survivor.</i>

592
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:13,902
The weaker one is usually pecked

593
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,028
on until they're removed from

594
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,364
the tribe.

595
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:26,790
>> Then this is where our fire

596
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,041
is.

597
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,042
So... and then we made, like, a

598
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:29,668
little...

599
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:30,419
>> So this is the shelter?

600
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,336
>> This was Chet, mine, and

601
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,504
Tracy's.

602
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,672
We build... we had to build this

603
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:34,631
one.

604
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:35,465
This slept us three, and those

605
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,928
slept seven.

606
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:40,721
>> So you guys sleep on the

607
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:41,346
beach with these things jumping

608
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,182
all over you?

609
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,474
>> Yeah, it's pretty gross.

610
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,226
>> Wow.

611
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,227
>> The Airai camp is pretty much

612
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,479
a disaster.

613
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,481
The beach is not as good as our

614
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,774
beach.

615
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,067
Kathy, move that up a little,

616
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:54,943
because the tide is starting to

617
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:55,402
come up behind you.

618
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,404
Even though winning the food

619
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,740
reward of steaks and spices and

620
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,992
wine was great, at Malakal, we

621
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,827
had everything.

622
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,078
And here, we pretty much have

623
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,538
nothing.

624
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,540
It's definitely a downgrade in

625
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,168
terms of camp life.

626
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,044
>> I'm so happy.

627
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,170
It's nice to have things kind of

628
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,212
shaken up.

629
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,505
So it's good to get to know more

630
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,549
people.

631
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,343
>> Whoa!

632
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,260
Not good.

633
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:20,886
>> Can it get up that high that

634
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,721
it's going to put our fire out?

635
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,181
>> Yeah.

636
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,057
>> The water hasn't come into

637
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,974
your shelter, has it?

638
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,517
>> Not yet.

639
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,602
>> Oh, just to hear that

640
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,688
sizzling sound is great!

641
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:32,731
>> So good right now!

642
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:33,899
>> Oh, my gosh.

643
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,317
Here comes the water.

644
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,027
>> Ah!

645
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,820
>> No.

646
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:39,947
No, it did not.

647
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,031
>> No, it didn't.

648
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:41,823
It did?

649
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:42,783
No.

650
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,493
>> The old Airai, the setup that

651
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,452
they were living in was

652
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,662
terrible.

653
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,913
The waters are washing away the

654
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,331
fire, you know.

655
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,332
I'm amazed that they're still

656
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,708
alive, poor things.

657
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,417
They should be dead.

658
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,753
I mean, they're a bunch of

659
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:55,504
dingbats.

660
00:20:55,587 --> 00:21:00,008
More wood, huh?

661
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,218
>> It went really deep.

662
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,095
>> Yeah.

663
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,096
Oh.

664
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:04,805
>> Well, my knee's a little

665
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:05,847
screwy.

666
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,099
I was on the course in the

667
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,392
challenge, punctured it somehow.

668
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:11,812
There was some sharp something,

669
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,356
went right into my muscle.

670
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,650
A lot of people got fat lips and

671
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:17,859
twisted knees and stuff like

672
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,361
that, and I found a stick, and

673
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:23,657
it went straight into my leg.

674
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,492
I'm gimping around like I'm

675
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:28,662
Quasimoto.

676
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,163
It's painfully sore.

677
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:30,789
I really tweaked the hell out of

678
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:33,750
it.

679
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:45,387
Oh.

680
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,847
It's not too late to suture,

681
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,514
right?

682
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:51,935
It's all right?

683
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,395
And... and... argh!

684
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,648
Ah!

685
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,072
>> A little one again.

686
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,158
>> Ow!

687
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,826
Damn it!

688
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,996
Ah.

689
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,790
It hurts!

690
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,510
>> Ow!

691
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,804
God!

692
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,973
It's crazy!

693
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:30,599
I'm in the middle of the

694
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,018
freaking jungle.

695
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,519
A wonderful doctor came out to

696
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,855
the beach and cleaned my wound

697
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,857
and stitched it up, and they

698
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,484
left me with three stitches and

699
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,195
a painful leg.

700
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,696
>> He's going to live.

701
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,864
>> Are you all right then?

702
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,532
>> Oh, I'm fine.

703
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,743
There could be an infection, and

704
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,119
it could work down towards the

705
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,621
joint of my knee.

706
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,623
So let's hope it doesn't get

707
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,875
worse.

708
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,540
>> Ozzy is amazing.

709
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,542
The kid can swim like crazy.

710
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,544
He's natural in the water.

711
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:41,503
That's just... that's just how

712
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,296
he was born, and there's nothing

713
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:43,755
to it other than that.

714
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,423
I mean, I can't compete with

715
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:45,590
him.

716
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:49,469
He's amazing.

717
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,554
>> We are in a really good

718
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:53,306
position over here, because I

719
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,432
think we have a really strong

720
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,892
tribe, aside from maybe one

721
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:56,518
person.

722
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,519
>> Yeah.

723
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,520
>> What are you thinking?

724
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,355
>> You're obviously thinking

725
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:01,022
something.

726
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,816
>> I'm just thinking Chet, and

727
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,193
then after that, between Tracy

728
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,736
and Cirie, which, I mean, I

729
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,821
don't know.

730
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:08,613
>> I'll tell you what.

731
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,407
If you're willing to get rid of

732
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,700
Cirie first, I got no problem

733
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,660
giving up Chet and then being

734
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:18,123
back to 3-3, calling that fair.

735
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:18,957
>> After we were out on the

736
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,000
water, we had a little

737
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,084
conversation on the beach

738
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,044
between mainly Joel and Ozzy,

739
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,379
and I kind of listened in.

740
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,131
And it was kind of like two

741
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,592
superpowers kind of discussing

742
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,844
terms.

743
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,095
>> You know, being completely

744
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,680
legitimate, our concern is that

745
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:34,890
there's four from the favorites

746
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,057
and four from the fans, and the

747
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,017
first one to go down to three is

748
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,018
kind of...

749
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:38,894
>> Screwed.

750
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:39,644
>> You know, unless something

751
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,396
changes.

752
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:42,105
>> Well, if we can trust each

753
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:42,731
other...

754
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:43,356
>> Unless there's some level of

755
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,984
trust somewhere.

756
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:46,568
I think it is, to a degree,

757
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,570
still fans versus favorites, but

758
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,615
either the favorites have to

759
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,325
swing a fan over to their side,

760
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,492
or the fans have to swing a

761
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,619
favorite over to their side.

762
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:56,203
Somebody's going to have to

763
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,872
flip.

764
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:11,968
>> So if we build our day camp

765
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,595
at the other end of the beach,

766
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,847
we can build a camp for all

767
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,724
eight of us to sleep together.

768
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,310
>> Let's do it!

769
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:20,936
>> When we woke up this morning,

770
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,646
it was the first priority to

771
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:23,939
find a new location for the new

772
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,483
shelter.

773
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,859
>> Is this too far?

774
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:28,735
>> No.

775
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:29,694
I mean, I'd say this is the best

776
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,154
place to build something.

777
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,155
>> Yeah, I think is...

778
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,531
>> To have four new people with

779
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,574
so much experience under their

780
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,034
belt, being able to point at

781
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:36,910
this and say, "We need to do

782
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:37,786
this, and we need to do this,

783
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,037
and this is how we did this," I

784
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,331
mean, it's unbelievable.

785
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:42,958
>> We need two posts.

786
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,460
We'll have the front this way.

787
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:54,219
>> With our new tribe, this got

788
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,721
erected in an hour.

789
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,056
The new members of Airai, I

790
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:58,848
mean, they're just on it.

791
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,016
They're quick.

792
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,934
They're making it happen.

793
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,102
It's getting done.

794
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,979
And it's brilliant.

795
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,397
>> It's so refreshing to have

796
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,189
new people here.

797
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:06,815
I know you all are sad to miss

798
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,359
your cave and all that, but I

799
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:10,318
can't tell you how nice it is

800
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,361
for us.

801
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:12,821
>> Yeah, I understand that.

802
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,380
>> What'd you get?

803
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,840
>> Oh, my god!

804
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:32,757
>> What is it?

805
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:33,133
>> A huge shark.

806
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:33,842
>> Shark!

807
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,052
>> Ozzy!

808
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,304
>> Ozzy!

809
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,805
>> A big shark dead in the net?

810
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:39,014
>> Yeah.

811
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,473
That's why we have to keep the

812
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:41,099
net clean, because the sharks...

813
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,809
>> Ozzy!

814
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:43,727
>> It's huge, huh?

815
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,145
>> When I went over to the net,

816
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:45,854
I looked down, and there was

817
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,398
this huge white thing.

818
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,774
And I'm like, "Oh, my God."

819
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:50,317
>> That's, like, 40 pounds

820
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,359
maybe.

821
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:51,901
>> 40 pounds?

822
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,194
>> Yeah, 35, 40 pounds.

823
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:53,778
>> It was huge.

824
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:54,821
What am I going to do?

825
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:55,655
I'm from Montana.

826
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,991
We don't have sharks in Montana.

827
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:01,995
>> Oh, my God!

828
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:02,954
>> Isn't that freaky?

829
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,664
>> I mean, damn, Amanda, she

830
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,499
basically wrestled a four-foot

831
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,001
shark by herself.

832
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,502
I mean, that's pretty attractive

833
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:13,048
to a guy like me.

834
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:13,882
>> It's so juicy.

835
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,050
>> It's so juicy.

836
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,384
Oh, my God!

837
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,844
>> I'll take this over beefsteak

838
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,512
any time.

839
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,474
Best eating in over 13 days.

840
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,308
>> If it makes you guys feel

841
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,142
better, it's the best eating for

842
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,143
us, too.

843
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:25,977
>> That does make me feel

844
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:26,978
better.

845
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,189
>> That was an amazing meal.

846
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:29,856
Now we just want to kick ass.

847
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:32,525
We just want to start winning.

848
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,861
>> Oh, my God!

849
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:48,625
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

850
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:49,626
to today's challenge?

851
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:50,335
>> Yeah.

852
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:51,252
>> PROBST: First things first.

853
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,798
Ami, take back immunity.

854
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:55,840
Once again, immunity is back up

855
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,468
for grabs.

856
00:27:58,551 --> 00:27:59,052
For today's challenge, four

857
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,970
members from each tribe will

858
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,597
alternate throwing rocks at

859
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,140
ceramic tiles.

860
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,558
Each time you break a tile, you

861
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:06,101
release a bundle of wooden

862
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,977
puzzle pieces.

863
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,229
Once you've collected all four

864
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,106
bundles, three tribe members

865
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:11,856
will assemble the puzzle with

866
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,900
the help from a caller on top of

867
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,360
a tower.

868
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:16,986
The edges of each puzzle piece

869
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,571
must match the color of the

870
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,156
piece next to it, which means

871
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:20,782
black must line up with black,

872
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,576
purple with purple, orange with

873
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,911
orange.

874
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:25,954
If it doesn't line up, you don't

875
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,247
have it right.

876
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,832
First tribe to solve the puzzle

877
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,668
correctly wins immunity; losers,

878
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,002
tribal council, somebody going

879
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:33,920
home.

880
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:34,921
Give you a minute to strategize,

881
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:38,758
and we'll get started.

882
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,760
Here we go, for immunity.

883
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,304
Survivors ready?

884
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,180
Go!

885
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:44,848
>> Come on, guys.

886
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:45,265
>> Come on, James.

887
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,474
>> PROBST: Throwing rocks to

888
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,100
break tiles.

889
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,518
>> Come on, Ozzy.

890
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,352
>> PROBST: Ozzy connects and

891
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,228
breaks the first tile for

892
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,896
Malakal.

893
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,939
>> Almost, almost.

894
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:53,940
>> Come on, Tracy!

895
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:54,315
>> Come on, Tracy.

896
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,692
>> You got it.

897
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:56,484
>> Take your time.

898
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,360
>> Nice!

899
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,278
>> PROBST: Tracy breaks a tile

900
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:58,987
for Malakal.

901
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,990
Penner breaks a tile for Airai.

902
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:08,872
James smashes a tile but not

903
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:09,914
enough.

904
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,124
>> Oh, that sucks!

905
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,083
Come on!

906
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:12,542
>> PROBST: You have to

907
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:13,793
obliterate that tile to get the

908
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,253
rope to drop.

909
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:15,837
Erik breaks a third tile for

910
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,424
Malakal.

911
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,258
>> Keep going, keep going.

912
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,552
Quickly, guys, quickly.

913
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:23,803
>> PROBST: Malakal only has one

914
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,306
tile left to break.

915
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:27,390
>> Pick it up.

916
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,183
Let's pick it up.

917
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:28,349
Yes!

918
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:28,975
>> PROBST: James breaks another

919
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,768
tile, but it doesn't drop.

920
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:31,978
Got to smash all the way

921
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,813
through.

922
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:34,814
Jason breaks a tile for Airai.

923
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,733
>> Come on, smash those, smash

924
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,735
those, quickly, guys, quickly.

925
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:39,694
>> PROBST: Erik drops the fourth

926
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:40,111
tile for Malakal.

927
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,654
>> Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry,

928
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:42,322
hurry.

929
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:42,906
>> Bull!

930
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:43,823
We say bull, bull, bull!

931
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,658
>> PROBST: Penner, you got the

932
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,495
same tiles, the same ropes.

933
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,120
>> They've got a knot we've got

934
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:49,913
to untie.

935
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:52,499
Here, let me untie it.

936
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:53,583
>> Purple and then pink.

937
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:54,375
>> Right there, it's right

938
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,126
there.

939
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,004
Put that one in there.

940
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:00,798
>> I mean, my ass!

941
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,759
>> What?

942
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:03,635
>> PROBST: Airai, you need to

943
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:04,427
stop bitching and start

944
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,261
throwing.

945
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,012
>> Just hitting them as hard as

946
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,889
we can, Jeff.

947
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,682
>> There you go.

948
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:10,433
Okay, there, there.

949
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,184
>> PROBST: Malakal working on

950
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,018
their puzzle already.

951
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,269
>> Like that, like that, like

952
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,063
that.

953
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:15,855
>> Yeah!

954
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,565
>> PROBST: Airai drops their

955
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,608
third tile.

956
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,860
One left.

957
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,905
Jason gets it down!

958
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:24,489
Airai collecting their puzzle

959
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:25,907
pieces.

960
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,407
>> Pull them, pull them!

961
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,825
Quick, quick, quick!

962
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:28,409
They're not close.

963
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,202
We can get this.

964
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:29,953
>> That's not it.

965
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:30,495
>> Something's wrong here.

966
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:31,454
>> That's not it.

967
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:31,996
That's not it.

968
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,747
>> White, white.

969
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,414
Just look at it.

970
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,332
>> PROBST: All colors much match

971
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,875
up along the frame and with

972
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,044
other pieces of tile.

973
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,837
>> That piece is wrong right

974
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:40,046
here.

975
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,047
>> No, no, it's pink right here,

976
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,090
pink right here.

977
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:42,882
>> We got to get the corner

978
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,759
pieces.

979
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:45,468
We need a yellow with an orange

980
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,010
on that one.

981
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,011
>> PROBST: Eliza calling the

982
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,055
shots for Airai.

983
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:49,430
>> The other way.

984
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,682
The white has to touch the

985
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:51,224
white.

986
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:51,891
Yeah, bottom.

987
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:52,433
>> PROBST: Chet calling the

988
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,269
shots for Malakal.

989
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,103
>> That white right there

990
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,187
shouldn't just, like, end that

991
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,188
way.

992
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:57,772
>> I think that one has to be

993
00:30:57,855 --> 00:30:58,106
the corner.

994
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,691
Take that one and put it here,

995
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:00,567
Parv.

996
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,276
>> PROBST: Airai made up a lot

997
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,151
of time.

998
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,027
We are dead even right now.

999
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:03,987
>> That piece is wrong.

1000
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,988
These black ones need to go to

1001
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,781
that corner.

1002
00:31:06,864 --> 00:31:07,782
>> That piece isn't going to fit

1003
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:08,408
in there.

1004
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,075
>> No, it will.

1005
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:09,617
Keep that white one there.

1006
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,785
>> PROBST: Joel getting very

1007
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:11,286
involved in this puzzle.

1008
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,704
>> You know what, Eliza?

1009
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:13,413
See if you can see the big

1010
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:14,372
picture.

1011
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,623
There's got to be a bigger

1012
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,292
pattern to it.

1013
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,876
>> It's a black and white

1014
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,628
zigzag-- black on this side,

1015
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,338
white on this side.

1016
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,006
>> Parv, give her the one in

1017
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:23,298
your hand.

1018
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:23,965
Yeah, put that there.

1019
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,883
>> Yes, now you're on to

1020
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:26,926
something.

1021
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:27,552
>> PROBST: Airai thinks they're

1022
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,304
getting closer.

1023
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:29,929
>> This piece here has to come

1024
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:30,680
out.

1025
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:31,222
Yes, take that out.

1026
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,390
>> No, that one's right, Cirie.

1027
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,224
>> Okay, I think we got it.

1028
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:33,933
>> There we go.

1029
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:34,183
That's it.

1030
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,476
>> We're done.

1031
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,060
>> Oh, my god, we got it.

1032
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,979
We got it, we got it, we got it!

1033
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,523
Oh, my God.

1034
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,275
>> PROBST: Airai wins immunity!

1035
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:46,946
(<i> cheering</i> )

1036
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:52,160
>> Comeback, baby!

1037
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,828
>> PROBST: Airai, immunity.

1038
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:57,123
(<i> applause</i> )

1039
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:58,666
Nobody going home.

1040
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,209
Malakal, tribal council tonight.

1041
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,669
One of you will be voted out.

1042
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:02,295
You have the afternoon to figure

1043
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:02,962
out who it's going to be.

1044
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,589
I'll see you at tribal.

1045
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:05,214
Grab your stuff.

1046
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,467
Head back to camp.

1047
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,154
>> We lost the challenge, and

1048
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,989
for me, this is what, five, six

1049
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,408
losses in a row?

1050
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:36,371
I mean, I stopped counting.

1051
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,122
>> Oh!

1052
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,582
>> At this point, I don't know

1053
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,875
if it can be a fans versus

1054
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:42,251
favorites anymore, unless we

1055
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:47,256
want to really just keep losing.

1056
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:47,465
So...

1057
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,050
>> Yeah.

1058
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,510
>> I could care less about how

1059
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,552
the numbers dwindle away.

1060
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,720
>> I really could care less as

1061
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:53,763
well.

1062
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,557
I think Chet's our priority.

1063
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,892
>> Just doing the right thing,

1064
00:32:57,975 --> 00:32:58,643
and the right thing is to get

1065
00:32:58,726 --> 00:32:59,352
rid of the weak.

1066
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:00,478
This game is a game for strong

1067
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,314
people, and we need to keep it

1068
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:08,361
that way.

1069
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:09,862
I don't think I've ever, in my

1070
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,782
life, interacted with somebody

1071
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:16,869
that is so just spineless.

1072
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,079
>> Clean your coop out later.

1073
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:21,541
>> It's almost like he's a wet

1074
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:26,170
rag or a ball of goo.

1075
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,588
There's absolutely zero honor

1076
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,214
whatsoever in keeping somebody

1077
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,049
like that on our team.

1078
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,510
I mean, if you went back to

1079
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:33,261
medieval times, I think we'd

1080
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:37,515
kill him ourselves.

1081
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,349
You can only ever play the hand

1082
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,600
you're dealt, right, Oz?

1083
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,019
>> Yeah.

1084
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:42,854
>> Play it to the best of your

1085
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,147
ability and get rid of the cards

1086
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,898
that aren't working for you, and

1087
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:46,816
I think we got a couple cards

1088
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,067
that aren't working for us.

1089
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,903
>> What do you think?

1090
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:55,450
>> Yeah?

1091
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,326
>> That's my thought.

1092
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,876
>> I know.

1093
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,002
>> You want a drink of this?

1094
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:08,755
>> Yeah, I do.

1095
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,969
>> I think we should make our

1096
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:15,595
team the strongest.

1097
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:16,387
>> I think so, too.

1098
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,096
I definitely think so.

1099
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,015
>> Uh-huh.

1100
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:22,101
>> Okay.

1101
00:34:25,062 --> 00:34:26,898
>> Erik seems to think that we

1102
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,191
should get rid of the weaker

1103
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:31,402
players in the tribe, which

1104
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,155
would be fine with me, except

1105
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,323
I'm included in the weaker tribe

1106
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:39,118
members.

1107
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,912
>> We lost that challenge today

1108
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:41,329
because of him.

1109
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,456
>> See, I can't see...

1110
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:44,665
>> I could see it, and you girls

1111
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:45,708
were right.

1112
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:46,501
He could have moved on, but he

1113
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,502
was like, "Get it out of there!

1114
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,252
Get it out of there!"

1115
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:51,172
Joel, it was his fault today.

1116
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,636
>> Chet is viewed as one of the

1117
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,471
weaker players, but at the same

1118
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,681
time, Joel didn't help his own

1119
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,433
team win, and he didn't help us

1120
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,977
win today.

1121
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,525
>> Right now, I have to convince

1122
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,193
Ozzy and Amanda that Joel is a

1123
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,778
bigger threat for us than Chet

1124
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,321
is.

1125
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,659
>> ...then we'll have Joel.

1126
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,035
We'll still have the numbers.

1127
00:35:21,118 --> 00:35:21,577
We'll be able to win reward.

1128
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,328
We'll be able to decide who to

1129
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,455
send to Exile.

1130
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,458
>> You think Joel is really that

1131
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,209
great helping us win?

1132
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,837
He didn't help us win today.

1133
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,255
He didn't hit one tile.

1134
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:32,630
Big as he is...

1135
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:33,965
>> That's true.

1136
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:34,549
>> ...he should have hit

1137
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,633
something.

1138
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,009
Tracy is, like, this big and hit

1139
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,427
more tiles than he did.

1140
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:38,719
>> I know.

1141
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,137
>> He didn't do nothing but

1142
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,305
screw us up in the puzzle.

1143
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,306
>> Like, I mean, he's still,

1144
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,891
like, a mover and a shaker.

1145
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,601
Chet's nothing and a nothing.

1146
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,228
>> But Joel is already playing

1147
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:47,478
the game.

1148
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,397
Chet ain't really into playing

1149
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,773
the game like that.

1150
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,316
There are so many pluses for

1151
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,694
getting rid of Joel, and Chet is

1152
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:55,903
just like a pawn.

1153
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,154
We can use Chet for whatever we

1154
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,447
need whenever we need.

1155
00:35:58,531 --> 00:35:58,823
>> That's true.

1156
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,199
>> Joel you can't do that with.

1157
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,450
>> That makes sense.

1158
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,910
This is an incredibly important

1159
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:03,786
vote tonight.

1160
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,371
We are at a crossroads.

1161
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,748
We are at a point where we need

1162
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,332
to decide how we're going to

1163
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,043
approach the rest of the game.

1164
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,336
Chet, in challenges, he is a

1165
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,547
waste of space.

1166
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,882
On the other hand, Joel wants to

1167
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:16,465
win challenges, but Joel wants

1168
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,385
to win the game really bad, and

1169
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:21,429
Joel is dangerous.

1170
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,931
It's a hard decision.

1171
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,286
>> PROBST: So let's talk about

1172
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,245
the switch.

1173
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,080
Ozzy, you and Natalie were

1174
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,415
selected as captains.

1175
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,708
Natalie had the first choice,

1176
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:51,292
immediately took James.

1177
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,794
You countered with Joel.

1178
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,046
Was that to match up size for

1179
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,088
size?

1180
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,173
>> Yeah.

1181
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:57,798
It just seemed like the logical

1182
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,759
choice at the time to try and

1183
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,052
match James's strength with

1184
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:02,303
Joel's.

1185
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,180
>> PROBST: On the flip side,

1186
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:04,805
Chet, you really weren't even

1187
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,390
picked.

1188
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,100
You were left over and ended up

1189
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:08,434
on this tribe.

1190
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:10,394
Does that work on your psyche at

1191
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,646
all about where you fit in this

1192
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,480
game?

1193
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,398
>> Um, you know, I felt like I

1194
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,608
was in trouble from day one in

1195
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,317
this game, but I'm still sitting

1196
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,277
here.

1197
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,528
And of course, it's not the

1198
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,488
greatest to be picked last, but

1199
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,323
that was the group of people I

1200
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,324
wanted to end up with, whether

1201
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,992
they chose me or whether I went

1202
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:25,618
there by default, so I was very

1203
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,286
happy with the results, no

1204
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,537
matter what.

1205
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,997
>> PROBST: Tracy, let's talk

1206
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,415
about the challenge where you

1207
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,500
were dragging each other through

1208
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,960
the mud.

1209
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:34,961
It was your first time together

1210
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:35,920
as a new group.

1211
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,004
What do you think?

1212
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:37,588
>> I think that watching Joel

1213
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,174
and Chet, if there had just been

1214
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:41,467
a smidgen of communication for

1215
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,510
the guy he was dragging around

1216
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,804
behind him, then we almost would

1217
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:45,346
have had it.

1218
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,598
If somebody with you can't walk

1219
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,808
or gets their head whopped

1220
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:50,101
against a board and they can't

1221
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,811
see, putting your feet down and

1222
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:52,395
pulling like a Clydesdale, you

1223
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,230
know, is just not going to get

1224
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,314
it done.

1225
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:55,856
>> PROBST: Joel, obviously,

1226
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,482
Tracy's talking about you and

1227
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:57,358
the way you were dragging Chet

1228
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,401
around like he was a bundle of

1229
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,361
bananas.

1230
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,071
>> Yeah.

1231
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,447
What do you want me to say?

1232
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,490
There was communication.

1233
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,575
If I was going under, I said,

1234
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:07,451
"Under."

1235
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,411
If I was going through, I said,

1236
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,620
"Through."

1237
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:10,579
Don't shake your head.

1238
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,622
If I was going over, I said,

1239
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,915
"Over."

1240
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:13,749
If he couldn't hear me because

1241
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:14,834
there was mud in his ears from

1242
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:15,960
being dragged through it, it's

1243
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,503
not my fault.

1244
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:18,379
>> PROBST: Chet, what was your

1245
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,798
experience being the one behind,

1246
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,091
being dragged?

1247
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:22,717
>> First off, I felt like I was

1248
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,885
harnessed to a Mack truck and

1249
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,220
drug through the forest.

1250
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:27,346
And when somebody is making up

1251
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,931
their mind in a split second,

1252
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,057
you do end up getting smashed

1253
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:30,975
into posts.

1254
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,018
And there wasn't as much

1255
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,978
communication in the last aspect

1256
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,187
of that challenge for us as

1257
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:35,980
there was in the beginning for

1258
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,690
us.

1259
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:38,816
>> PROBST: Erik, tonight's vote,

1260
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,067
is this about keeping a tribe

1261
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:40,568
strong so we can win in

1262
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,195
challenges, or is it four fans,

1263
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:43,821
four favorites, somebody's going

1264
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,406
to win out?

1265
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,615
>> When you bring the two groups

1266
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,159
together, there is that initial

1267
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,410
thought, the fans versus the

1268
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,828
favorites still.

1269
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,413
But at this point, I think most

1270
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,040
of us are looking at this as we

1271
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:54,582
just need to stay strong.

1272
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,209
>> PROBST: All right, it is time

1273
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,128
to vote.

1274
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,964
Erik, you're up.

1275
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,891
>> I'm voting for Chet tonight.

1276
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:12,767
We want to stay strong as a

1277
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,603
tribe, and take it easy.

1278
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:37,792
>> This is because you called me

1279
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,669
weak one too many times.

1280
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:00,815
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1281
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,526
votes.

1282
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:10,533
If anybody has the hidden

1283
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:11,492
immunity idol and you want to

1284
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,910
play it, now would be the time

1285
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:15,538
to do so.

1286
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:16,455
Okay.

1287
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,207
Once the votes are read, the

1288
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,083
decision is final.

1289
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:19,875
The person voted out will be

1290
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:20,626
asked to leave the tribal

1291
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:21,836
council area immediately.

1292
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:25,798
I'll read the votes.

1293
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:28,134
First vote, Joel.

1294
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:31,887
Chet.

1295
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,390
One vote Joel, one vote Chet.

1296
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:36,934
Chet.

1297
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,353
Two votes Chet, one vote Joel.

1298
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:42,815
Joel.

1299
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:45,818
Two vote Joel, two votes Chet.

1300
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,156
Joel.

1301
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:50,990
That's three votes Joel, two

1302
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:53,534
votes Chet.

1303
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,079
Joel.

1304
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,414
That's four votes Joel, two

1305
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:01,041
votes Chet.

1306
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:05,880
Fifth person voted out of

1307
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,840
<i>Survivor: Fans vs. Favorites,</i>

1308
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,383
Joel.

1309
00:41:09,466 --> 00:41:09,884
That's five.

1310
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:10,509
That's enough.

1311
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:14,722
You need to bring me your torch.

1312
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,724
>> Hey, big guy.

1313
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:24,148
>> PROBST: Joel, the tribe has

1314
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:27,318
spoken.

1315
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:30,404
Time for you to go.

1316
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,703
>> Wow.

1317
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,375
>> PROBST: Well, tonight's vote

1318
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,835
established what is important to

1319
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,795
this tribe, and clearly,

1320
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,297
physical strength, not at the

1321
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,548
top of the list.

1322
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:50,507
Certainly caught Joel by

1323

Wow.

1353
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:47,106
I don't understand why you would

1354

wring a couple people's necks

00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:55,531
