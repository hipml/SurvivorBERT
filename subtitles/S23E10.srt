I.

61
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,562
JIM IS THE MOST DANGEROUS

62
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,564
KIND OF PERSON BECAUSE TO YOUR

63
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,649

00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,442
LIKE THE BEST FRIEND OF

00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,109
EVERYBODY.

66
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:16,988
WHEN THE CHIPS ARE DOWN HE

67
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:17,530
WOULDN'T DO IT -- THAT'S THE

68
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,323
WORST KIND OF GUY.

69
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,658
NOW THAT HE'S GONE WE'RE GOING

70
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,452

THAT IS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE

77
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,128
ALLIANCE BETTER NOT FEEL LIKE

78
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,589
THEY'RE ON THE BOTTOM OR
THEY'RE

79
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:35,924

FACT MORE BLIND SIDES HAPPEN

87
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,268

I DON'T DICTATE ANYTHING.

91
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,148
I NEVER TELL THESE GUYS WHO TO

92
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:52,899
DO.

93
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:53,650
WE ALL MAKE SUGGESTIONS, IT'S

94
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,317
EQUAL.

00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:57,487
LIKE HE'S JESUS.

97
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,238
ALL OF THEM THINK THAT THEY'RE

98
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,491
GOING TO GO TO THE END,

99
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,327
OBVIOUSLY SEVEN CAN'T GO TO THE

100
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,036

I'M IN CONTROL OF THE GAME, I'M

149
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,200

163
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,226

CONCERNED

165
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,520

HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

283
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:09,538
I GOT TO SAY BEING ALONE ON

284
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,874
REDEMPTION IS A BEAUTIFUL
THING.

285
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,709
I'VE REALLY SCORED OUT HERE.

286
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,794
LIKE MY MINI PARADISE.

287
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:16,879
I'VE GOT ALL THAT I COULD EVER

288
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,464
WANT IN FOOD.

289
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,509
ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL REEFS

290
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:26,055
FULL OF CAVS.

291
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:30,017
I'M REALLY GLAD THAT TE TUNA

292
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,101
TRIBE IS MISSING MY SKILLS.

293
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,728
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL NOBODY IS

294
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,897
ABLE TO GET OUT THERE AND GO

295
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,648
FISHING.

296
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,899
BECAUSE THEY GOT TO SPEND A LOT

297
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,526
OF THEIR ENERGY WATCHING OUT,

298
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,860
WHO IS DOING WHAT AND WHERE

299
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,654
PEOPLE ARE GOING AND WHO PEOPLE

300
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:42,404
ARE TALKING TO.

301
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,031
THEY GOT TO WATCH OUT FOR THE

302
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:44,740
COULD NOTIFYING NATURE THAT IS

303
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:48,244
THE NORMAL CLASSIC END GAME OF

304
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:55,584
"SURVIVOR".

305
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,919
REDEMPTION ADDS A WHOLE NEW

306
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:57,670
TWIST.

307
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:58,546
YOU HAVE THE SKILLS AND ABILITY

308
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:59,755
LIKE I DO, YOU CAN COME OUT
HERE

309
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,591
AND REALLY REFRESH, REJUVENATE

310
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,260
GET EVERYTHING SET TO GO AND

311
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,470
PLAY THE END GAME WITH A
PASSION

312
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,597
AND A FEROCITY THAT YOU CAN'T

313
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,474
GET WHEN YOU'RE HAVING TO DEAL

314
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,059
WITH A TRIBE.

315
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,937
I THINK IT'S THAT DUEL PROVES

316
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,773
THAT I'M A HUGE PHYSICAL THREAT

317
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:18,607
STILL.

318
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,483
AND IF ANYTHING I'VE JUST
GOTTEN

319
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,486
STRONGER SINCE BEING OUT HERE
ON

320
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,153
REDEMPTION.

321
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,281
AND THE NEXT COUPLE PEOPLE

322
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,615
COMING THROUGH REDEMPTION ARE

323
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,117
GOING TO HAVE A BIG CHALLENGE
IN

324
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,993
FRONT OF THEM.

325
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:32,746
AND THAT'S ME.

326
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:59,064
NOTHING, HUH?

327
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,610
I JEOPARDIZED MY OWN GAME

328
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,654
AND DIDN'T OUT YOUR GAME PLAN.

329
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,488
WHEN OUR GROUP COULD HAVE SHOOK

330
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,072
IT UP.

331
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,658
I FEEL LIKE YOU COULD

332
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,492
RECIPROCATE.

333
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:16,999
I'LL DO ANYTHING TO STAY IN
NOW.

334
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,959
YOU'RE STILL THE NUMBER ONE

335
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:19,668
PERSON ON THE LIST.

336
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,378
THERE'S SOMETHING APPEALING

337
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,172
ABOUT THE IDEA OF RETURNING TO

338
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,006
DAWN AND WHITNEY.

339
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,507
THEY KNOW IT'S GOING TO

340
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,217
BASICALLY HAVE TO BE THE ACT OF

341
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,219
AN ANGEL LOOKING OVER THEM TO

342
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,346
CARRY THEM FURTHER.

343
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,139
I THINK IF I WERE THAT ANGEL

344
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,349
THAT WOULD PROBABLY EARN ME A

345
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,018
LOT MORE JURY VOTES THAN JUST

346
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,853
BLINDLY FOLLOWING THE UPOLU.

347
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:40,022
I'M WILLING TO CHANGE --

348
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:40,731
YEAH.

349
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:46,028
I GET IT.

350
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,696
EITHER WAY IT'S GOING TO BE

351
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,405
A LEAP OF FAITH.

352
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,991
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TRUST THAT

353
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:51,700
THE FEW PROMISES I HAVE
RECEIVED

354
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,869
TO TAKE ME FURTHER THAN 7th

355
00:15:53,952 --> 00:15:55,913
PLACE HAVE BEEN SINCERE OR IF I

356
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,581
REALLY AM 7th IN LINE I GOT

357
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,290
MAKE A BIG MOVE.

358
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,542
THIS IS SOMETHING I NEED TO

359
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:07,049
SERIOUSLY CONSIDER.

360
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:16,183
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

NOT GOING TO HELP ME AT ALL,

NOPE.

368
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,571
I DON'T WANT TO LET GO OF IT.

FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU WILL

372
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,537

EVERYBODY ELSE STRUGGLING.

IT IS OVERFLOWING.

448
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,254
SOPHIE HAS MORE RICIN HER BOWL

449
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,547
THAN ANYBODY ELSE HAS TAKEN AT

450
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,256
ONE TIME.

451
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,424
THAT THING IS FILLED TO THE

452
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,049
BRIM.

453
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,594
THAT COULD BE ENOUGH.

00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,636
BRANDON WITH ANOTHER BOWL OF

455
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,596
RICE.

456
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,431
WILL THAT DO IT?

457
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,516
NO.

458
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,269
DAWN WITH ANOTHER BOWL OF RICE.

459
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,896
SHE'S CLOSE.

460
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:53,650

461
00:19:53,734 --> 00:20:02,242
SOPHIE WITH THAT WINS IMMUNITY!

462
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:07,456

SOPHIE, COME ON OVER.

464
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:10,834
[ Applause ]

465
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,085
GOOD JOB, SOPHIE.

466
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,296
SO PROUD OF YOU.

467
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,964
NICE JOB.

468
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,633
Jeff: SOPHIE IS SAFE AT

469
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,342
TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL.

470
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,303
ONE STEP CLOSER TO GETTING TO

471
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,179
THE END.

472
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:25,474
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, TONIGHT A
TWIST

473
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,309
OF TRIBAL COUNCIL WHICH WILL BE

474
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,479
REVEALED AT TRIBAL.

475
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,939
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

476
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,815
WHITNEY AND I ARE ON THE

477
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:34,566
OUT.

478
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:34,900
WE HAD TO WIN THE CHALLENGE FOR

479
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,652
SURE.

480
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,654
BUT I HAVEN'T LOST HOPE.

481
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,613
JEFF SAID TRIBAL COUNCIL THERE

482
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:40,864
WILL BE A TWIST.

483
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,491
SO I THINK IF THIS ISN'T THE

484
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,825
TIME TO GET UP BECAUSE ANYTHING

485
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,954
CAN HAPPEN.

486
00:20:55,587 --> 00:21:09,810
GOOD JOB, GUYS.

487
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:10,602
I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH MY

488
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,563
PERFORMANCE IN TODAY'S IMMUNITY

489
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:14,690
CHALLENGE, I THOUGHT THERE WAS
A

490
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,565
CHANCE I WOULD EXCEL.

491
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,318
AGAIN MY LACK OF BALANCE AND

492
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,530
AGILITY CAME BACK TO HAUNT ME.

493
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,366
IT WAS DEFINITELY DAWN AND

494
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,117
WHITNEY.

495
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,535
THING IS THAT IF DAWN GETS TO

496
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,661
THE END OF THIS GAME SHE'LL
WIN.

497
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:28,328
NO QUESTION.

498
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,247
THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO GET

499
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,541
HER OFF SOONER THAN LATER.

500
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,960
LUCKILY DAWN AND WHITNEY ARE IN

501
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,254
SUCH A BAD POSITION RIGHT NOW.

502
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:37,587
THEY KNOW THEY'RE THE NEXT TWO

503
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,715
TO GO.

504
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,549
UNFORTUNATELY WHEN JEFF

505
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,550
MENTIONED THERE WOULD BE A
TWIST

506
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,386
AT TONAL'S TRIBAL COUNCIL MY

507
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,013
FIRST THOUGHT, DOUBLE

508
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:46,722
ELIMINATION.

509
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,472
THERE'S ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY

510
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,724
THAT AFTER WE VOTE OUT ONE OF

511
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,558
THE TWO THERE WILL BE ANOTHER

512
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,685
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE IF ONE OF
THE

513
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:52,978
REMANNING TWO WINS THAT

514
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,272
CHALLENGE, I COULD BE IN
DANGER.

515
00:21:55,355 --> 00:22:02,404
SO I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS.

516
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,614
WE NEEDED TO WIN THAT.

517
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:09,453
SO MAD AT MYSELF.

518
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:12,039
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE ME.

519
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,082
I HAD TO WIN THE CHALLENGE

520
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,043
TODAY, THERE WASN'T ANY WAY

521
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:16,626
AROUND IT.

522
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,461
I'M MOST LIKELY GOING TO

523
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:21,298
REDEMPTION ISLAND TONIGHT.

524
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,925
THEY ARE SO ISSUE ABOUT THE --

525
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,302
COACH HAS THIS LOYAL FOLLOWING.

526
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,094
BUT IT'S NOT OVER.

527
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,596
I MEAN THE ONE THING ABOUT THIS

528
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,431
GAME IS YOU CAN LAY IN BED AND

529
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,767
THINK, I'M GOING HOME.

530
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:41,068
AND WHOLE DAY CHANGES.

531
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,986
THAT'S OUR ONLY HOPE.

532
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:43,570
RIGHT NOW WE'D BE UP FOR

533
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,406
MAKING A MOVE.

534
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,742
JUST PICKING THE RIGHT PEOPLE,

535
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,160
BRANDON IS SUCH A LOOSE CANNON

536
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,788
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO

537
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:53,497
BELIEVE.

538
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:53,914
RICK, HE'S NOT EVEN PLAYING

539
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,957
THE GAME.

540
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,126
EDNA, SHE'S SO FAR UP COACH'S

541
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,087
BUTT IT'S RIDICULOUS.

542
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,505
ALBERT AT LEAST SEEMS LIKE A

543
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:09,346
GOOD GUY.

544
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,681
WE'RE TWO VOTES THAT CAN

545
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:12,307
HELP SOMEONE.

546
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,975
I DON'T KNOW WHO IT IS.

547
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,602
WE HAVE NO ALLIANCE TO

548
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:16,645
ANYONE.

549
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,563
RIGHT NOW I'M AT A

550
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,314
CROSSROADS.

551
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:20,023
I FEEL LIKE MY ONLY REAL CHANCE

552
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:24,653
TO WIN THIS GAME IS TO SECURE

553
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,488
EVERY SAVAII VOTE.

554
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,782
I HAVE POSSIBLY GETTING EDNA

555
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:29,616
IMMEDIATELY FOR COUPLE OF

556
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:30,826
REASONS.

557
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,453
A, I REALLY WANT TO CREDIT

558
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,038
COCHRAN FOR WHAT HE'S DONE FOR

559
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,790
US BY MOVING HIM UP THE LADDER,

560
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:37,999
SO TO SPEAK.

561
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,835
ALSO WANT TO CURRY A LITTLE BIT

562
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,170
OF EXTRA FAVOR WITH A WHITNEY
OR

563
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:42,796
DAWN.

564
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,131
NOW I'VE BUTTERED THREE

565
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,382
POTENTIAL JURY MEMBERS AND LOST

566
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,175
AN EDNA WHO WASN'T GOING TO
VOTE

567
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,844
FOR ME ANYWAY.

568
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,681
LIKE EDNA HAS NOT DONE A

569
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,474
THING.

570
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,017
BASICALLY JUST BEEN FOLLOWING

571
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,686
COAT TAILS AND FOLLOWS HIM

572
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,688
AROUND.

573
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,523
LIKE TO ME THAT'S BOGUS,
BECAUSE

574
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,693
I HOPsLY TRULY LEGITIMATELY

575
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,904
FEEL THAT YOU GUYS DESERVE IT

576
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:08,655
MORE.

577
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,574
COCHRAN AND MYSELF PLUS YOU AND

578
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,200
DAWN AND ONE MORE PERSON THAT

579
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,328
WOULD BE FIVE.

580
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,746
AND VOTE EDNA.

581
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,541
THANK YOU.

582
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,210
I AM IN WITH THAT.

583
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:30,093
I'M ON BOARD.

584
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,262
A BIZARRE THING NOT TO TALK

585
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,555
TO THESE PEOPLE.

586
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,724
NOT TO BE RUDE BUT WHEN TIMES

587
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:36,558
COME TO VOTE SOMEONE OUT YOU

588
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,894
CAN'T SIT THERE MAKE YOURSELF

589
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:48,987
AVAILABLE.

590
00:24:49,070 --> 00:25:06,796
AVAILABLE.

591
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,800
I DIDN'T SEE THAT.

592
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:11,551
I'M SCREWED.

593
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,135
BIG TIME.

594
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,137
ALBERT JUST CONFIRMED MY

595
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:14,596
SUSPICION, IS THAT I'M GOING TO

596
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,347
BE VOTED OUT.

597
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:19,559
NOT EXACTLY SHOCKED BUT I FELT

598
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,061
COMPLETE BETRAYAL OF OUR TRUST

599
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:21,770
BECAUSE I SAVED THAT ENTIRE

600
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:22,479
TRIBE.

601
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,397
IF THEY THINK THAT EDNA IS A

602
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:24,981
MORE VALUABLE PLAYER FOR THEM

603
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:25,774
SOMEBODY WHO MADE MORE

604
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,276
SACRIFICES FOR THEM THEY'RE

605
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:37,786
SORELY MISTAKEN.

606
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,789
I CAME TO PLAY "SURVIVOR"

607
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:41,957
IT'S ABOUT BIG MOVES.

608
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,251
I DIDN'T MAKE THE BIG JUMP I
DID

609
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,752
TO BE VOTED OUT.

610
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:48,505
I WANTED TO MOVE FURTHER IN
THIS

611
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,214
GAME.

612
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,632
IF THAT MEANS SLIPPING BACK

613
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,092
AGAIN THEN SOMETHING I HAVE TO

614
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:52,634
CONSIDER.

615
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:53,593
HOW ARE WE DOING?

616
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,345
DOING GOOD.

617
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,805
I JUST WANT TO TELL WHAT YOU

618
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,807
THE DEAL S. WHITNEY AND DAWN
ARE

619
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,643
OBVIOUSLY DEAD PEOPLE WALKING.

620
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,312
BUT HERE'S THE THING.

621
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,940
WHO IS EDNA GOING TO HAVE THE

622
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:07,649
MOST ALLEGIANCE TO AS A JURY

623
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,610
MEMBER?

624
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:11,194
COACH.

625
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,821
WE'RE NEVER GETTING HER

626
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:13,363
VOTE.

627
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:13,989
IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS.

628
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,865
WHY DON'T WE TAKE THIS

629
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:19,327
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE GOOD OF
WHAT

630
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,870
SOME PEOPLE LIKE A DAWN AND

631
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:21,997
WHITNEY WHO COULD END UP BEING

632
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,623
VOTES FOR US AT THE END.

633
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:24,833
I'M GOING TO PUT THE CARDS ON

634
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,877
THE TABLE F. WE DON'T RID OF

635
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:28,545
EDNA NOW.

636
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,840
ALBERT IS SHOWING HIS TRUE

637
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,134
COLORS MORE AND MORE WHICH ARE

638
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,469
SAME THREE MY TRUE COLORS.

639
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,555
THIS IS OUR ONE SHOT TO MAKE
THE

640
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,348
BIG MOVES.

641
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,474
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWO, THREE

642
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,809
VOTES HANGING AROUND.

643
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,812
I'VE GIVEN NO PROMISES TO EDNA.

644
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:50,859
THEY ANNOY THE HELL OUT OF ME.

645
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,652
SHE WRINGS IT TO THE TABLE.

646
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,362
NOT OUT ORGANIZE, OUT CLEAN,
OUT

647
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:54,988
GATHER.

648
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:55,822
IT'S FRICKIN' SURVIVOR.

649
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:58,408
ALBERT IS TRYING TO TAKE

650
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:01,328
CONTROL OF THIS GAME AND I'M
THE

651
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,037
SWING VOTE.

652
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,372
SO NOW I'M DEBATING WHETHER TO

653
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,041
STICK WITH COACH OR GO WITH

654
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:06,708
ALBERT'S CRAZY PLAN.

655
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,585
IN THE END OF THE DAY IT'S A

656
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:09,878
QUESTION OF WHAT WILL TAKE ME
TO

657
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:19,721
THE END.

658
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:20,889
I THINK COACH IS GETTING

659
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:21,348
SUSPICIOUS.

660
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,891
THAT WORRIES ME.

661
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,643
ALBERT RIGHT NOW IS PLAYING

662
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,102
FOR ALBERT THAT'S A DANGEROUS

663
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,229
GAME TO PLAY.

664
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,731
SEE HIM TALKING TO WHITNEY,

665
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,232
DAWN, EITHER TRYING TO COME UP

666
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,068
WITH A PLAN OR TRYING TO CURRY

667
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:33,777
JURY VOTES.

668
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,904
NEITHER ONE IS ACCEPTABLE IN MY

669
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:36,613
OPINION.

670
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:40,909
IF ANYBODY WANTS TO GO OVER

671
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,786
FIVE IT'S INSTANT DEATH.

672
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:45,497
THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF

673
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,915
MOTIVATIONAL STYLE, THERE IS

674
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:47,832
CODDLING, REAFFIRMING AND FEAR.

675
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:51,127
SO I FEEL AT THE MOMENT LIKE AN

676
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:51,920
OLD MOB BOSS.

677
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,630
IF ANYBODY GOES AGAINST THE

678
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,758
FAMILY, THEY'RE DEAD.

679
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:13,775
Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

680
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:18,822
OUR MEMBERS OF THE JURY.

681
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:27,831
JIM AND KEITH.

682
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,792
SO DAWN, ONCE THE IMMUNITY

683
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,710
CHALLENGE WAS OVER YOU KNEW YOU

684
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,755
DIDN'T HAVE IMMUNITY YOUR JOB

685
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,590
BECAME, FIND A CRACK OR CREATE
A

686
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,299
CRACK IN THIS ALLIANCE OF
SEVEN.

687
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,009
TELL ME HOW THE AFTERNOON WENT?

688
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,469
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR THEM

689
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:42,804
TO USE THE TWO OF US.

690
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,140
IT'S HARD, PEOPLE THAT I SEE IN

691
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:45,849
FIVE, SIX AND SEVEN POSITION

692
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,768
SEEM CONTENT TO STAY WITH THE

693
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,979
GROUP AT FIVE, SIX AND SEVEN.

694
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:51,813
Jeff: YOUR PITCH IS, FIVE,

695
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,691
SIX AND SEVEN COME WITH WHITNEY

696
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,025
AND ME AND WE'VE GOT FIVE.

697
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:56,693
RIGHT.

698
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:57,152
Jeff: WE'VE WE'RE NOW THE

699
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,445
FINAL FIVE.

700
00:28:58,528 --> 00:28:59,028
RIGHT.

701
00:28:59,112 --> 00:28:59,821
Jeff: WHITNEY, WHO HAVE

702
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,866
YOU HEARD IS FIVE, SIX AND

703
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:03,575
SEVEN?

704
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,160
COCHRAN IS SEVEN THAT'S ALL

705
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:05,785
I KNOW.

706
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,370
Jeff: YOU FEEL CONFIDENT

707
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:07,704
ABOUT THAT?

708
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:08,288
I DO.

709
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,039
Jeff: BASED ON WHAT?

710
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:14,544
JUST OBSERVATION AND JUST

711
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:15,170
HEARING SOME THINGS.

712
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,296
Jeff: HOW DOES THAT MAKE

713
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,005
YOU FEEL?

714
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,006
NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS TOPIC

715
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:18,673
HAS COME UP.

716
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:20,925
I'M AWARE I'M IN POSITION

717
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:25,513
WHERE I'M A LATE COMER TO THE

718
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,181
UPOLU GROUP BE TEMPTING TO

719
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:26,681
AUTOMATICALLY MAKE ME SEVEN

720
00:29:26,764 --> 00:29:27,515
BECAUSE OF THAT.

721
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,642
I'M CONFIDENT THAT IF I DO
REACH

722
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,020
THAT POSITION I'LL BE ABLE TO
DO

723
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,813
SOME MANEUVERING.

724
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:34,522
Jeff: YOU'RE TELLING ME AS

725
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,524
AN AVID FAN OF THIS GAME YOU

726
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,360
HAVE NOT STARTED THINKING
BEYOND

727
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:39,861
SEVEN?

728
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:40,361
YOU'RE THERE.

729
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:41,112
THIS IS HAPPENING.

730
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,531
THERE ARE SEVEN AND THERE ARE

731
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,240
TWO.

732
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,034
TONIGHT I'M GUESSING IT'S DAWN

733
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,827
OR WHITNEY WHERE THERE'S A
CRACK

734
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,537
AND SOMEBODY IS ABOUT TO GET

735
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,288
BLINDSIDED.

736
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,498
IF NOT YOU'RE GOING TO BE VERY,

737
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,208
VERY LATE TO A PARTY THAT NOT

738
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,209
GOING TO BE INTERESTED IN

739
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,460
LETTING YOU IN THE DOOR.

740
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:56,336
I AM PLANNING AHEAD.

741
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,546
I'M SPEAKING IN THE FUTURE
TENSE

742
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,048
I'M ALREADY MAKING PLANS WHAT I

743
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,800
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE HAPPEN.

744
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:03,468
THERE ARE FRACTURES.

745
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,595
Jeff: LET ME PUT IT TO YOU

746
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:06,304
DIFFERENT.

747
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,055
TRUE OR FALSE, THIS IS GREAT

748
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,932
TIME FOR SOMEBODY TO MAKE A BIG

749
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:09,599
MOVE.

750
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,600
THIS IS THE IDEAL TIME TO

751
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:11,851
MAKE A BIG MOVE.

752
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:12,769
THERE FOR PEOPLE THAT THEY KNOW

753
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:13,895
THEY'RE IN A DESPERATE

754
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:14,646
SITUATION, THEY'RE PROBABLY

755
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,397
WILLING TO DEVOTE THEIR ENTIRE

756
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,899
LOYALTY TO WHOEVER IS WILLING
TO

757
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:18,900
BRING THEM A LITTLE BIT FURTHER

758
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:19,651
IN THE GAME.

759
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,402
BUT THIS IS TIME TO MAKE A BIG,

760
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,111
BIG MOVE.

761
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,030
AS A SURVIVOR MAN I LIKE BIG

762
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:24,614
MOVES.

763
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:25,114
Jeff: DAWN, WHAT IS YOUR

764
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,867
BEST MOVE?

765
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,702
MY BEST MOVE RIGHT NOW TO

766
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:30,036
SAY, I'VE GOT NOTHING BUT

767
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:30,703
LOYALTY.

768
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,122
I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN HARD

769
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,082
COMPETITOR IN THE GAME I FEEL

770
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,459
LIKE MY WORD HAS BEEN KEPT.

771
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,877
AND IN THE PEOPLE THAT I'VE

772
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,087
SPOKE TO TODAY, YOU KNOW THAT I

773
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,089
ABSOLUTELY WOULD STAND BEHIND

774
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:41,589
YOU.

775
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,216
Jeff: COACH, HOW

776
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,968
CONCERNING IS THIS TO YOU THAT

777
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:48,096
ONE PERSON CHANGES THEIR MIND

778
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,138
AND STARTS A SHIFT AND A BIG

779
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,391
MOVE HAPPENS AND SUDDENLY THIS

780
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,560
GAME WHICH IS IN SUCH CONTROL

781
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:54,143
RIGHT NOW STARTS TO SLIP AWAY.

782
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:57,730
YOU KNOW, IT'S ALWAYS A

783
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:58,439
CONCERN.

784
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,315
I'M ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT IT.

785
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,942
SOMETIMES I SIT AND I WATCH

786
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,986
PEOPLE GO OFF IN TO GROUPS, WE

787
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,654
HAVE THINKERS ON THIS TRIBE.

788
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,614
WHAT HAPPENS IF.

789
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,324
SO CAN THESE TWO GARNER TWO OR

790
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,576
THREE VOTES AND CHANGE THE

791
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:09,993
ENTIRE GAME.

792
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,202
ABSOLUTELY.

793
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,954
I DON'T DO A LOT OF TALKING

794
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,330
CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEVE I'M

795
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,123
NOT RUNNING THIS THIS ALLIANCE

796
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,584
OR RUNNING THE SHOW BUT I'M

797
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,459
ALWAYS THINKING IN THE BACK OF

798
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,670
MY HEAD THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO
MAKE

799
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,005
BIG MOVES IN ORDER TO GET

800
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,006
FURTHER IN THIS GAME.

801
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:26,134
SO I WORRY, I STRESS, I
BELIEVE,

802
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:29,304
I TRUST, ALL OF THOSE EMOTIONS

803
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,430
ALL DAY LONG.

804
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:31,139
IT DRIVES ME CRAZY.

805
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,474
Jeff: WHITNEY.

806
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,976
WHEN COACH SAID CONTRARY TO

807
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,312
POPULAR BEE LEAVE I'M NOT THE

808
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,646
LEADER OF THIS TRIBE YOU KIND
OF

809
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,647
SMILED AND ROLLED YOUR EYES.

810
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,649
DID I?

811
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,652
WELL, I JUST SEE A LOT OF --

812
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,154
JUST OBSERVING THINGS LIKE

813
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:49,032
EVERYBODY ALWAYS REPORTS BACK
TO

814
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:49,782
COACH.

815
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,160
SEEMS LIKE MAYBE THAT WOULD BE

816
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,329
THE POSITION HE'S IN THERE.

817
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,496
IF THEY'RE ALWAYS REPORTING
BACK

818
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,290
THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT TO ASSUME,

819
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:57,874
RIGHT?

820
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,000
Jeff: DOES THAT SURPRISE

821
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,002
THAT YOU SHE OBSERVED THAT

822
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:01,669
EVERYBODY GOES BACK TO COACH.

823
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,172
NO, DOESN'T SURPRISE ME AT

824
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:04,839
ALL.

825
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:05,715
IT'S BEEN WIDELY INTERPRETED

826
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:08,134
THAT COACH IS LEADER BY A LOT
OF

827
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:08,968
THE MEMBERS --

828
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,470
Jeff: IS HE YOUR LEADER?

829
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,971
I DON'T THINK HE IS MY

830
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:12,680
LEADER OR THIS LEADER OF THIS

831
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,349
GROUP OR ALLIANCE MIGHT JUST BE

832
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,017
A FIGUREHEAD WHO REPRESENTS
LEAD

833
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,644
ARE SHIP TO THE GROUP OR MIGHT

834
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:18,978
BE PULLING THE REAL STRINGS.

835
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,563
IT'S VERY EASY TO MAKE THAT

836
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,065
NATURAL CONNECTION FROM COACH
TO

837
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,816
LEADER.

838
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,318
Jeff: COACH --

839
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,403
I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M A

840
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,030
LEADER BUT OBVIOUSLY I LIKE TO

841
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:29,739
HEAR INFORMATION.

842
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:30,531
KNICKS IS THE BIGGEST POWER IN

843
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,532
THIS GAME.

844
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,742
WHEN PEOPLE GIVE ME INFORMATION

845
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,827
I TAKE IT, I FILE IT AWAY.

846
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,162
I USE IT ONE DAY WHEN I THINK

847
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,039

848
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,041
