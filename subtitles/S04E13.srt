1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:02,585
>> PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,755
<i>Survivor:</i> The tribe's spirits
were lifted when they got to see

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,882
their loved ones at the reward
challenge.

4
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:11,553
>> Way to go, girl!
>> PROBST: Kathy's son won, and

5
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:15,098
spent the night at Soliantu.
>> Coming out here, it's just

6
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,891
like, wow.
It's a whole other world.

7
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,269
>> PROBST: But focus soon turned
back to the game.

8
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:22,856
>> I'll tell you, Paschal is our
strongest adversary.

9
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:25,233
>> PROBST: Where old bonds were
as strong as ever.

10
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:28,820
>> It's now Rob's turn to get
chopped, but Paschal and Neleh,

11
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:32,282
that unit needs to be severed.
>> PROBST: Vecepia won the

12
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,284
immunity challenge.
>> Yeah, baby!

13
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,661
Oh, give it to me!
>> PROBST: And at Tribal

14
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:43,126
Council, Rob was voted out.
General, the tribe has spoken.

15
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:47,005
Five are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?

16
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:09,712
>> Oh!
>> Oh, yeah, now that's a fire.

17
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,714
>> Guys.
>> What?

18
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,218
>> He's hungry.
>> Oh, we're going to go get

19
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,555
some apples.
>> I want some real food, man.

20
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,891
>> I know.
>> This sucks, man, these days,

21
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,893
they're not going as fast as you
think.

22
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,272
At this point, people just want
to eat, get through another day,

23
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,233
count them down, win some
immunities and then see where

24
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,735
the cards lay.
The next few days, depending on

25
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,281
the immunities with five people,
I can give you ten different

26
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:39,742
combinations of what could
happen, and I'm not going to sit

27
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,537
here and do that because that
takes too much energy to

28
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,081
strategize.
At this point, like I told V,

29
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:48,209
just one day at a time.
I'm just tired of strategizing

30
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,920
and even thinking, but I'm going
to go out fighting.

31
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,215
>> The perception was always
that Kathy was being cool

32
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,927
because people were continuously
linking Sean and I, and then

33
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,764
linking Paschal and Neleh.
And so... and then obviously,

34
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:05,435
Kathy being the fifth person
saying, "Well, who's going to

35
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,646
get her to sway their way?"
But I truly do not believe race

36
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,608
is an issue on this beach.
With the subsequent swing vote,

37
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,235
they're going to look at these
two African Americans,

38
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,779
regardless of what we talk
about, they're going to say

39
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,324
"Okay, those two are in
together, you know, they may

40
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,619
vote the same, or whatever.
The two African-Americans, these

41
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,288
two are close and you're right
in the middle."

42
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,458
>> They made mention that I am
definitely a swing vote.

43
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,461
It's going to look big, playing
the race card of it.

44
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,631
I actually hadn't thought about
that until V said that.

45
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,759
>> Then, to be on that side,
with Pap and Neleh, and hearing

46
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:40,595
them saying, you know, "We're
not going to vote for one

47
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,764
another."
>> To come out here and be stuck

48
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,308
on an island with five people
who are talking and

49
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,018
backstabbing, that's really
tough.

50
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:50,271
V took Kathy aside and had her
little discussion with her, and

51
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,608
you know the whole race thing
just is... is just ridiculous.

52
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,152
It's never ever played a part in
this game.

53
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:58,988
Every once in a while they'll
just throw in something like,

54
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:03,368
"It's us two African Americans
against you two, and then Kathy

55
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,204
is a swing vote."
That made me really irritated.

56
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,373
It's almost like a guilt thing,
you know.

57
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,333
>> It's like you owe them
something.

58
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,627
>> I know.
>> That just gives me more

59
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,545
resolve.
I bet Kathy feels like an

60
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:19,342
absolute fool to even be asked
to consider something like that.

61
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:23,054
If V is coming to Kathy and
suggesting to Kathy that this is

62
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:27,141
a race thing, right here at the
end, I think V is really foolish

63
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,727
to believe that Kathy is going
to allow herself to be put in

64
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,314
that spot.
I mean, that's just sickening.

65
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,362
>> Just Sean's attitude
seriously is just like dragging

66
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,739
me down.
He just complains like all the

67
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,825
time.
>> There's absolutely no reason

68
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:46,661
from day one to believe either
one of them, never.

69
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:52,542
>> I would absolutely be puking
sick if you and V and Sean are

70
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,712
at the end.
I would just throw up.

71
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,881
>> I don't want to be cast like
the swing player that made the

72
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,342
wrong swing move.
Every minute I'm trying to

73
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,095
figure out this game and the
best way to play it.

74
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:07,390
I'm still looking out for
myself.

75
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:13,771
>> Oh, no!
We have to do stilts again.

76
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,524
>> Shoot.
>> "Balance, aim and cunning,

77
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:21,279
You've done it all before.
Capitalize on past mistakes,

78
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,614
come for a weight behind the
door."

79
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:27,744
>> Well, we got tree mail that
was written on a pair of stilts,

80
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,706
and it basically said that we
had done whatever we're going to

81
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,876
do before, whatever that means.
It might not have anything to do

82
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,085
with stilts.
>> Oh, yes, it does.

83
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,255
>> Well, if it does, I'm out.
I can never figure them out, so

84
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,758
I'll just wait and see.
When Jeff tells us, that's when

85
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:54,937
I'll know.
>> PROBST: All right, guys.

86
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,274
You've been out here 34 days,
covered a lot of ground,

87
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:01,694
experienced a lot of things,
hopefully with very few regrets.

88
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,614
But I know there's one or two
challenges you wouldn't mind

89
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,617
getting another shot at.
Today's reward challenge

90
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,745
combines elements of six
previous challenges.

91
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:11,996
You'll begin by assembling a
tiki.

92
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,083
You each will have a color-coded
tiki that's been chopped into

93
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,293
eight pieces.
The pieces have been spread out

94
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,587
into the jungle.
Find all eight pieces, bring it

95
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,131
back, assemble it correctly.
Move to the next stage.

96
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,842
You'll find a pile of coconuts
and a bamboo chute.

97
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:28,513
Break coconuts until your bamboo
chute is overflowing with

98
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,015
coconut juice.
Continue through the jungle.

99
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,143
You'll find stilts hanging in
the air tied to a log.

100
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,312
Undo the knots, releasing the
stilts.

101
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:40,149
Take the stilts with you to the
fourth stage: The stilt-walking

102
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,152
portion of the challenge.
It's a ten-foot section.

103
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,321
You must complete it before you
can move on.

104
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:48,199
Once you're done with the
stilts, you'll come to another

105
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,660
pile of coconuts.
Inside one of these coconuts is

106
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,662
a key.
Use that key to unlock the box,

107
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,456
you will find a slingshot.
That brings you to the final

108
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,376
stage of the competition.
Take your slingshot and your

109
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,254
colored rocks and break the tile
over your tiki.

110
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:05,216
First person to fracture their
own tile and get sand on their

111
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:09,011
own tiki wins reward.
I know how tiring 34 days is.

112
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:14,976
I hope you find the reward
worthy of a very long challenge.

113
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:22,191
Bring it down, guys.
It's a Saturn Vue, all-wheel

114
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,236
drive SUV.
Fully loaded, got all the

115
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,198
extras.
For you to enjoy when you return

116
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,492
home.
All right, guys.

117
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,911
Take your spots.
Let's go.

118
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,873
Here we go.
Survivors ready?!

119
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:46,924
Go!
V's getting it.

120
00:07:47,008 --> 00:08:06,068
Go!
V's getting it.

121
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,826
There you go, Neleh.
You're still in this.

122
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:19,207
V's almost there.
Sean and Neleh, tikis are taking

123
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:26,380
shape.
That's it, V.

124
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:36,432
You're moving on.
Neleh, you just about have it.

125
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:41,604
You're moving on.
Neleh, you just about have it.

126
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:49,320
Sean, you're getting closer,
too.

127
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:53,574
Neleh, you got it.
You can move on.

128
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,080
>> I don't have it, right?
>> PROBST: Not quite, Kathy.

129
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,915
Keep trying.
Sean, that's it.

130
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:08,923
You can move on.
Way to go Kathy.

131
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,466
You got it.
Move on.

132
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:17,348
>> Good going, Kathy.
>> PROBST: You're still in this,

133
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:22,812
Kathy.
V's got about half.

134
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,107
Neleh, you got about half.
Sean's got about two thirds.

135
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,152
Kathy working for her first.
This might do it for Sean.

136
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,446
Closer.
A little more.

137
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:37,159
That's it.
You're done.

138
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:05,855
Get the last knot.
Heads up, stilts coming down.

139
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:19,869
Nobody close.
Let's see if you can do what you

140
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,330
couldn't do a few weeks ago:
walk on stilts.

141
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:27,209
Cross this line and you're good.
Look at that!

142
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:32,465
You're good!
Find the key.

143
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,850
It's as good as yours.
Nobody close.

144
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:57,573
>> Yes!
God is so good!

145
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:59,283
I can do all things through
Christ, baby.

146
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,285
I can do all things through
Christ!

147
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:08,876
Jesus Christ!
>> PROBST: Nobody even close.

148
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,920
You know what?
You may not look good, but

149
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,922
you're going to look good in
that ride.

150
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:17,176
Nice work.
>> Give me some love, brother.

151
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:25,559
You got the reward!
>> Go, Sean!

152
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:31,148
>> It's beautiful.
It's automatic, too.

153
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,944
Wow.
>> Yeah, you look great!

154
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,613
>> Is that the temperature?
>> Temperature outside.

155
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:47,665
(honking horn)
>> Fantastic, Sean.

156
00:11:47,748 --> 00:12:02,972
(honking horn)
>> Fantastic, Sean.

157
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,016
That was so great.
>> Boy, your students are going

158
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,310
to be proud of you.
>> I can't believe it.

159
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,646
I just can't believe it.
The car is great.

160
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:14,442
It's a new car with no car
payments.

161
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,652
I'm blessed, man.
I can't ask for anything better.

162
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:19,155
I mean, the car is, you know,
it's beautiful.

163
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,158
First of all, it was winning and
overcoming the feeling of being

164
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,952
fatigued and tired.
>> I'm proud of you, brother.

165
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,497
Came up in here running things.
>> All those kids in the inner

166
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,625
city, for everybody who feels
like they can look at me and

167
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:36,505
feel represented, this was for
them.

168
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,511
It's funny when you play this
game, you don't realize that you

169
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,346
get emotionally attached to
folks.

170
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,515
Before you know it, you're like,
"damn."

171
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,393
>> I'll tell you something else
you don't realize when you set

172
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:54,648
off, and that's at my age...
how difficult it is for somebody

173
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,526
my age.
Physically, I'm a wreck.

174
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,030
I felt like I was quite capable
of dealing with anything that

175
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,492
was thrown my way, but the last
two or three days have been a

176
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,244
real struggle for all of us.
You know, we don't get any

177
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,621
protein.
We're not getting much

178
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,372
carbohydrates.
We're not getting much of

179
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,708
anything.
Our bodies have just been taking

180
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,045
a pounding and it's really
beginning to take an effect on

181
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,922
me.
I need to go up to the waterfall

182
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:21,717
and get some water.
I may wait and do it in the

183
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,552
morning.
I can barely get up.

184
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,847
When I get up, I have to stand
up next to a tree and close my

185
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:31,352
eyes because I'm so dizzy.
>> We're not really all in our

186
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:35,231
right frame of mind right now,
you know, we're like holding

187
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,108
on, literally.
After almost five or six weeks

188
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:41,737
of having diarrhea, having to
dig holes to take a crap, after

189
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,074
doing challenge after challenge
and dealing with mental games

190
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,576
and people lying to you and
sleeping in dirt.

191
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,871
You get to a point where you
don't know which way is up.

192
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,749
But I think Pappy-- he's more
lethargic and tired than

193
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,876
anybody.
>> Every time when I get up,

194
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,711
I get so, so dizzy.
>> Same here.

195
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,380
>> I sit up against a tree for a
second.

196
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,090
>> What's that from?
Is that dehydration?

197
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,841
Let's drink some water.
>> I don't know.

198
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,970
I've been drinking lots of water
and all day yesterday I was in a

199
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,972
complete fog.
I mean, I couldn't see things

200
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,014
clearly.
>> Same here.

201
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,267
Not only am I depleted
physically, but I'm depleted

202
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,894
mentally, and that's why Paschal
right now is cashing out.

203
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,814
He's just hibernating.
He's not going to do any major

204
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:21,694
twists and turns because it's
just too much.

205
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,574
>> We have to go out and get
troca.

206
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,910
Just in the next hour, the tide
is the lowest, it's the easiest

207
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,412
to get them.
>> I'll go with you.

208
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,789
>> I just need some help.
>> Everybody, if everybody goes

209
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:35,499
and just gets four or five,
we'll be okay.

210
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:39,712
It's much quicker.
>> Yeah.

211
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,972
>> Finding troca is more than
just troca.

212
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,808
It is beautiful to get away from
this beach and in that serene

213
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:54,685
South Pacific waters.
It's warm.

214
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:57,771
It's like a bathtub.
But I'm trying to bring people

215
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,316
out there to teach them; to go
out there are get that troca.

216
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,902
Because I don't want to be the
sole provider and work and work

217
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,154
and work.
It's tiring.

218
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,531
>> My first troca.
>> All right, man!

219
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:11,994
I'm telling you, it's like an
Easter egg hunt.

220
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,873
Sean's out here with his first
troca discovery.

221
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,626
It's taken a lot to get him out
here, I'm a little disappointed,

222
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,503
but he's a city kid.
So, I'm glad I finally got him

223
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,213
out here.
>> I caught my first troca

224
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,715
today.
You know, they hang onto the

225
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:25,966
rocks.
They like suction.

226
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,469
You just got to pull them off,
but the only thing is the rocks

227
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:31,555
are slippery as you're walking,
and you know, I'm not a ocean

228
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,975
guy and there's black-tipped
sharks out here and all kinds of

229
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,977
sea urchins.
So you got to be careful.

230
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:40,147
So, I got about five or ten.
You know, that's pretty good for

231
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:48,072
a brother from uptown, you know.
>> Today I just noticed that

232
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,033
Paschal was a little down
throughout the day, and he said

233
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,328
that he felt that people were
thinking that him and Neleh have

234
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,373
some type of agreement, you
know, outside of the five of us

235
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,417
making an agreement.
So I said I think it's best to

236
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,003
clear the air.
I don't want you looming with

237
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:07,049
some concerns that we're trying
to do something, coming together

238
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:11,595
that... to get you guys.
>> My attitude is: May the best

239
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,847
man win.
Out of this five, whoever wins

240
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,558
is very deserving.
I've got no problems with that.

241
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,727
>> Why don't we address that
tonight again?

242
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,523
I mean, I don't know if anyone
needs reassuring, but maybe some

243
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,525
people do.
>> That would be nice just to

244
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:27,361
say, you know, say how we feel.
>> Tonight, at some point, we'll

245
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,488
all sit down.
We'll allow Paschal to clear the

246
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,115
air.
It's best to try to get as much

247
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,410
of it out in the open as we can
than to sit here and have it

248
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,537
linger.
I'd hate for all of us go to bed

249
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:46,588
still feeling uncomfortable.
Let's just go ahead and open up

250
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:54,096
still feeling uncomfortable.
Let's just go ahead and open up

251
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,807
this conversation.
I know Pappy, I saw you earlier

252
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,810
today, and you had been looking
pretty down all day, and I

253
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,980
finally took the opportunity to
ask you, you know, what was

254
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,107
wrong.
And you addressed some concerns.

255
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,360
And since we're all here, you
can just go ahead and address

256
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,738
it.
>> Well, my concern was that I

257
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:15,909
felt like that you and Sean
thought that Neleh and I had

258
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:19,121
entered some type of pact to
vote solid on everything.

259
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,458
And I've said from day one that
I wouldn't vote against Neleh

260
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,461
and that's my word, if it costs
me in the end, so be it, but

261
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,421
that's my word.
>> I didn't know that.

262
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:30,424
I know you guy had a bond and a
friendship, but I honestly

263
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:33,010
didn't know you were not going
to vote each other out.

264
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,846
We're talking numbers, okay?
We're at five.

265
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,140
All right.
But you guys are really one.

266
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,309
>> I'm not trying to justify
anything.

267
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:44,188
I mean, if you all want to do
something based on the fact that

268
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,315
we're honest with you, go for
it.

269
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,318
>> And the thing is, too, is
that I feel that Sean and V have

270
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,154
a very, very tight bond.
And I think if it came down to

271
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,114
it, they're going to stick
together.

272
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,658
You know, they've been together
until the end.

273
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,453
They've got a really tight bond,
and maybe that's just something

274
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,705
that's like not coming out or
something, you know.

275
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:05,000
Like I have no idea.
>> I respect that.

276
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:09,046
>> I'm just saying...
>> Don't use me and V as a

277
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,340
scapegoat.
You came out of your mouth and

278
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,218
said, "I'm not voting for Pap.
Pappy is not voting for me."

279
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,220
Don't assume that V and I...
>> I'm just saying...

280
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,514
>> But you're assuming if
there's something underneath.

281
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,183
We're all being truthful.
I already told you V and I had

282
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,519
our differences and we still
have our differences.

283
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,313
So don't sit there and say, "I
think people are not saying

284
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,815
stuff" because that's an
insult.

285
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,691
>> I'm just saying...
>> I'm reading between the

286
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,984
lines.
>> Sean.

287
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,153
It's very clear that Sean and V
are very, very tight together,

288
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,030
whether they want to call it
alliance.

289
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,075
I think the only difference is
that Paschal and I have been

290
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:41,161
honest about saying, up front,
you know, we formed a great

291
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,330
relationship.
Sean and V are kind of skipping

292
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:46,166
around the table saying, "Yeah,
we have a strong relationship,

293
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,002
but it doesn't necessarily mean
that they won't vote each other

294
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,879
out."
>> From day one myself and V

295
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,382
never had a pact.
Although some people thought

296
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,051
"Okay, there's the black couple.
They're definitely..."

297
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:59,137
>> You know, we haven't walked
around saying, "We're the two

298
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,431
African Americans.
We're sticking together."

299
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,852
>> By no means is there a V
and Sean connection that's going

300
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:09,314
to download or whatever.
I felt like the conversation was

301
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:12,901
sidetracked when Neleh tried to
interject that there's something

302
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,238
going on with V and myself, and
I had to tell her just because V

303
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,116
and I are African Americans, we
share a bond that you won't

304
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:22,119
really be able to understand.
Does that mean we're an

305
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,620
automatic alliance?
No.

306
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,415
Because a few times V has
slipped the script on me and let

307
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,250
me down.
>> The most important thing out

308
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,085
of all this is honesty and
integrity.

309
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:33,422
>> I agree.
>> I think the bottom line is

310
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,883
there's a little alliance.
You know, there's a small one:

311
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:39,052
you guys made a pact.
I'm not saying it's wrong.

312
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:46,476
I'm just saying it throws askew
in how we progress.

313
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:58,447
That's all.
♪ ♪

314
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,791
>> It all depends on Kathy
because I know V and Sean will

315
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:15,464
vote for me-- 100% positive.
>> I'm not worried about it.

316
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,925
>> Oh, I'm not worried about it.
You know, last night was pretty

317
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,760
intense at the fire.
Everybody had a lot to say.

318
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,512
Things got pretty hyped, and I'm
definitely feeling vulnerable.

319
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:28,185
I just hope Kathy, you know,
doesn't fall for what Sean and V

320
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:31,188
are kind of playing out on the
table.

321
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:34,524
>> I'm totally confused.
>> You shouldn't be confused.

322
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:39,279
This thing is so plain to me,
it's sickening.

323
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,156
>> Well, then fill me in, will
you.

324
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,034
>> I will, as best I can.
I mean, this is my perspective.

325
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,828
I wouldn't ask you to change a
thing that's in your heart,

326
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:50,666
but this is just something that
just hit me like a ton of bricks

327
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,919
last night.
Geez, these guys are, have

328
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,673
planned from day one.
On the other side, I mean, both

329
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,968
sides have said the same thing,
and we've been duped by V and

330
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,679
Sean.
They've duped everybody else on

331
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,181
the other side and they've duped
people on this side.

332
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:07,683
>> Yeah.
>> Both Vecepia and Sean,

333
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:12,187
they've been just basically
skating for 33 days, and not

334
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,690
really contributing their part
until right here at the end.

335
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,401
We got that from the people they
were with at the other camp,

336
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,153
plus we were told the same thing
when we got back here about the

337
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,863
other members of the tribe that
was here.

338
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:25,617
Plus, the conversation that we
had last night around the fire

339
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:29,079
really got heated, and Sean, you
know, he got quite emotional,

340
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,373
quite loud, and that just turned
us all off.

341
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,625
It's not my desire to change
your opinion.

342
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,212
It's just my desire to say what
I think is going on and what's

343
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:40,215
been going on.
>> I just don't see that.

344
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:43,719
Damn.
>> Well, believe me.

345
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,721
It's cultural.
>> It's what?

346
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,056
I'm so naive.
>> It runs deep.

347
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,226
>> I know it does.
>> V and Sean, they're trying to

348
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:53,729
make Kathy feel like she's a
swing vote.

349
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,732
I mean, they've got an agenda,
and I don't give a damn about

350
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,359
their agenda.
I'm just kind of fed up about

351
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:03,030
hearing their crap about, you
know, them not being an

352
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,574
alliance.
And if you think for one second

353
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,909
if it came down to Sean, V, and
you...

354
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,580
>> I'm out of here.
>> Kathy, you know, she's from

355
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,249
Vermont.
I'm from Georgia.

356
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:18,128
And Sean's from Harlem.
This thing runs deeper than a

357
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:21,381
game.
I'm not willing to capitulate,

358
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,426
and, you know, I'm going to dig
in-- to heck with them.

359
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:28,055
If they're lying and deceiving
me, then first opportunity I get

360
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:33,101
to vote one of them off, they're
out of here.

361
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,113
>> Come on!
Come on. Come on!

362
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:49,284
Get it up there.
Come on! Come on. Come on!

363
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:56,666
Come on!
Get it up there!

364
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:02,172
Tensions are way too high.
Paschal thinks that Sean and V

365
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:07,094
are definitely up to something
from day one.

366
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:10,514
So I thought I'd fly my kite.
And it's too gusty.

367
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:18,647
It's not consistent wind.
I think if I go to the final

368
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,984
three with Paschal and Neleh, I
will invariably get voted out.

369
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:27,114
So I've been trying to figure
out how I can get to the final

370
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:30,867
two, and I think Sean or V is an
answer.

371
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,787
And when we do get to the three,
the three of us, we just... we

372
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,830
have to be fair.
>> Definitely.

373
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,291
Because I'm the odd one out,
man, I'm the white girl.

374
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,961
>> Don't say that.
>> I'm the white mama.

375
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:44,798
>> You know, V and I have had...
she's switched a few times on

376
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,049
me...
>> I know.

377
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:49,636
>> ...and people think that our
loyalty is brother and sister.

378
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,888
>> When she does, she moves
around a little.

379
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:54,182
>> Just remember that.
So, I'll play fair.

380
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,101
>> Yep.
>> I think what Kathy is feeling

381
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,520
is what we're saying.
She didn't really like the fact

382
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,981
that Pappy and Neleh had that
so-called alliance.

383
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:05,360
So maybe we're leaning towards
getting rid of Neleh and Pap.

384
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:11,199
>> I think both of them won't be
big adversaries.

385
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,577
I really don't.
It's a wide-open game, no doubt

386
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,538
about it, and I think the
immunity challenges are going to

387
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:20,167
really swing it.
Because they're not physical,

388
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:30,218
anybody can win.
>> PROBST: First things first,

389
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:37,434
anybody can win.
>> PROBST: First things first,

390
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,019
V.
I'll take back the immunity

391
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:44,691
necklace.
Immunity back up for grabs.

392
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:47,736
Have a seat.
All right.

393
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,198
Your success in tonight's
immunity challenge will be based

394
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:54,159
on your ability to answer a
series of questions from a story

395
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,411
I'm about to tell you.
Here's how it will work:

396
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:59,289
There are six stations,
spread out around the area.

397
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:02,709
Each station has a question
and two possible answers.

398
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:06,129
Only one person is allowed in a
station at a time.

399
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:09,090
So when you reach a station,
take your torch, put it in the

400
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,592
slot.
That means it is occupied

401
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,803
and nobody can join you.
If you answer correctly, you'll

402
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,139
reach in and you'll pull out a
tiki.

403
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,226
Attach that to a necklace around
your neck and move on.

404
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:22,604
If you answer incorrectly,
you'll get a bone, and you must

405
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:26,107
go to the firewalk and offer
your bone as a sacrifice before

406
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,944
you can continue.
So a wrong answer will cost you

407
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,904
valuable time running to the
walk.

408
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:34,449
First person to get five out of
six correctly and cross the

409
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:37,035
finish line with five tikis wins
immunity.

410
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,955
This is a very important and
beautiful place for the

411
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,958
Marquesan people, but as
beautiful as this place is,

412
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,126
it is steeped in a history of
violence.

413
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,589
This area, in particular, was
home to a legendary warrior,

414
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,759
Keikahanui.
He was the chief of his tribe,

415
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,428
and he was feared among all
other warriors.

416
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:58,682
His body was covered in
intricate Marquesan tattoos.

417
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:03,144
Now, the tattooing process
itself was very crude.

418
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,982
Tattoo comes were usually made
from human bone, sometimes

419
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:10,986
pearl, and even occasionally
animal bone.

420
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:15,949
The comb was pounded into the
flesh using a mallet made of

421
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:20,453
iron wood.
Very painful, took years.

422
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,832
Keikahanui was feared in battle
because he always seemed to know

423
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:27,210
what his enemy was going to do,
and he did this by infiltrating

424
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,630
the tribes of his rivals and
posing as an ordinary tribesman.

425
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:33,341
Well, he was living with a rival
tribe when he learned they

426
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,010
planned to make war on his own
tribe.

427
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,971
He didn't want to battle his own
people, so he decided to fake an

428
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:40,181
injury.
He went down to the sea and he

429
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,310
grabbed two sea urchins.
He took the guts and he wrapped

430
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,354
them around his foot with a
tapa, trying to fake an injury.

431
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,357
The smell was so bad the trick
worked.

432
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,277
The rest of the rival tribe
thought he was incapacitated.

433
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,322
They went off to do war.
As soon as they were out of

434
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:58,867
sight, he stripped off the two
urchins, disguised himself by

435
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,995
taking his long hair and pulling
it up into two buns and then he

436
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:05,332
grabbed his favorite weapon of
choice, the war club, made of

437
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:08,209
iron wood, designed to kill with
a blow to the head.

438
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,212
He knew a shortcut, took off
running.

439
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:15,884
His plan was to ambush the war
party, kill the chief, and then

440
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,386
the tribe would feast on the
chief.

441
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,557
This cannibalism was a very
common part of Marquesan life.

442
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,227
It was believed that if you ate
the meat of another warrior, you

443
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,230
inherited their power.
So the fleshiest part of the

444
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,567
meat was reserved for the
warrior who made the kill, and

445
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,278
Marquesan chiefs would preside
over this ceremony.

446
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:40,241
And a mana stone would be placed
at the top of the victim's skull

447
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:43,787
to capture their spirit.
Keikahanui's plan worked

448
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,914
perfectly.
Victory for Keikahanui.

449
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:49,459
He feasted on the dead chief and
then he let his hair down and

450
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,253
revealed his true identity to
the defeated tribe.

451
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,090
So with the power of the
vanquished chief now in

452
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,926
Keikahanui, legend has it, he
unified the tribes.

453
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:01,054
That ceremony took place on this
very spot.

454
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:05,266
I'll give you your necklace,
grab a torch, and let's do this.

455
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,061
This is for immunity and a
guaranteed spot in the final

456
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,105
four.
Survivors ready?!

457
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:20,156
Go!
>> The warrior who made the

458
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:30,458
Go!
>> The warrior who made the

459
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:37,632
kill.

wood.

00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:56,651
warrior..."
Crush the skull of the dead.

463
00:28:56,734 --> 00:29:01,531
>> "Keikahanui disguised himself
by..."

464
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:10,039
> Wrapping his feet with two sea
urchins.

465

>> PROBST: V and Sean have one

>> False.

00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:37,484
>> Warriors...
Wood.

468
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:40,361
Yes.
>> "Warriors most lethal weapon

in battle was..."
>> PROBST: If you miss it,

take your bone to the wok.
>> Oh, my gosh.

471
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,386
>> PROBST: Neleh and Kathy each
have four.

472
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,431
It's very close.
>> Okay, "disguised himself for

Disguised himself for battle by

476
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,608
gathering his hair into two
buns.

477
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:22,946
Okay, gathering his hair into

>> False.

You lost a tiki.

482
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:49,597
You must have lost one, too.
The game is still alive, guys!

483
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,599
Make sure you hang onto your
tikis.

00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,352
You got to go to a new question
if you can't find it.

485
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:59,315
You can't go to the same
question.

486
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:10,451
>> PROBST: Kathy has five tikis!
>> Woo!

487
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:15,957
All right!
It's so fun to win this game!

get any more valuable.

494
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,125
I got two people on either side
of me.

495
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,835
Paschal and Neleh are on one
side.

496
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:03,838
Paschal and Neleh and I have
been together from the get-go.

497
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:07,759
Paschal and Neleh have already
told themselves many moons ago

498
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,678
that they'll never vote against
each other, so that's a dilemma

499
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,640
for me.
But my other two people, Sean

500
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:18,519
and V, are also original tribe
members from the get-go.

501
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,189
They're telling me they don't
have a strong bond, and yet

502
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:24,150
they're both Afro-American and I
know that's very important in

503
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:27,528
their culture to stick together.
So I got Sean and V, and I got

504
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,323
Paschal and Neleh.
I got all these different issues

505
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:33,076
weighing back and forth, and I
have to make a decision

506
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:40,583
which way to go.

507
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,857
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in
the jury.

508
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:09,278
John, Zoe, Tammy, and the
General, who was voted out last

509
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:13,032
week.
Tonight one of you five will be

510
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,951
voted out.
You'll become part of the jury,

511

the jury who will ultimately
cast the final votes to decide

512
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:22,750

So Kathy, you got to be sitting

513
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:26,713
back there thinking, "Wow,"
because obviously right now,

514
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:31,134
four people vying for your vote.
You are clearly the swing vote.

515
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:35,805
You're the one that everybody is
directing their request to.

516
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:39,267
So where are you sitting right
now in terms of that?

517
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,145
>> I mean, the layers of it,
it's ridiculous.

518
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:45,940
The strategy of it is number
one, because I would be paired

519
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:48,484
up with Paschal and Neleh or
Sean and V.

520
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:53,448
And to just dissect how I'm
going to fall within those two

521
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:58,077
pairs is very difficult.
>> PROBST: So, the irony is that

522
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:02,749
tonight we have five people,
really only one of whom doesn't

523
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,460
need immunity-- you.
You're not in any danger and

524
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,128
you're wearing this very
valuable thing.

525
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:11,299
Have you thought about utilizing
the value of the immunity

526
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:14,927
necklace in another way?
>> I always think that this is

527
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,930
up for negotiating if somebody
wants to come to me.

528
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,975
I have to say, nobody has come
to me.

529
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:22,643
>> PROBST: Are you surprised by
that?

530
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,687
>> Very.
If it's a game and people are

531
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:28,149
playing and they want to win,
nobody has come to talk to me.

532

approach Kathy?

533
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,988
>> Me.

534
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:37,450
you're offering Kathy?
>> You give me immunity, I don't

00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,452
vote for you, and we go to the
top.

536
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:42,455
>> PROBST: You have two.
So why is that a good thing for

537
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,123
Kathy?
You're still outnumbered.

538
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,667
>> I don't want to put all my
strategy out there.

539
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:50,213
I mean, there's some things that
are obvious, but I'm telling

540
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:54,801
Kathy, you won't have my vote
against you, and you can read

541
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,220
between the lines all you want
with that.

542
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:00,848
It's tough, Jeff, because...
>> You haven't explained it to

543
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,683
me, though.
You haven't explained to me...

544
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,520
You haven't explained... come to
me prior to this, and so I don't

545
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:11,692
understand where your head's at.
>> My thinking was this: Because

546
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:16,531
these two had an alliance, I
thought that maybe Kat would

547
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,242
want to hook up with me-- this
is funny, us getting into this--

548
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,535
would want to hook up with me
and V.

549
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:24,872
The thing is me and V never had
that kind of agreement where you

550
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,501
had to feel apprehensive about
coming in and saying, "Here's

551
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:31,337
two African Americans.
Are they going to now band

552
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,549
together and oust me out?"
If they're going to have a pact,

553
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,885
then we need to have a pact
and then go and say, "May the

554
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,721
best man truly win."
Everybody is quiet.

555
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,683
So I can say what I know what I
can do.

556
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:47,603
>> Let me go ahead and just jump
in here real quick.

557
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:51,899
I understand what you're saying,
Sean, and if this was to happen,

558
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,194
if Kathy was to agree to give
him the immunity, I would fall

559
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:58,614
in line with that and work as a
threesome and have a threesome

560
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,075
agreement.
>> Let me just say one thing

561
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:03,244
here.
A lot has been said that by

562
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:07,081
Sean, who is quite capable of
explaining very well his

563
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:11,252
position, but in some fashion I
find it quite amusing and

564
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:15,256
contradictory.
Here he's said all night there's

565
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:20,636
no association between him and
V, and yet when Kathy pressed

566
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,099
about what his game plan was,
why he was willing to present

567
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:28,895
her to get her to the top, it
wasn't, "Well, let me talk to

568
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,479
V."
It was, "Well, you can get with

569
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,690
me and V, and then we'll have
the numbers."

570
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:35,818
That tells me a lot of what
Sean's been doing and thinking,

571
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:39,071
and I think he's disingenuous.
>> Jeff, I just wanted to,

572
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,281
because it was a remark made to
me.

573
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,743
I want to defend my character.
First of all, I don't think it

574
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:47,121
was disingenuous.
What I think is five minute ago,

575
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:49,957
I stick to my word.
V and I didn't have an

576
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,920
agreement, so what I put out
there was V could have been

577
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,964
Tammy or anybody.
What I put out there was a life

578
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,967
raft to say, "Yo, hang on," and
I put it out there.

579
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,552
Me and V didn't have no
agreement.

580
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,013
We've been the underdog, and
it's not like we've had an

581
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,806
agreement.
Like when you're playing cards

582
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,475
and Monopoly and you make a
last-ditch.

583
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,810
It's not disingenuous.
I've never broken my word.

584
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,813
I stick to that to this point.
I threw something out there.

585
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,815
Either she's going to say yes or
no.

586
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,110
If she says no, then by all
means, my card has folded, then

587
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,320
vote me out.
Let me go.

588
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,489
If she says yes, let's roll the
dice.

589
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:26,160
>> PROBST: So let me just recap.
So Sean and V are saying, "Give

590
00:37:26,243 --> 00:37:28,955
one of us immunity, side with
us; we'll go with you."

591
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,123
Paschal and Neleh are saying,
"Side with us.

592
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,376
We'll go with you."
So that's where it stands.

593
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:36,379
Anybody want to add anything?
>> Why didn't she know about

594
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:39,048
their pact a long time ago?
>> I<i> assumed</i> it was there.

595
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,841
>> I know you assumed, but you
know...

596
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,469
>> See, I thought she knew until
that night at the fire.

597
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,513
>> Nothing was confirmed.
>> Wait a second.

598
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,723
Wait a second.
We never hid it from anybody.

599
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,518
So don't talk about assumptions.
>> Yeah.

600
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:54,855
>> I'm not saying you hid it,
but being so close, why wouldn't

601
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,358
she know?
>> Yeah, but I don't care.

602
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,735
>> She knows now.
Well, point the finger at me.

603
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,529
The point is you didn't know two
weeks ago.

604
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,490
>> Well, I'll point it at you.
>> All right, point it at me.

605
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:07,451
>> The point is, she knows now.
She knew today.

606
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,829
She knows everything.
>> No, no, no.

607
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:13,874
>> If you'd just listen once in
a while instead of running your

608
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,210
mouth all the time.
>> I'm listening!

609
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:18,504
I'm listening!
What are you saying?

610
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:21,215
>> I'm saying that she knew
about it and we talked about the

611
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:22,717
negotiations.
>> Please, please.

612
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,385
She did not know.
She just told me.

613
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:27,221
>> Look, this is the deal.
>> They ain't going to shush me

614
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:28,723
up.
Vote me out, but I'm going to

615
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,224
speak my mind.
She did not know.

616
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:33,227
Now, they can play this hanky-
panky with everybody and do it

617
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:36,230
because I'm always speaking out.
Vote me out if that's your

618
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:38,441
conscience.
But you all deal with the BS.

619
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:41,068
She did not know.
You're putting words in my mouth

620
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,236
right now.
All right?

621
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:44,613
>> But you didn't know about
their pact though is all I'm

622
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,365
saying.
>> I didn't hear officially, but

623
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,410
it's a logical assumption
because they've known each other

624
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,078
for so long.
>> Come on, man.

625
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:54,290
I know I'm young and I might
talk a whole lot, but some of

626
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,584
the stuff I make sense.
Damn, I do listen.

627
00:38:56,667 --> 00:39:00,087
I still got respect for you.
But damn it, I'm a man, too, and

628
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:03,382
all I'm saying is none of this
jives up, because if these two

629
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,427
has a pact, that means they're
doing the same thing they're

630
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,555
accusing me and V of doing.
I'm disingenuous when I do it...

631
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:12,224
>> Just let it go.
>> Okay.

632
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,435
>> Let it go.
>> PROBST: All right.

633
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:18,939
So, here's where we're at.
Kathy, very powerful situation.

634
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,192
V and Sean obviously want your
vote.

635
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,652
Paschal and Neleh obviously want
your vote.

636
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:26,405
It's all going to come down to
what decision you make when you

637
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,491
walk from here to there.
It is time to vote.

638
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:38,584
Sean, you're first.
>> The girl-next-door act don't

639
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:45,925
Sean, you're first.
>> The girl-next-door act don't

640
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:48,636
work on me.
You're just here for the ride.

641
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,638
Y'all trying to win a million
just like me, and I hope

642
00:39:50,721 --> 00:40:01,524
you go out tonight.
>> Sean, this vote is for you.

643
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:05,736
Just too much drama.
I just can't stand it.

644
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:26,507
>> A great competitor.
>> My vote tonight is for Neleh.

645
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:32,388
>> A great competitor.
>> My vote tonight is for Neleh.

646
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:35,766
She's a great girl, but I think
she started a little late in

647
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:40,688
trying to play the game, and,
um, that's about it.

648
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,207
>> PROBST: Once the votes are
read, the decision is final.

649
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,376
The person will be asked to
leave the Tribal Council area

650
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:07,506
immediately.
I'll read the votes.

651
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:20,352
First vote: Neleh.
Sean.

652
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:26,901
Neleh.
Sean.

653
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:38,746
Two votes Neleh; two votes Sean.
Final vote.

654
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,414
Sean.
>> D'oh!

655
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:44,710
>> PROBST: You need to bring me
your torch.

656
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:59,308
Sean, the tribe has spoken.
It's time for you to go.

657
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,989
Well, I don't know if you
noticed tonight or not, but the

658
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:16,450
jury is all dressed the same,
wearing black.

659
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:18,494
I don't know if it means
anything or not.

660
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:21,956
I do know this: the only thing
that guarantees you a spot in

661
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:25,584
the final two is winning two
more immunities, and that begins

662
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,837
tomorrow.
You guys can head back to camp.

663
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:56,156
>> It's a lot one can say, but I
just know that through it all,

664
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,659
it's been a blast.
Y'all, forgive me for any

665
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,954
mistakes that I made.
I'm just a humble, young man

666
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:04,665
trying to find my way through
this world.

667
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:08,669
I just say keep your head up.
God bless America.

668
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:11,463
Peace.
