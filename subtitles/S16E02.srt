00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,377
>> JEFF: Previously on<i> Survivor,</i>

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,504
ten of<i> Survivor's</i> biggest fans

3
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:05,255
were pitted against ten

4
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:08,466
favorites from seasons past.

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,469
Both tribes immediately competed

6
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:12,971
for a shot at individual

7
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:15,432
immunity.

8
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,267
Yau-Man narrowly won the idol

9
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,810
for the favorites, and he helped

10
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:20,061
Kathy find the idol for the

11
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,855
fans.

12
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:25,775
>> Pick up that!

13
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:26,359
>> JEFF: The fans struggled on

14
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,236
their beach and failed to build

15
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:35,827
a solid shelter.

16
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,161
>> JEFF: Go!

17
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,496
At the first immunity challenge,

18
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,205
the favorites relied on

19
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,291
experience, but experience

20
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,167
wasn't enough.

21
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,794
The first immunity challenge is

22
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,423
won by the fans!

23
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:51,050
Facing tribal council, the

24
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,677
favorites were split into two

25
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,219
alliances.

26
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,346
>> Ami, Yau-Man, Jonathan and

27
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,098
myself, the four of us are a

28
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,516
tight alliance, but there's

29
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,059
another foursome out here--

30
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,144
Amanda and Ozzy and Parvati and

31
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,188
James.

32
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,731
>> JEFF: And both groups wanted

33
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,024
to recruit the same player.

34
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:06,483
>> We need a fifth.

35
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,317
>> I say Fairplay.

36
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,360
>> We need Fairplay to make a

37
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,946
strong alliance.

38
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,031
>> JEFF: But Fairplay made a

39
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:13,907
surprising revelation to his

40
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,742
tribe.

41
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,957
>> JEFF: Not everyone was

42
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:23,708
convinced he was telling the

43
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,251
truth.

44
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,336
>> If I know Jonny Fairplay, he

45
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,295
is going to pull something out

46
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,254
of his hat that none of us are

47
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,172
going to be expecting, and he is

48
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,423
going to stir things up.

49
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,510
>> JEFF: But in the end, the

50
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,219
entire tribe wrote down his

51
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,429
name, and severed ties with one

52
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,306
of the most infamous players to

53
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,224
play the game.

54
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,351
Jonny Fairplay, the tribe has

55
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,228
spoken.

56
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,479
19 are left.

57
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,940
Who will be voted out tonight?

58
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,454
>> I can't believe you just

59
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,372
caught that fish with your bare

60
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:02,539
hands.

61
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,164
>> I know.

62
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,374
How awesome is that?

63
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,918
>> Yes, guys, we lost Fairplay,

64
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,795
but we did gain a fish.

65
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,799
Maybe that's a good omen.

66
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:13,383
>> How awesome is it we came

67
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,677
back and now we're eating fish?

68
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,177
>> I know.

69
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,555
A late-night snack.

70
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,764
>> Well, we had tribal council

71
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,307
tonight, and Jonny Fairplay had

72
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,518
asked us to vote him off.

73
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,478
And I kept thinking something

74
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,855
was going to change, something

75
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:27,981
was gone going to happen,

76
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:28,773
something terrible-- that I was

77
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:29,566
going to be the one going home

78
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,525
first.

79
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,609
But we took him seriously and we

80
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,361
honored his request.

81
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,445
>> There was just too much going

82
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,197
on for him, which is weird,

83
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,574
because he seemed to be holding

84
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,075
it together.

85
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:42,161
I was not pleased when Jonny

86
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,663
pulled this, because it screwed

87
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,081
up my plans.

88
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:46,374
But you know what?

89
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,084
Everybody knows that if we can

90
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:48,710
continue to do what we're doing,

91
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,420
we should be able to win.

92
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,589
>> I'll tell you what, it is

93
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,756
delicious.

94
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,716
I mean, I figure that if

95
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,092
everyone had been out here for

96
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,011
30, 33, 39 days, something like

97
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:58,511
that, times nine, that's

98
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,847
basically a year's worth of

99
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,015
experience.

100
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,057
We're just feeling confident

101
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:03,975
that we can go in there and beat

102
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:04,809
these guys at almost any

103
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,186
challenge.

109
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:30,853
stuff we need to do.

110
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,897
>> We need water.

111
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:33,523
>> All this needs to be cleared

112
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,401
because it smells like...

113
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,949
>> It's day four, and we're in a

114
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,325
bad place right now.

115
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,910
We need to fix our shelter.

116
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,203
We haven't had any water.

117
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:48,329
Everyone is tired.

118
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,497
Everyone is hungry.

119
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,665
But at the challenge yesterday,

120
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,083
we beat the favorites, won

121
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:52,583
immunity, and along with

122
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,460
immunity, we also won flint, and

123
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,130
flint is fire.

124
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,423
So we're golden.

125
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,424
As soon as I light this, it's

126
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,218
going to ignite immediately.

127
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:04,387
>> Like, boom!

128
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,228
>> Woo!

129
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:13,062
>> Keep it going, keep it going.

130
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,105
>> Keep blowing.

131
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,399
Blow more.

132
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,596
>> How much of this do we have

133
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,764
left?

134
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,639
>> We've got to make fire!

135
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,141
I don't care how much we have!

136
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:50,767
>> At some point, we've got to

137
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,685
give up and say...

138
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,603
>> What are they doing now with

139
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:53,853
the fire?

140
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,480
Do we know?

141
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:56,856
Let's go find out.

142
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,441
>> The boys are still back there

143
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,484
trying to start a fire.

144
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,611
They're all chopping away, but

145
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,863
we've got nothing!

146
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:04,530
Number one priority for me is

147
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,908
shelter, because pretty much

148
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,409
every night it rains.

149
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,994
So let's go and let's do it.

150
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,496
What is the problem?

151
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,997
I don't understand.

152
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:13,623
>> Why is everybody talking all

153
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,292
the time and not working?

154
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,044
>> Oh, this will be the worst

155
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,003
night in the history of our

156
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:19,962
lives.

157
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:20,505
>> We've got no shelter.

158
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,757
Nothing.

159
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,175
>> Yeah.

160
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:24,801
>> Then let's all... can we all

161
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,552
get in on it and start humping

162
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,346
it?

163
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,722
>> No, they're not going to help

164
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:30,598
build a shelter.

165
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,140
They're going to go dig for

166
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,642
wood.

167
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,650
>> I just spent a half hour

168
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,651
trying to do fire!

169
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,612
All you do is run your mouth.

170
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,031
>> And we have not had to go to

171
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,950
tribal council yet, and there's

172
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:55,081
drama!

173
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:55,665
>> We can clean out that cave,

174
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,458
shush it out with some palm

175
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,626
fronds, lay some down, and we

176
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,670
can sleep clean and dry tonight.

177
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,131
See, they're already cleaning it

178
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,006
out.

179
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,424
Oh, those rat bastards.

180
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,384
>> Yeah.

181
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,260
>> This is exactly what we were

182
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,010
getting ready to do.

183
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:08,845
>> We were going to come and

184
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:09,720
clean it out and put some palm

185
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,513
fronds down, and that was going

186
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:10,972
to be home tonight.

187
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:11,514
>> No, this is my habitat

188
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:16,435
tonight.

189
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,564
>> Tracy, Kathy, and Chet, I

190
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,690
don't think they accomplished a

191
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,025
single productive thing all day

192
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,110
long.

193
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,069
And I just don't even want to be

194
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,404
around them, so I told them

195
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:26,988
straight up, I was like, "I

196
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:27,655
don't want you sleeping in the

197
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,782
cave."

198
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:30,783
>> I'm not going to fight with

199
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,368
these kids, you know?

200
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:33,661
I mean, they hate us.

201
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,581
Come on.

202
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,541
>> Tracy, Chet, and myself have

203
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,169
pretty much been shunned by the

204
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,420
other people.

205
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,462
And you can't fight seven

206
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,006
against three.

207
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,133
It just makes you relive things

208
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:47,717
in your life-- high school,

209
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,593
whatever-- when you didn't fit

210
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:49,677
in and you were kind of outcast.

211
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,679
It just kind of brings it all

212
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,931
back.

213
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,394
>> Yeah, let's do that.

214
00:07:58,477 --> 00:08:00,563
Let's grab it.

215
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,690
>> Oh, they took it.

216
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,816
>> They just took it.

217
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,526
>> Okay, okay.

218
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,779
>> Tell me we're not divided.

219
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,382
>> We were quite disorganized in

220
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,508
the last challenge, so we're

221
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,092
going to try to do a little

222
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,594
better today.

223
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,554
And we're hoping that the fans

224
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,473
have slept poorly and are still

225
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,476
way behind us on the camp curve,

226
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,060
because we're doing great, I

227
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,729
mean, honestly.

228
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,158
>> And we thought this one was

229
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,159
big.

230
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,285
>> Yeah.

231
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,411
>> Right?

232
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,371
>> Yeah.

233
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,957
I'm starting to become... I'm

234
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,333
starting to become really

235
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,626
attracted to Amanda.

236
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,086
She is so cute.

237
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,254
I mean, she's beautiful, and

238
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,506
it's like... oh, we've just got

239
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,634
to stay apart as long as

240
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,927
possible, because if it becomes

241
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:13,761
obvious to the group, then I'm

242
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,680
going to have a giant target on

243
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:16,806
my back.

244
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:17,640
I wonder if we'll get some

245
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:17,890
sharks.

246
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,517
>> I hope so.

247
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,310
>> Watch out.

248
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,285
>> That's the same color I

249
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,202
found.

250
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,578
I started off working out a

251
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,162
flirting angle with James, and

252
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,872
it was just so easy because he's

253
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,709
just so cute, you know?

254
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,044
>> What do you think, Amanda, is

255
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,296
it love?

256
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,964
>> I don't know.

257
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:50,715
I definitely think that James

258
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:51,841
and Parvati have something going

259
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,801
on.

260
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:54,927
And, you know, I've always

261
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:55,970
thought Ozzy was really, really

262
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,805
cute, and so it's kind of like a

263
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,390
couple-y alliance, yeah.

264
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:00,016
But we just have to be careful,

265
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:00,725
because I don't want it to screw

266
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,894
up my game.

267
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,071
>> I'm going to finally get some

268
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:14,697
sleep.

269
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,532
>> Well, this worked out

270
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:17,325
beautiful.

271
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,201
>> Imagine that.

272
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,579
>> And it's solid.

273
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,080
>> Kathy, Chet, and myself, we

274
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,457
made a new shelter for the three

275
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,833
of us, and we're going to make

276
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:26,709
it our home.

277
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,711
>> I like how they did that on

278
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:29,795
part of their wall.

279
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,671
>> Definitely.

280
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:31,797
That's a crazy covering.

281
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:32,798
That's awesome.

282
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,467
>> I think if we build it here

283
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,051
and you guys have already have

284
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,969
yours, and we have a fire in the

285
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,471
middle, then we can all just sit

286
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,348
down and just bury the hatchet.

287
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,474
>> Clean that out and use the

288
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,851
back of the tree.

289
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,144
>> No, I would like you to, yes,

290
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:45,770
please.

291
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,730
>> The other seven, they came

292
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,899
over and asked me to help them

293
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,485
build their new shelter, so I

294
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,986
think that I've earned a little

295
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,237
bit of respect from them.

296
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,405
But right now, all I care about

297
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,573
is getting a fire, because if I

298
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:58,908
don't get some water in me, I'm

299
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,326
going to die.

300
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,202
>> We are going to get it right

301
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,078
now.

302
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,788
>> We are.

303
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:11,921
>> Blow, blow.

304
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,924
Keep blowing.

305
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,725
>> Get some little sticks in

306
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,435
there.

307
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,895
>> There we go!

308
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,313
>> Yes!

309
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,024
>> We made fire!

310
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,943
Feels so good!

311
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,736
>> Finally, we got fire.

312
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,114
Now we can boil water.

313
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,032
We actually found some clams,

314
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,076
so we're going to get some food

315
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,077
in our bellies, and it's

316
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,203
definitely a really good

317
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,162
feeling.

318
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,288
>> Food, finally!

319
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,498
>> Oh, my god!

320
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,624
Oh!

321
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:49,959
>> That is so good!

322
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,001
>> Oh, boy!

323
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,211
>> The whole dynamic of the

324
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,004
tribe just completely turned

325
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,214
around.

326
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,298
>> Everybody seems to kind of

327
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,299
put their issues behind them,

328
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,968
and we're much more unified as a

329
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,219
tribe.

330
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,387
And what's that right in the

331
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,680
middle?

332
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,722
>> A ticket stub.

333
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:04,974
I go to a lot of ball games and

334
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,851
a lot of concerts.

335
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,727
>> Yeah.

336
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,938
>> Oh, my God, I love it.

337
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,315
>> I'm definitely flirting with

338
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:13,941
Mary, absolutely.

339
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,610
She's a cute girl and I'm having

340
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,154
fun with her on the island.

341
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:18,821
She's a friendly, funny girl to

342
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,157
get along with.

343
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,075
I want to get Mary to trust me,

344
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,035
and if I can use my flirtatious

345
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:25,828
ability to get her in my back

346
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,830
pocket, then I'm going to use

347
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,582
it.

348
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,333
Come here.

349
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,336
>> Oh, god.

350
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,713
>> Protein!

351
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:35,963
Protein!

352
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,048
>> Mikey, I think, really likes

353
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,593
how Mary looks, and has

354
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,677
maneuvered himself pretty close

355
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,845
to her.

356
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,013
That's right out of, you know,

357
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,098
Player School 101, I think.

358
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,683
So obviously, I'm going to keep

359
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,602
my eyes on them.

360
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,479
But my priority right now is to

361
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,855
keep my tribe strong, so I think

362
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,024
the three outsiders, Tracy,

363
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:55,941
Chet, and Kathy, they'll be out

364
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,945
of here as soon as possible.

365
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,774
>> I was awake quite a bit last

366
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,567
night, and I heard the sounds

367
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,028
of...

368
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:44,031
...jungle love, I guess.

369
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,242
I think we'll be receiving birth

370
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,701
announcements from Amanda on

371
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,161
her little Ozzlets she's about

372
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,623
to have.

373
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:53,249
And Parvati and James will be at

374
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,041
the wedding as soon as this is

375
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,043
over.

376
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,169
So yeah, it's a little more than

377
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,045
just alliances there with those

378
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:01,090
guys, so that's what makes it

379
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,842
scary.

380
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,312
>> It's silly, you know?

381
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,772
Go get a hotel room.

382
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:17,982
I mean, you've got to take one

383
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,608
step back and say, "There might

384
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,528
be somebody awake."

385
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,989
We are sleeping together in a

386
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,367
cave, you know.

387
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,703
>> Mm-hmm.

388
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,463
>> The two couples separate

389
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,840
don't really bother me, but the

390
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,384
four of them together poses a

391
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,928
problem.

392
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:48,929
I don't know just yet how I'm

393
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,098
going to dismantle that

394
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,435
foursome.

395
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,271
But I'm going to try.

396
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,114
>> Okay.

397
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,241
We have myself, Eliza, Ami, Yau-

398
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,159
Man-- there's a core four-- and

399
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,161
we needed one more for the lock,

400
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,079
and that was Cirie, who just

401
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,373
told me that she will work with

402
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,417
me down the line if we decide to

403
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,753
go that far together.

404
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,642
>> JEFF: Come on in, guys!

405
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,483
Fans getting your first look at

406
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,108
the new favorites tribe.

407
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,486
Jonny Fairplay voted out at the

408
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,488
first tribal council.

409
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,739
>> Good job, guys!

410
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:49,156
Good job.

411
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:52,201
>> Yeah.

412
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,160
>> JEFF: You guys ready to get

413
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,119
to today's challenge?

414
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:54,370
>> Yep.

415
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,288
>> JEFF: First things, first.

416
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,748
Mary, I will take it back.

417
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,541
>> I don't want to give it.

418
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,043
>> JEFF: Immunity is back up for

419
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,420
grabs.

420
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,880
For today's challenge, each

421
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:06,840
tribe will select five swimmers,

422
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,134
three puzzle makers, and one

423
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,177
keymaster.

424
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,054
On my go, the first person will

425
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,722
race out to a platform, climb to

426
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,100
the top, then smash a tile,

427
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,060
releasing a key, dive down,

428
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,896
retrieve the key, get back to

429
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:21,897
shore.

430
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,398
Collect all five keys.

431
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,274
Then the keymaster will open a

432
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,318
chest containing puzzle pieces.

433
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,111
The puzzle makers will then take

434
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,280
these pieces and assemble a

435
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,282
puzzle map of Micronesia.

436
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,243
The first tribe to finish wins.

437
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,202
Want to know what you're playing

438
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:35,369
for?

439
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,954
>> Yeah.

440
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:37,663
>> Yeah.

441
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:38,622
>> Mm-hmm.

442
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,623
>> JEFF: Winning tribe wins

443
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:40,624
immunity and is safe from tribal

444
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,625
council.

445
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:42,418
And you're playing for a

446
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,043
reward-- fishing gear...

447
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,839
>> All right!

448
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,549
>> JEFF: ...as well as a bamboo

449
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:49,717
fishing boat that will be

450
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,301
waiting for you back at camp.

451
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,011
>> Oh, nice!

452
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:53,470
>> JEFF: There's more.

453
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,180
The winning tribe will also

454
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,515
select one person from the

455
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,808
losing tribe to go to Exile

456
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:58,058
Island.

457
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,728
The bad news about Exile

458
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:01,937
Island-- you're separated from

459
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,229
your tribe.

460
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,732
The good news-- hidden somewhere

461
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,150
on Exile Island is a hidden

462
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,402
immunity idol.

463
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,653
Find that idol, you have power

464
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,697
in this game.

465
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,322
There is one other twist in this

466
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,199
challenge, which I will tell you

467
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,702
after this challenge is over.

468
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:17,953
>> Oh, god!

469
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:18,996
>> JEFF: It's a lot, plus

470
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:19,955
immunity.

471
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:20,748
Worth playing for?

472
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:21,623
>> Absolutely.

473
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,458
>> JEFF: Fans, you have one

474
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,208
extra member.

475
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:23,667
Sitting somebody out.

476
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,878
Who's it going to be?

477
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,841
>> Okay, I guess I am.

478
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:31,717
>> JEFF: Kathy will have a spot

479
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,509
on the bench.

480
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,510
I'll give you guys a minute to

481
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,179
strategize, we'll get started.

482
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,265
Here we go, for immunity and

483
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,809
reward.

484
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,060
Survivors ready?

485
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,395
Go!

486
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:46,982
Ozzy and Jason across the lily

487
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:47,149
pads.

488
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,986
Ozzy makes it, Jason doesn't.

489
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:52,321
>> Come on, Jason!

490
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,239
You got it, baby, nice.

491
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,574
>> JEFF: Ozzy making fast work

492
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,367

493
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,202
platform.

494
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:04,958
Ozzy not even hesitating.

495
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,001
Smashes the tile.

496
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,546
He's in the water with the key.

497
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,425
Jason obliterates his tile.

498
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,218
Ozzy has the key, and he's

499
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,136

500
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,930

00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,276
>> JEFF: Jonathan increasing the

574
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,739
lead for the favorites.

575
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:44,326
Jonathan can't find his key.

576
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:49,790
Mikey B. trying to make up some

577
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,124
time.

578
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,209
>> Jonathan, other way, other

579
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:52,459
way!

580
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,379
Right in front of you.

581
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,672
>> JEFF: Mikey B. back with that

582
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,839
third key.

583
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,715
>> Let's go, Erik!

584
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,969
Let's go, Erik.

585
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,470
>> JEFF: Erik out on the course.

586
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,390
Penner has the fifth and final

587
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,600
key for the favorites.

588
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,352
>> Yeah, Jonathan!

589
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,480
>> JEFF: Erik not giving up.

590
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,731
>> Let's go, Erik.

591
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:15,691
You got it!

592
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:16,650
>> JEFF: Erik knocks his tile.

593
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:17,567
Penner back with the fifth and

594
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,278
final key for the favorites!

595
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,362
James starting to work on the

596
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,322
chest.

597
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,824
Erik has his key.

598
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,201
Chet's is still in the water.

599
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:27,494
Five keys, five locks.

600
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,205
James has two locks undone.

601
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:32,708
One key left in the water for

602
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,001
the fans.

603
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:34,459
You're still in this.

604
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,295
Jason back out to retrieve

605
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,714
Chet's key.

606
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,465
James now has four locks open.

607
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,926
James has all five open.

608
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,928
Favorites start working on the

609
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:45,429
puzzle.

610
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:48,473
>> We've got to get the pieces

611
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,392
out.

612
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,727
So we can see them.

613
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,061
>> JEFF: Eliza, Cirie, Yau-Man,

614
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:53,687
trying to figure out the key to

615
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,647
this puzzle.

616
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,442
It is a map of Micronesia.

617
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,736
Jason heading back with the

618
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,571
fifth key for the fans.

619
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,613
>> This one goes here.

620
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,531
>> JEFF: Favorites think they're

621
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:05,657
getting close.

622
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:09,327
>> Oh, my gosh!

623
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,454
>> Here it goes.

624
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,580
>> That's it, that's it!

625
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:16,001
>> JEFF: Favorites win immunity!

626
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,502
And reward.

627
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,050
>> We did it!

628
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:23,592
>> Woo!

629
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,594
Yes!

630
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,804
Oh, my god!

631
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,097
>> JEFF: Favorites,

632
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,265
congratulations.

633
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:31,558
>> Thanks!

634
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:35,145
>> JEFF: Nobody going home from

635
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:38,690
the favorites.

636
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,733
In addition, all this fishing

637
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:40,859
gear and a bamboo fishing boat

638
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:41,485
waiting for you back at camp.

639
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,653
One more thing to deal with--

640
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:44,988
you must now choose somebody

641
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:45,614
from the tribe of fans to send

642
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,158
to Exile Island, and they will

643
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,285
return to camp in the morning in

644
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,412
time for tribal council.

645
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,705
>> Yeah.

646
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,165
Kathy, yeah, all right.

647
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:56,124
>> JEFF: Who's it going to be?

648
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,125
Who are you sending to exile?

649
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:57,959
>> The one...

650
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:58,835
>> Kathy.

651
00:22:58,919 --> 00:22:59,878
>> ...with the hat.

652
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:00,462
>> JEFF: Kathy, before I send

653
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,546
you on your way, we'll get to

654
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,757
the twist I told about.

655
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,425
Tribe of favorites, you must now

656
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,802
choose somebody from your own

657
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,970
tribe to join Kathy on Exile

658
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,639
Island.

659
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,600
Two people, one idol.

660
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:14,810
>> Wow.

661
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,061
>> JEFF: You will both spend the

662
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:16,603
night together on Exile.

663
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,147
You will both get the first clue

664
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,232
to the location of the hidden

665
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,275
immunity idol.

666
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,487
>> Cirie is going to go.

667
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,613
>> JEFF: All right, Kathy and

668
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,573
Cirie, grab your stuff.

669
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,991
The boat's waiting.

670
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,493
>> Bye, Kathy.

671
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,536
>> Bye.

672
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,620
>> Bye.

673
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:34,621
>> JEFF: Fans, nothing else for

674
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:35,622
you except a date with me

675
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:36,998
tomorrow night at tribal

676
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:37,582
council, where one of you will

677
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,460
be going home.

678
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:40,836
Grab your stuff.

679
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,922
Head back to camp.

680
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,615
>> Exile Island, that I never

681
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,783
got to go to.

682
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:12,951
>> That's right, you never got

683
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:13,952
to go.

684
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,120
>> Well, I'm here now.

685
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:15,745
>> I think staying here on Exile

686
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:16,621
Island with Cirie is actually a

687
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:17,706
good thing.

688
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,208
Watching her from her season,

689
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,459
she really grew a lot.

690
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,335
And she's so sweet.

691
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,295
She's so motherly.

692
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:23,712
She's right there.

693
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:24,629
>> Let's go.

694
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:25,505
We've got to move quick, because

695
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,424
we're not going to have a lot of

696
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:28,592
time before it gets dark.

697
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,397
>> You've got to climb.

698
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,231
The part about "go to the

699
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:43,982
start," they're not talking the

700
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:44,858
start of our own island, are

701
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,067
they?

702
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,194
>> It can't be-- aahh!

703
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,613
I'm thinking, let's go back.

704
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:53,825
Right now, my team is nine

705
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,452
people.

706
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,828
There's Parvati and those guys,

707
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:57,662
and Jonathan and those guys, and

708
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,748
then I'm smack dab in the

709
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:00,749
middle.

710
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:01,583
So all I was thinking is I'm

711
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,044
going to Exile Island, god,

712
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,795
please help me find the hidden

713
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,214
immunity idol.

714
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,506
What?

715
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,925
What?

716
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:10,675
>> Why another clue?

717
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:15,555
>> "Clue number two, continue

718
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:18,308
your quest by crossing the

719
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:21,061
ocean.

720
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,312
You've done it before, now

721
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,271
repeat the motion."

722
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,147
>> Right over there.

723
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:24,940
Damn, again?

724
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:25,899
>> Into the forest.

725
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:26,775
>> We just came from over here

726
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:27,317
and now we've got to go over

727
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,360
here.

728
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,152
>> And we have to do it quick,

729
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:29,986
because we're burning daylight,

730
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,820
girl.

731
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:31,655
We're going to go there.

732
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,823
>> Looking for the idol was

733
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,700
absolute torture.

734
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,789
The second clue, it tells you

735
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:41,623
that the third clue is across

736
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,542
another part of the ocean.

737
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:45,460
>> I got it!

738
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:46,294
Come here!

739
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,337
Hurry up!

740
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,546
It better not be another clue.

741
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,839
I swear to god...

742
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,852
>> I'm just seeing those two

743
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,396
things, looks like legs, those

744
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:04,688
two sticks.

745
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:05,689
>> Oh, right here?

746
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:06,648
>> I'm looking in the middle of

747
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:07,649
the ocean to see two things pop

748
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:12,028
up.

749
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,488
>> So then, we find the third

750
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:16,283
clue, back across the ocean.

751
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,581
>> Because it says, "You'll find

752
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:24,916
more to this lore."

753
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,549
>> I've never worked so hard,

754
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,843
walked so far in my life.

755
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,570
>> Get to the fourth clue, back

756
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:56,072
across the ocean.

757
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,907
Oh, my god!

758
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,367
By the time we found the fourth

759
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,036
clue, I was so tired and so

760
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,996
frustrated.

761
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,873
And we searched and searched and

762
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,417
searched and searched.

763
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,085
>> I know, it's almost like,

764
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,795
okay, you can come out now,

765
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:11,796
idol.

766
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,048
We give up.

767
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:13,923
>> We can't get this close and

768
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:14,883
then not find it.

769
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,302
>> I know.

770
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,939
>> We need to get some coconuts

771
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,524
and get the shelter ready, get

772
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,817
ready to get some water.

773
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:33,985
>> I think we need a round of

774
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,278
applause for everyone today.

775
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:35,904
Because no matter what, we come

776
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,114
together as a team, we win and

777
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,533
lose as a team.

778
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,910
>> I give it to all of you that

779
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:42,827
swam.

780
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,829
>> It was a lot tougher.

781
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,790
>> We lost our challenge today,

782
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,249
so this is our first time going

783
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,542
to tribal council.

784
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:50,794
I mean, that's a big deal, and

785
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,796
we're all very frustrated.

786
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:53,922
I don't care about losing the

787
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,006
immunity.

788
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,466
I care about the fishing stuff,

789
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:57,050
because that box is a box of

790
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,760
gold, you know?

791
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,637
There was everything there.

792
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,014
It's most likely going to be one

793
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,307
of the three older members of

794
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:04,933
the tribe going home, probably

795
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,018
Chet, because he did very, very

796
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,603
poorly in the challenge.

797
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,355
I mean, he was floundering

798
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,899
around.

799
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,109
If Chet's strength is what he

800
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,568
showed today, then come on.

801
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,778
There's no discussion as far as

802
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,613
I'm concerned.

803
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,073
All of us know who we want to go

804
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,658
home.

805
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:22,117
That would be Chet.

806
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,785
But there's all these variables

807
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,037
that come into play which makes

808
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,455
it difficult.

809
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,165
Okay, and then the girls vote

810
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,751
Tracy.

811
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,253
And then they're going to have

812
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:33,878
their three votes versus you,

813
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:34,879
okay?

814
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:35,797
So that's four to three, and

815
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,881
Chet goes home.

816
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,967
I'm suggesting splitting our

817
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,177
votes, four to Chet and three to

818
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,929
Tracy, just in case Kathy found

819
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,390
the hidden immunity on Exile

820
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:46,433
Island.

821
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,058
If she had it, they can give it

822
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,436
to Chet or Tracy, and then if we

823
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,312
vote them, it bounces back to

824
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,106
us, and we're screwed.

825
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:56,151
If Kathy gives the immunity idol

826
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,069
to Chet, us guys, us four, vote

827
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,739
for Tracy, and the girls, the

828
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:02,907
three, vote for Kathy.

829
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:03,950
>> Wait, wait, wait.

830
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,910
That's in the case of what?

831
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:06,995
>> If she gives it to Chet.

832
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,079
>> Yeah.

833
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,289
>> Now, the only way we can get

834
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:12,917
screwed is if Kathy gave Tracy

835
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,044
the immunity, and then it goes

836
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,798
to a tiebreaker.

837
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:19,924
>> We have to stick to it.

838
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:20,842
That's what I'm saying.

839
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:21,968
Let's get the final plan right

840
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:22,844
now and we don't have to talk

841
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,095
about it again.

842
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:24,971
>> Mike is throwing out all of

843
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,432
his different scenarios on what

844
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,058
if Kathy found the immunity idol

845
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,685
on Exile Island?

846
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:31,895
She already has an immunity idol

847
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:32,979
from a previous challenge, on

848
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,565
and on and on and on, so much so

849
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:36,941
that it confuses me.

850
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:41,988
My initial thought was, "Chet,

851
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,865
you're out of here.

852
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:44,824
You're done."

853
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,951
But Mikey thinks he's got it all

854
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,286
figured out, and I don't like

855
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,662
that.

856
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,414
He's teamed up with Mary, and

857
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,666
now he thinks he has pretty much

858
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,168
the entire tribe voting the way

859
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,003
he wants us to vote, and doing

860
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,589
whatever he wants.

861
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:00,882
But if I have anything to say

862
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,926
about that at tribal council

863
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,135
tomorrow night, it will be

864
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,261
abundantly clear that that's not

865
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,472
the case.

866
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,082
>> Yesterday we lost the

867
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,167
immunity challenge, so tonight

868
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,502
we're all going to tribal

869
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,670
council.

870
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:39,921
And Mikey seems to think that

871
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,548
he's running the show over here.

872
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,674
And I just want to put a stop to

873
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,175
it.

874
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,349
Mikey and Mary are very close,

875
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,850
and I believe that if we have

876
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,060
one person who believes that

877
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,311
they are leading this tribe in a

878
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,688
certain direction, their

879
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,773
strongest alliance, in my mind,

880
00:30:58,856 --> 00:31:01,109
would be the alliance to break.

881
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,194
If you take away Mary, that's

882
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,029
his closest ally.

883
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:09,033
>> Joel suggested we, along with

884
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,702
Alexis, work together to get rid

885
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,203
of Mary.

886
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,037
And it could be a good idea.

887
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,540
Because Mikey is a really smart

888
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,917
guy, and he knows what he's

889
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,669
doing here.

890
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:20,795
That's pretty diabolical, but I

891
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:21,713
mean, come on.

892
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:22,839
>> It's what the game is, bro.

893
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,048
>> Yeah.

894
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,566
>> Yeah, that's Kathy.

895
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,155
>> Yeah.

896
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,114
>> Want to try to get rid of

897
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:48,698
Mary and break up the Mike and

898
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,950
Mary?

899
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,662
>> Oh, my god, it's just a

900
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,872
little tiny piece of beach, and

901
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:56,873
that's it.

902
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,124
>> How was it out there?

903
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,917
>> Cirie is one of the nicest

904
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:00,877
people I ever met in my entire

905
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,086
life.

906
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:05,715
No, I curled up in a fetal

907
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:08,009
position.

908
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,305
So what's going on around here

909
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,306
with you guys as far as tribal

910
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,391
council?

911
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,236
>> That's all I'm telling you.

912
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,196
Just do it.

913
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,656
Just write it down.

914
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,282
>> I was super worried that they

915
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,659
were all going to pick Chet, and

916
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:33,701
when I come back from Exile

917
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,411
Island, boy, right away, Joel

918
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,205
steps up to me and goes, "It's

919
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,665
Mary."

920
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:39,707
I'm like, "Where did Mary come

921
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,084
from?"

922
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,210
>> Don't spill the beans before

923
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,378
we vote.

924
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,587
>> You have to tell me what I

925
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:45,797
can say and what I can't say.

926
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,923
>> It's like I tell my pageant

927
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,049
girls-- answer the question and

928
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,218
shut up.

929
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,177
Don't ramble.

930
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,303
Get off the stage.

931
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,137
>> Over the last two days, it

932
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,014
was Kathy, Chet, and myself

933
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,100
against the other seven.

934
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,726
And now we finally see a window

935
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,728
of opportunity, but I just don't

936
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,230
know if I can trust Joel.

937
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,189
Joel wants this million dollars,

938
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,400
I think, probably more than

939
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,276
anybody here.

940
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,403
And I feel that he's going to

941
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,529
stop at nothing to get it.

942
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:10,947
>> We've got a plan.

943
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,031
Don't talk to anybody else about

944
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,783
it.

945
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:16,285
>> Joel's pulled Natalie aside,

946
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,995
talked to her a little bit, so

947
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:18,538
we don't know really what

948
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:19,163
they're talking about, but we

949
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,416
just need to be really honest

950
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,710
with ourselves, and where the

951
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:24,752
weaknesses lie.

952
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,837
>> All of us guys vote Chet, and

953
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,421
if she gives the immunity to

954
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,214
Chet, we all vote Tracy.

955
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,133
Girls all voting Tracy.

956
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,635
>> There might be a little

957
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,011
confusion as far as our vote

958
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,013
tonight, but I really feel at

959
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,974
this point I can trust Alexis, I

960
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,726
can trust Mike, I can trust

961
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,394
Natalie.

962
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:42,687
So I don't feel like I'm going

963
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,813
to be voted off anytime soon.

964
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:44,731
>> I think it will be

965
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,649
interesting checking out tribal

966
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,859
council tonight, you know, just

967
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:48,776
like going there...

968
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,694
>> That will be fun.

969
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:50,820
>> If it goes as I think it

970
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:53,322
will, tonight, Mary's going

971
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:54,574
home.

972
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:55,783
Mikey will be completely

973
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,034
confused as to what happened.

974
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,453
And it will be me running the

975
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,747
show over here.

976
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,998
But I've been doing a lot of

977
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:02,373
running around.

978
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,250
I've been talking to a lot of

979
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,918
people, and if these people are

980
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,211
smart, I could see them

981
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,964
thinking, "He's too powerful,

982
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:11,758
he's too manipulative," and

983
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,092
being very leery of me.

984
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:16,179
But either way, I think on my

985
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:19,056
feet, so we'll see what happens.

986
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,623
>> JEFF: Behind each of you is a

987
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,082
torch.

988
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,042
Go ahead and grab a torch,

989
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:46,834
approach the flame, dip it in

990
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,961
and get fire.

991
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:53,508
This is part of the ritual of

992
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,175
tribal council because in this

993
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:58,805
game, fire represents your life.

994
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,473
As long as you have fire, you're

995
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:01,474
still in the game.

996
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:02,934
When your fire is gone, so are

997
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:05,311
you.

998
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,646
So let's start at the beginning.

999
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,981
Kathy, right off the bat, one

1000
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,191
person from each tribe got an

1001
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,234
immunity idol.

1002
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,860
How did you end up with it for

1003
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,237
your tribe?

1004
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,489
>> I came in last, and Yau-Man

1005
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:17,615
pointed out that my idol was

1006
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,825
under the boat, so I picked it

1007
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:19,784
up.

1008
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:20,701
I picked it up and went, "Is

1009
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,994
this it?"

1010
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,496
>> JEFF: The idol you have is

1011
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:24,288
only good tonight, which means

1012
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,666
you can use it for yourself and

1013
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:27,375
stay protected, or you can give

1014
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,794
it to somebody before we vote.

1015
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,254
So you're clear on how that

1016
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,296
plays tonight.

1017
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,422
>> Yes.

1018
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,423
>> JEFF: Let's talk about the

1019
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:35,633
challenge.

1020
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:36,968
Chet, this challenge for you was

1021
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,427
extremely difficult.

1022
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,638
You were exhausted before you

1023
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,849
got halfway out to the platform.

1024
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:43,808
>> Actually, I really wasn't

1025
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:44,725
exhausted.

1026
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:45,810
I thought it was best to come

1027
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:46,936
back in and let somebody else go

1028
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:47,770
back out, because I felt I was

1029
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:48,896
wasting too much time out there.

1030
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,522
>> JEFF: With all due respect,

1031
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,566
that's giving yourself a little

1032
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,817
more credit than I would.

1033
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,485
It took you forever to go back

1034
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,444
to the beach.

1035
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,362
>> Okay.

1036
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,238
>> JEFF: What's going through

1037
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,406
your head as you feel the

1038
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,532
pressure of nine other people

1039
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:00,700
going...

1040
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:01,993
>> Obviously it was a lot of

1041
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:02,910
pressure, but it was what it

1042
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:03,786
was.

1043
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,912
And I would have it liked to

1044
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:05,913
have been better, but it wasn't.

1045
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,499
It didn't turn out that way.

1046
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,084
>> JEFF: Mikey B.

1047
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:10,710
>> I think the most frustrating

1048
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:14,213
thing about Chet struggling was,

1049
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,506
if you're not that good of a

1050
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,549
swimmer, why are you not making

1051
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:17,675
a team move and step down?

1052
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,468
I mean, I was really irked by

1053
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,344
it, to be honest with you.

1054
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,806
>> JEFF: Tracy, tell me about

1055
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,142
camp life.

1056
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:26,601
>> It's aggravating.

1057
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,519
We have a lot of conflicts.

1058
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,687
The older people kind of went

1059
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,813
one way, and the younger group

1060
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:31,856
kind of went the other.

1061
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:32,940
And you just sort of get a

1062
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,150
little, you know, chafed by it,

1063
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:34,775
and you say, "I'm either going

1064
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,319
to sit back and whine about it,

1065
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,403
or I'm going to get up, and take

1066
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:38,613
care of myself."

1067
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,947
>> JEFF: Natalie, do you see

1068
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,574
people grouping together because

1069
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,451
they just get along better?

1070
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,579
>> Absolutely.

1071
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,205
I feel that some people have

1072
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,540
been segregated, and now we have

1073
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,666
two shelters, so clearly there

1074
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,751
are people that get along and

1075
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,127
people that don't get along.

1076
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,295
>> JEFF: Alexis, two shelters?

1077
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,463
This doesn't sound good.

1078
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,715
>> There was a certain division,

1079
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,926
and two shelters have been

1080
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,135
built, one shelter housing

1081
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:01,636
Tracy, Chet, and Kathy.

1082
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,679
So yeah, I mean, there's

1083
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,473
definitely some conflict there.

1084
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,349
>> JEFF: Chet, you've got to be

1085
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,559
a little concerned tonight.

1086
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,019
There are seven people in one

1087
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,604
shelter, and you three are

1088
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:12,855
sitting over there by yourself.

1089
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:13,481
>> Sure, it looks bad that it's

1090
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,441
three against seven.

1091
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,734
It's really out of my control at

1092
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,027
this point.

1093
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:18,611
People have to vote how they

1094
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:19,487
have to vote.

1095
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,322
>> JEFF: Erik, would you be

1096
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,573
concerned if you were Chet?

1097
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,491
>> I would be very, very

1098
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,533
concerned.

1099
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,576
I mean, he's outside of the

1100
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,661
numbers.

1101
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:27,787
He's not as physically fit.

1102
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,871
I would be very, very, very

1103
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,748
scared.

1104
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,124
>> JEFF: Mary, let's talk about

1105
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,542
alliances, or friendships that

1106
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,293
might be alliances.

1107
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,378
>> Sure, you can see people

1108
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,296
going their different

1109
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,798
directions, and alliances

1110
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,257
forming, but I feel pretty

1111
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:40,758
secure right now with my

1112
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,593
position in the tribe and with

1113
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,261
the people that I choose to

1114
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,638
communicate with and be friends

1115
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:46,472
with.

1116
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,516
>> JEFF: Joel, what do you base

1117
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,809
a vote on this early in the

1118
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:50,851
game?

1119
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,604
You barely know these people.

1120
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,438
>> I have a conscience, I swear,

1121
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,607
but I don't care if anybody goes

1122
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,775
home.

1123
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,193
I mean, I barely know these

1124
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,319
people, and I don't put it past

1125
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,321
a single one of them to vote me

1126
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,781
off tonight.

1127
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,157
It's a game of loyalty and it's

1128
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,660
a game of deception, and anybody

1129
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:08,494
can go at any time.

1130
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:11,288
And you'll never know who it is.

1131
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,540
>> JEFF: All right, on that

1132
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,709
note, let's get to the vote.

1133
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,502
Kathy, you have your immunity

1134
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:17,545
idol.

1135
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,380
It has to play tonight.

1136
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,258
>> I'll keep it for myself.

1137
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:22,758
>> JEFF: Kathy's immune.

1138
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:23,426
You cannot vote for Kathy.

1139
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,385
Everybody else is fair game.

1140
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,595
It is time to vote.

1141
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,431
Erik, you're up.

1142
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,206
>> Chet, you blew it with your

1143
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,125
body, your brains, and your

1144
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,293
heart.

1145
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,252
That's just not acceptable to be

1146
00:38:58,335 --> 00:38:59,670
a teammate of mine.

1147
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:27,865
>> I just went with the

1148
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:28,741
majority.

1149
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:31,243
I'm sorry.

1150
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,586
>> JEFF: I'll go tally the

1151
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,671
votes.

1152
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:53,682
Once the votes are read, the

1153
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:54,600
decision is final.

1154
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:55,601
The person voted out will be

1155
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:56,936
asked to leave the tribal

1156
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:57,937
council area immediately.

1157
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:58,896
If anybody has the hidden

1158
00:39:58,979 --> 00:39:59,980
immunity idol, now would be the

1159
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:03,234
time to play it.

1160
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,116
I'll read the votes.

1161
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:13,494
First vote, Chet.

1162
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,291
Chet.

1163
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,961
Two votes Chet.

1164
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,589

00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,883
Two votes Chet, one vote Tracy.

1166
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:31,887
Mary.

1167
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:32,972
Two votes Chet, one vote Tracy,

1168
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:35,224

Two votes Mary.

1171
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,944
Tracy.

1172
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:47,611
We're tied-- two votes Tracy,

1173
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:50,698
two votes Chet, two votes Mary.

1174
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:53,951
Mary.

1175
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:55,035
That's three votes Mary, two

1176
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,662
votes Chet, two votes Tracy.

1177
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,709
Mary.

1178
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,211
That's four votes Mary.

1179
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:08,632
Second person voted out of

Favorites,<i> Mary.</i>

1182
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:13,053
Based on the way the votes were

1183
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,139
distributed, five is enough.

1184
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:17,600
You need to bring me your torch.

1185
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:28,485
Mary, the tribe has spoken.

1186
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:32,489
Time for you to go.

1187
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,366
>> Bye, guys.

1188
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,618
Win this.

1189
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:46,086
>> JEFF: Well, based on what I

1190
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:46,754
heard tonight, Mary never saw

1191
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,839
that coming.

1192
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:49,882
Congratulations.

1193
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:50,758
First tribal council, first

1194
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,259
blindside.

1195
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,052
Grab your torches, head back to

1196
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:53,802
camp.

1197
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:54,428
Kathy, you can leave that idol

1198
00:41:54,511 --> 00:41:55,679
behind.

>> JEFF: Next time on<i> Survivor,</i>

1208
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,784
Cirie takes control of her

1209
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,702
tribe.

1210
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:23,499
>> Which side is better for me?

1211
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:24,333
>> Oh, my god!

1212

>> JEFF: The fans continue to

1213
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,085
suffer.

1214
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,336
>> Oh, mother of god.

1215
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:28,629
>> JEFF: And it's war between

1216
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,881
the favorites and fans.

1217
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:31,924
>> If someone comes and invades

1218
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:34,385
my home, I'm going to kill them.

1219
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,016
>> I have no idea what happened.

1220
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,185
I'm just totally blindsided.

1221
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,520
Not even a clue that I was going

1222
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:45,062
to be going home tonight.

1223
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,605
So it kind of sucks being the

1224
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:47,731
first person to go off your

1225
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:48,774
tribe, but maybe they you saw me

1226
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:49,858
getting too close to some

1227
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,151
individuals and making friends

1228
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,361
with others.

1229
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:53,737
I'm definitely rooting for the

1230
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:54,697
fans.

1231
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,739
They're all very strong

1232
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:56,824
individuals, and one of the fans

1233
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:57,700
will definitely win this
