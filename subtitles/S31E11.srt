1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,127
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,338
"SURVIVOR": SECOND CHANCES ARE

3
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:06,464
NEVER EASY.

4
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,133
>> I GOT SO MUCH RIDING ON ME.

5
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:10,093
MY WIFE IS PREGNANT.

6
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,052
I WANT TO BE THERE TO SEE IT

7
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:11,261
GROW.

8
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:12,220
>> Jeff: SOME WERE STRUGGLING

9
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:13,638
WITH THEIR EMOTIONS.

10
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,640
>> WHEN MY GIRLFRIEND STARTING

11
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,267
SAYING LIKE, "I LOVE YOU," I

12
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,226
DIDN'T SAY IT BACK.

13
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,311
I'M TRYING TO HAVE FEELINGS.

14
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,563
>> Jeff: WHILE OTHERS WERE

15
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:22,272
FIGHTING TO STAY ALIVE.

16
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:25,859
>> IF I DON'T WIN IMMUNITY, I'M

17
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:26,067
GONE.

18
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:26,693
>> Jeff: AT THE IT LAST

19
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:27,318
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, JOE LOST FOR

20
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,153
THE FIRST TIME.

21
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,238
>> Jeff: SPENCER WINS

22
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:30,655
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY!

23
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,199
>> I DON'T HAVE THAT NECKLACE,

24
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,367
AND I'M REALLY NERVOUS.

25
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,119
>> Jeff: BACK AT CAMP, STEPHEN

26
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,328
THOUGHT HE COULD GET EVERYONE ON

27
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,413
BOARD TO VOTE OUT JOE.

28
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,498
>> I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO TAKE

29
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,333
OUT JOE SINCE DAY ONE.

30
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,501
>> Jeff: BUT SPENCER HAD PLANS

31
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:44,127
OF HIS OWN.

32
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:50,592
>> ABI, IF WE DON'T VOTE FOR

33
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:51,092
STEPHEN, I THINK YOU AND

34
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:51,718
WENTWORTH AND I AND KEITH ARE IN

35
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:52,135
A LOT OF TROUBLE.

36
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,219
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

37
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,220
SPENCER GOT HIS WAY, 11th

38
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,431
PERSON VOTED OUT, AND FIFTH

39
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,265
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

40
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,183
>> WOW, NICE.

41
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,518
>> Jeff: SHOCKING JEREMY, TASH

42
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,186
AAND KIM.

43
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,479
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

44
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:02,812
>> THANK YOU.

45
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,105
>> Jeff: EIGHT ARE LEFT.

46
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:14,657
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

47
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,200
Captioning funded by CBS

48
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:15,784
and FORD.

49
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:18,870
We go further, so you can.

50
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:20,580
>> IT WAS A CRAZY ONE.

51
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:21,581
>> YOU DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS

52
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,332
GOING TO, LIKE, MESS UP NUMBERS

53
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,251
AND STUFF?

54
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,211
OR YOU JUST FEEL LIKE--

55
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,712
>> I DO FEEL LIKE IT.

56
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,297
I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE THE GAME IS

57
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,965
ONCE AGAIN, LIKE, REALLY OPEN.

58
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:31,883
>> OKAY.

59
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,843
>> FOR THE FIRST TIME, I MADE A

60
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:34,302
MOVE.

61
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,262
I BLINDSIDED STEPHEN, BUT I

62
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,182
CAN'T BECOME THE GAME BOT WHO

63
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,433
TREATS PEOPLE LIKE PAWNS.

64
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,436
SO EVEN IF JEREMY ISN'T SOMEONE

65
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,604
I WANT TO GO TO THE END WITH,

66
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:45,730
HE'S PROBABLY SOMEONE I NEED TO

67
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,066
KEEP A RELATIONSHIP WITH.

68
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,859
>> I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

69
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:50,235
WE'RE STILL GOOD.

70
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,361
>> WE'RE STILL GOOD.

71
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,153
LIKE, I STILL TRUST YOU.

72
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,238
>> I DIDN'T WANT STEPHEN GONE.

73
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,907
NOW, I FEEL LIKE I'M IN TROUBLE.

74
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,243
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH

75
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:58,535
ANYTHING.

76
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,828
>> WE SHOULD JUST, LIKE, FIGURE

77
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,037
OUT WHERE THINGS STAND.

78
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,163
IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE IT HAS

79
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:02,372
BEEN.

80
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,498
IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE PICKING UP

81
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,207
THE PIECES,UN.

82
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,291
>> THAT'S TRUE.

83
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,752
THESE VOTING BLOCKS JUST KEEP

84
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,379
MOVING AND I DON'T LIKE THAT

85
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:09,587
FEELING.

86
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,505
I LIKE TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF

87
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,883
EVERYTHING AND KNOW WHAT'S GOING

88
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:14,843
ON.

89
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,135
>> THIS IS WHAT I'M THINKING.

90
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:16,427
>> OKAY.

91
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,264
>> IF JOE DOESN'T WIN, HE'S

92
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:19,681
DEFINITELY GOING.

93
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,015
>> OH, YES.

94
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,559
>> EVERYBODY'S ON BOARD WITH

95
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:22,767
THAT.

96
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:23,518
>> YES!

97
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,646
AFTER TRIBAL, I FELT COMPLETELY

98
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:27,480
BLINDSIDE AND I HAD REALIZED I

99
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,440
NEED TO BE IN CONTROL OF MY

100
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:29,691
DESTINY.

101
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,192
SO WE GET RID OF JOE.

102
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,195
THAT'S FOUR WOMEN.

103
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,947
AND GIRLS HAVE AN UPPER HAND.

104
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,240
>> I WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT ALL

105
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:37,407
WOMEN.

106
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,324
>> BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTS TO.

107
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,492
>> RIGHT.

108
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,119
>> AND THEN BEFORE THEY REALIZE

109
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,746
WHAT'S HAPPENING, WE ALREADY

110
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,414
GOTTEN THEM.

111
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,707
>> I'M SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW.

112
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:45,999
I LOVE THIS.

113
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:46,749
>> ARE YOU--

114
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,877
>> I'M IN, YEAH.

115
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,253
OUT OF THE BLUE, KIMMI

116
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,713
APPROACHES ME WITH THIS PLAN OF

117
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,673
AN ALL-GIRLS ALLIANCE.

118
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:54,299
IF WE VOTE OUT JOE AND THE GIRLS

119
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:58,052
ARE WILLING TO WORK TOGETHER,

120
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,262
THERE'S NOTHING THAT JEREMY,

121
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,389
KEITH, OR SPENCER COULD DO.

122
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,099
>> IF ONE OF THE GUYS GO, THEN

123
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:04,434
IT'S GOING TO BE FOUR WOMEN THAT

124
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,561
CAN RULE.

125
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:07,520
SO, IT'S GOT TO BE JOE.

126
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:07,812
>> I AGREE.

127
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,981
>> THEN WE CAN GET OUT SPENCER.

128
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:10,231
>> YUP.

129
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,524
>> WE CAN GET OUT KEITH.

130
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,066
>> YEAH.

131
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,400
>> AND JEREMY.

132
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:15,028
>> I DIDN'T COME OUT HERE AND

133
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,946
LEAVE MY FAMILY JUST TO BE

134
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,280
SOMEBODY'S PAWN.

135
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,949
I CAME OUT HERE TO WIN.

136
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,243
SO IT'S TIME FOR ME TO MAKE MY

137
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,579
MOVE.

138
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,439
>> Jeff: TASH AHOW DOES IT

139
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:53,441
FEEL TO HAVE LASTED 30 DAY?

140
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,360
>> JEFF, TO MAKE IT TO 30 DAYS,

141
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,779
I'M FEELING FANTASTIC.

142
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:58,321
>> Jeff: JEREMY, HOW HARD IS

143
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,699
IT TO PLAY A SECOND TIME AND

144
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,702
LEAVE YOUR LIFE BEHIND KNOWING

145
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,079
I'M OUT HERE FOR MY FAMILY?

146
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,789
>> I HAVE NO COMMUNICATION WITH

147
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:07,997
HOME.

148
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:08,706
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

149
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:14,045
I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'RE DOING.

150
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:14,337
WHATEVER.

151
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:14,837
>> Jeff: WOW, EVEN TALKING

152
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,172
ABOUT IT.

153
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,341
WELL, AS YOU GUYS KNOW, A BIG

154
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,761
PART OF "SURVIVOR" IS THE LOVED

155
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:22,720
ONE VISIT.

156
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,848
AND MOST OF THE TIME, WE DO

157
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,434
BRING YOUR LOVED ONES TO YOU.

158
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,478
NOT ALWAYS.

159
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:33,982
SOMETIMES WE DO SOMETHING

160
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,400
DIFFERENT.

161
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:39,070
TODAY, WE ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING

162
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,363
DIFFERENT.

163
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,823
TODAY WE BROUGHT YOUR LOVE TO

164
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,157
YOU.

165
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,076
>> OH, MY GOD!

166
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,245
>> OH, MY GOD!

167
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:47,578
>> OH, MY GOD!

168
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,789
OH, MY GOD!

169
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:50,873
>> I'M READY!

170
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:51,582
I'M READY!

171
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,458
>> Jeff: JEREMY, HERE'S YOUR

172
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:59,340
WIFE, VAL.

173
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:08,016
>> GO GET HER!

174
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,405
>> I KNEW IT!

175
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,450
>> SO VAL SAID, "IT'S A BOY."

176
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,702
I'M GOING TO HAVE A SON.

177
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,913
THAT'S WILD.

178
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:31,581
BUT I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO KNOW

179
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,583
RIGHT NOW.

180
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,709
THEY DON'T NEED TO KNOW.

181
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:35,877
>> Jeff: JEREMY THAT WAS, I

182
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,046
THINK, THE FASTEST SPRINT TO A

183
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:38,588
LOVED ONE I'VE EVER SEEN.

184
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:42,091
>> I MEAN, LIKE, THIS WHOLE

185
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,510
GAME, ALL I DO IS THINK ABOUT

186
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:44,761
FAMILY.

187
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:45,511
THERE IS NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT

188
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,388
THAN FAMILY.

189
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,182

DEAL TO ME.

219
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:56,666
AND IT'S SOMETHING I'VE

220

STRUGGLED WITH SINCE CHILDHOOD.

221
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,840

FEELING THAT WAY WITH SO MANY

223
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,511
PEOPLE THAT I'VE LOVED.

224
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,639
AND THE FACT THAT I DID SAY "I

226
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,060
CHANGE IS REAL.

HE NEVER REALLY SAID, "I LOVE

564
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:56,742

565
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,202
SO FOR HIM TO BE ABLE TO SHARE

566
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,287
THAT WITH ME WAS SOMETHING SO

567
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,540
SPECIAL AND, LIKE, AH!

568
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:04,291
I'LL REMEMBER IT FOR THE REST OF

569
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,751
MY LIFE.

570
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,211
I LOVE YOU UNCONDITIONALLY.

571
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,670
>> EXACTLY.

572
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:13,258
EXACTLY.

573
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,303
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ALL

574
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,596
THEIR PICKS?

575
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,180
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT OUR

576
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:18,347
PICKS?

577
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,306
>> I DON'T KNOW.

578
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:22,226
IT'S KIND OF WHAT I EXPECTED.

579
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,227
>> AH!

580
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,604
IT STILL SUCKS.

581
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:26,355
KELLEY CHOOSING WHO TO COME WITH

582
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:31,860
HER ON REWARD WAS, LIKE, THESE

583
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,111
TINY LITTLE SHANKS TO THE HEART

584
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,738
ONE BY ONE BY ONE.

585
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,074
I'VE NEVER FELT HEARTACHE LIKE

586
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:37,282
THAT.

587
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,700
I JUST HAD TO TAKE A MOMENT AND

588
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,619
LET ME HEART CATCH UP WITH MY

589
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:40,828
HEAD.

590
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,412
THERE'S NO OPTION AT THIS POINT

591
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,665
BUT FOR ME TO GET MY HEAD BACK

592
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,708
IN THE GAME AND DO EVERYTHING IN

593
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,334
MY POWER TO WIN.

594
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:51,380
I KNOW YOU PROBABLY STILL FEEL

595
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,214
WEIRD ABOUT STEPHEN, BUT IT WAS

596
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,174
THE THING AGAINST STEPHEN.

597
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,051
IT WAS NOT A THING AGAINST YOU.

598
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:59,221
>> BUT HOW DO YOU, LIKE, PROCEED

599
00:18:59,304 --> 00:18:59,429
FORWARD?

600
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,139
>> WELL, HOW DO YOU GUYS FEEL

601
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:01,723
ABOUT US IN THE FINAL THREE.

602
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,393
>> I'M DOWN WITH THAT.

603
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,811
FOR ALL THREE.

604
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:06,311
>> I'M IN.

605
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:06,562
>> I'M IN.

606
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,021
>> ABSOLUTELY.

607
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:08,397
THIS IS PERFECT.

608
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,275
I HAVE ONE OPTION TO GO WITH

609
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,943
SPENCER AND JEREMY TO THE FINAL

610
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:13,318
THREE.

611
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,237
AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE, THE

612
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,614
GIRLS WERE TALKING ABOUT AN

613
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,365
ALL-GIRL ALLIANCE.

614
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,242
SO I THINK I HAVE TWO VIABLE

615
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:20,492
OPTIONS.

616
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,536
>> SO WHAT'S THE NEXT MOVE?

617
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,328
>> HOW DO YOU GUYS FEEL ABOUT

618
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,455
JOE IN THE GAME NOW?

619
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,124
>> I THINK JOE IS SETTING

620
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,292
HIMSELF UP NICELY.

621
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,210
HE CAN SAY, "I NOT ONLY PLAYED A

622
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,545
PHYSICAL GAME.

623
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,422
I PLAYED A SOCIAL GAME.

624
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,882
I AM CLEARLY THE BIGGEST THREAT,

625
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,675
AND I'M STILL HERE."

626
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:37,843
SO WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

627
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,428
>> AT THIS POINT, I DON'T KNOW

628
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,512
HOW MANY CHANCES THERE ARE GOING

629
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,930
TO BE TO GET JOE OUT.

630
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,308
I LET ONE OPPORTUNITY GO BECAUSE

631
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,351
I HAD A BIG MOVE TO MAKE, AND I

632
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,897
NEEDED JOE'S HELP FOR IT.

633
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,356
BUT JOE IS A GUY WHO YOU GIVE

634
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,358
HIM AN INCH, HE WILL TAKE A

635
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:53,567
MILE.

636
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,236
HE GETS MOMENTUM, AND I'M DONE.

637
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,654
SO IT MAKES ALL THE SENSE IN THE

638
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,656
WORLD FOR ME, THE SECOND I GET

639
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,617
THE CHANCE, TO GET THIS GUY OUT

640
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,701
OF HERE.

641
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:24,556
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

642
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,147
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S

643
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:32,773
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

644
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:33,482
>> YES!

645
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,693
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,

646
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:36,944
SPENCER.

647
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,278
I MUST TAKE IT PACK.

648
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,864
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE IT

649
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:41,031
UP.

650
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:41,823
IT FEELS SO GOOD.

651
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:42,449
>> IT WILL FEEL GOOD AGAIN.

652
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,409
>> Jeff: I LIKE IT!

653
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,120
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

654
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,038
FOR GRABS.

655
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:48,664
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE

656
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,625
GOING TO BALANCE A WOODEN STATUE

657
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,834

00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,670
AT REGULAR INTERVALS, WE'LLED --

659

660
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,382
IT MORE DIFFICULT.

661
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:01,426
YOUR STATUE DROPS, YOU'RE OUT.

662
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,887
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS

663
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,347

LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL, WHERE

AND TODAY, IT IS THE FIRST MAN

670
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,778
AND THE FIRST WOMAN.

671

WE'LL DRAW FOR SPORTS AND GET

00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,058
ONCE WE GET HIM OUT OF HERE, THE

943
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,102
GIRLS ARE IN CONTROL OF THIS

944
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:36,311
GAME.

945
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:36,728
>> YOU WANT TO TALK?

946
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:39,188
>> YEAH.

947
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,523
>> CAN YOU GET UP?

948
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,026
>> YEAH.

949
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,445
>> RIGHT NOW, IT SUCTION BECAUSE

950
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:49,324
I DON'T HAVE IMMUNITY, AND I'M

951
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:49,574
EXHAUSTED.

952
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,743
BUT I WENT IN TO THE LAST TRIBAL

953
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:52,785
WITHOUT THE NECKLACE, AND I'M

954
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:53,828
STILL HERE.

955
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:55,747
SO I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT I

956
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,374
CAN DO IT AGAIN.

957
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,251
AT THIS POINT IN THE THE GAME,

958
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,085
LIKE, I'M THINKING WHO'S THE

959
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,754
MOST DANGEROUS PERSON TO JUST

960
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,006
GET TO THE END.

961
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,842
HANDS DOWN, ABI.

962
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:08,635
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

963
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:09,260
IN EVERYONE'S MIND, THEY WANT TO

964
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,095
SIT NEXT TO ABI.

965
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,889
AND WITH EVERY VOTE THAT SHE'S

966
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,015
NOT VOTED OUT, SHE BECOMES MORE

967
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,392
AND MORE DANGEROUS TO MAKE IT TO

968
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:16,893
THE END.

969
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,186
>> YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

970
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,604
SITTING NEXT TO ABI WOULD BE

971
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:19,896
EASY MONEY.

972
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,648
>> EXACTLY.

973
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:22,273
I WANT PLAYERS TO GO TO THE END.

974
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,566
>> YEAH.

975
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,568
I HEAR YOU.

976
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,237
WRIERKS WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS

977
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,198
I NEED ABI OUT OF THIS GAME AND

978
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,616
JEREMY'S A SMART GUY, SO I THINK

979
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,409
IT'S GOING TO STICK, AND I THINK

980
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,996
IT DID STICK.

981
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,164
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

982
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:41,334
BECAUSE, I MEAN, IT'S EASY TO BE

983
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,211
LIKE, "LET'S GET JOE OUT."

984
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:47,256
>> YEAH.

985
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,467
>> HERE'S THE THING.

986
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:53,096
THE GIRLS WANT TO DO AN ALL-GIRL

987
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:53,388
ALLIANCE.

988
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,682
BUT YOU GUYS HAVE TO TRUST IT

989
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,975
WILL NOT BE ALL GIRLS.

990
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,687
I'VE BEEN LOCKED IN SINCE DAY

991
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:00,853
ONE.

992
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,522
AND THAT'S IT.

993
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,190
>> I WAS PLANNING ON VOTING OUT

994
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:06,734
JOE, AND THEN TASHA TELLS ME

995
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,070
THIS TALK ABOUT AN ALL GIRLS'

996
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:09,320
ALLIANCE.

997
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:15,034
OH, MY GOD.

998
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,035
>> ARE YOU GUYS SERIOUSLY

999
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,245
NERVOUS ABOUT THIS ALL-GIRL

1000
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,621
THING?

1001
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:19,205
>> NO.

1002
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,165
I'M NOT NERVOUS ABOUT THE ALL

1003
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:21,374
GIRLS.

1004
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,418
IT'S JUST SO QUIET RIGHT NOW.

1005
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,335
>> IT IS A LITTLE CALM.

1006
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,086
>> IT'S NEVER THIS EASY.

1007
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,839
>> SO I TOLD JEREMY AND SPENCER

1008
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,173
ABOUT THE ALL-GIRL ALLIANCE

1009
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,633
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO RISK

1010
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,093
HAVING THEM FIND OUT ABOUT IT

1011
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,803
FROM SOMEONE ELSE.

1012
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,096
BECAUSE THAT WOULD CREATE

1013
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,681
DISTRUST.

1014
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:39,726
HOWEVER, ALL I DID WAS MAKE THEM

1015
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:40,977
SUSPICIOUS, WHICH COULD MEAN

1016
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:54,490
TROUBLE.

1017
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,075
>> I'M CONCERNED EITHER WAY.

1018
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,244
IF WE KEEP JOE, I'M TERRIFIED.

1019
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,079
IF WE GET RID OF JOE, I'M

1020
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,664
TERRIFIED.

1021
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,125
>> YEAH.

1022
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,376
OH, MY GOD.

1023
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,504
>> THE PROBLEM IS I'M NOT 100%

1024
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,089
CONVINCED THAT TASHA'S IDEA OF

1025
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,884
FINAL THREE WITH MYSELF AND

1026
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:13,217
JEREMY.

1027
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:13,843
TASHA MIGHT HAVE THE THOUGHT IN

1028
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,219
HER HEAD, I CAN BEAT AN ABI.

1029
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:18,306
I CAN BEAT A KIMMI.

1030
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,223
I CAN BEAT WENTWORTH.

1031
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,099
SO WE HAVE TO SQUASH THESE GIRLS

1032
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:23,519
BEFORE THEY GET ANYTHING

1033
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:23,770
STARTED.

1034
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:24,353
>> IF WE CAN GET KEITH, AND IF

1035
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,440
WE STILL HAVE JOE.

1036
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,067
>> BUT WHO'S THE FIFTH?

1037
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:29,400
WE NEED TASHA.

1038
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:32,403
>> WE'VE GOT TO LOCK HER IN,

1039
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:32,904
THEN.

1040
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:33,488
IF THOSE GIRLS TAKE OVER THE

1041
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:38,701
AME, H ME AND SPENCER, WE'RE ALL

1042
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:38,910
DONE.

1043
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,369
OUR GAMES ARE OVER.

1044
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,455
SO HAVING TASHA ON MY SIDE IS

1045
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,373
CRUCIAL RIGHT NOW.

1046
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:47,085
>> OKAY, SO, YOU VOTE OUT ABI.

1047
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,628
AND THAT LEAVES JOE IN THE GAME,

1048
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,170
AND THEN HE WINS OUT.

1049
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,215
>> YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO WIN

1050
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:52,882
OUT?

1051
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:56,177
>> YOU COULDN'T BEAT HIM TODAY.

1052
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,054
SPENCER COULDN'T BEAT HIM TODAY.

1053
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,889
JOE ESCAPED ONE TRIBAL COUNCIL,

1054
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:00,807
AND I DON'T WANT HIM TO ESCAPE

1055
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,182
ANOTHER ONE.

1056
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:05,019
BUT AT THIS POINT, IT'S A

1057
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:05,311
STALEMATE.

1058
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,063
>> WHAT IS THAT POWWOW ABOUT?

1059
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,314
>> ARE PEOPLE STILL WRITING JOE?

1060
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:10,691
>> I KNOW TASHA IS 100%.

1061
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,485
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO TRIBAL

1062
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,111
COUNCIL NOT KNOWING WHAT'S GOING

1063
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:14,612
TO HAPPEN.

1064
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:17,365
SO WE NEED TO COME TO AN

1065
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:17,615
AGREEMENT.

1066
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,991
WE'RE ANYTHING TO BE MAKING A

1067
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,576
MILLION-DOLLAR DECISION, AND I'M

1068
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:25,748
NERVOUS AS HELL ABOUT THAT.

1069
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:40,721
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

1070
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,182
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1071
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,394
KASS.

1072
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,312
SAVAGE.

1073
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,022
WIGLESWORTH.

1074
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:50,231
CIERA.

1075
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,275
AND FISH BACK, VOTED OUT AT THE

1076
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:56,279
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1077
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,531
JOE, ONE OF THE MOST DRAMATIC

1078
00:35:58,614 --> 00:35:59,866
MOMENTS IN "SURVIVOR" HISTORY

1079
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:02,368
TODAY WHEN YOU DROPPED.

1080
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,327
HOW ARE YOU FEEL?

1081
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,289
>> I'M OKAY.

1082
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,249
I'M NOT GREAT BY ANY MEANS.

1083
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,126
I MEAN, I'VE PUSHED MYSELF.

1084
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,252
YOU KNOW IN SPORTS, BUT NOTHING

1085
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,628
LIKE THIS.

1086
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,630
AND IT'S-- IT'S HUMBLING.

1087
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,216
I HAVE MY BREAKING POINT, TOO.

1088
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,593
>> Jeff: KIMMI, WHAT WAS IT

1089
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,969
LIKE WHEN YOU SAW THAT?

1090
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:22,722
>> I MEAN, IT WAS AN EPIC BATTLE

1091
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:23,306
BETWEEN THEM.

1092
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,266
I MEAN, JUST WATCHING IT, IT WAS

1093
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,017
JAW DROPPING.

1094
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,810
AND TO SEE SOMEBODY GO DOWN, I

1095
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,604
MEAN, IT WAS FRIGHTENING FOR US.

1096
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,980
>> Jeff: SO, WENTWORTH, ONCE

1097
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,982
YOU REALIZED HE'S GOING TO BE

1098
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,442
OKAY, HOW QUICKLY DOES YOUR

1099
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,028
BRAIN GO, ALL RIGHT, I GOTTA BE

1100
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:37,278
HONEST.

1101
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:37,695
I AM IN A GAME.

1102
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,322
>> YEAH, I MEAN, IT DEFINITELY

1103
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:39,989
CROSSES YOUR MIND.

1104
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,407
I MEAN, HE STOOD THERE UNTIL HE

1105
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,993
PASSED OUT.

1106
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,912
LIKE, HE COULD COTHAT IN ANY

1107
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,038
CHALLENGE AND BEAT ALL OF US TO

1108
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:47,330
THE END.

1109
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,832
I MEAN, IT HAD TO HAVE CROSSED

1110
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,375
EVERYONE'S MIND LIKE, HOLY CRAP.

1111
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,877
THESE GUYS WILL LITERALLY PASS

1112
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,419
OUT TO WIN A CHALLENGE.

1113
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,296
>> Jeff: JEREMY, ARE YOU ABLE,

1114
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,965
ALSO, TO SAY, BACK TO GAME MODE?

1115
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,175
DUDE DOES NOT HAVE IMMUNITY?

1116
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,509
>> YEAH, I MEAN, AS SOON AS YOU

1117
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:01,260
FIND OUT THAT HE'S ALL RIGHT,

1118
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,554
YOU START THINKING, ALL RIGHT,

1119
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,555
JOE, DOESN'T HAVE IMMUNITY.

1120
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,932
DO WE TAKE HIM OUT?

1121
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:06,515
BUT YOU HAVE A GAME PLAN, AND

1122
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,060
IT'S NOT JUST GOING TO CHANGE

1123
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,811
JUST BECAUSE JOE DOESN'T HAVE

1124
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:11,103
IMMUNITY.

1125
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,605
YOU CAN'T HAVE BLINDERS ON.

1126
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:15,066
BECAUSE THESE NEXT FEW VOTES

1127
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:15,858
ARE-- ARE CRUCIAL.

1128
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:16,359
>> CRUCIAL.

1129
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:16,984
>> UH-HUH.

1130
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:17,777
>> CRUCIAL!

1131
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,028
>> Jeff: AND, JEREMY, THIS IS

1132
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,489
WHERE THE INVOICE OF VOTING

1133
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,407
BLOCKS VERSUS ALLIANCES STARTS

1134
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,951
TO GET VERY EXPENSIVE, BECAUSE

1135
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,953
THE THING ABOUT AN ALLIANCE IS

1136
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:27,912
THEORETICALLY YOU CAN COUNT ON

1137
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:28,371
IT TO A CERTAIN POINT.

1138
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:29,747
THE THING.

1139
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,250
A VOTING BLOCK AS YOU GUYS HAVE

1140
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,542
BEEN EXPLAINING IT'S NEW EVERY

1141
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,335
KAY.

1142
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,586
>> AT SOME POINT, ESPECIALLY

1143
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,837
RIGHT NOW WHEN YOU'RE GETTING

1144
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,839
DOWN TO THE NITTY-GRITTY, YOU

1145
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,383
GOTTA START PICKING AN ALLIANCE,

1146
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,009
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO END UP

1147
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,970
ON THE BOTTOM OF THE VOTING

1148
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,263
BLOCK AT THE LAST PART OF THE

1149
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:46,472
GAME.

1150
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:46,931
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1151
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,349
>> Jeff: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN

1152
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,392
IN TERMS OF US GETTING READY TO

1153
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:49,600
VOTE?

1154
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,852
>> I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE KNOW WHO

1155
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,896
IS ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK RIGHT

1156
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,063
NOW.

1157
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:54,689
>> Jeff: DO YOU THINK EVERYONE

1158
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,149
KNOWS WHO IS ON THE CHOPPING

1159
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:57,358
BLOCK?

1160
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,651
>> I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE I AM, SO

1161
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,945
I'M GOING TO THROW MY HAND UP

1162
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:01,529
SAYING I AM.

1163
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,239
>> Jeff: ABI, FOR WHAT REASON?

1164
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,116
>> EVERY TRIBAL I FEEL THAT I'M

1165
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:05,908
ON THE BOTTOM BECAUSE OF THE

1166
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,702
CONNECTION I HAVE WITH WENTWORTH

1167
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:07,994
AND CIERA.

1168
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,453
I THINK THAT'S GOING TO KEEP ON

1169
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,247
HAUNTING US.

1170
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,373
>> WELL, I THINK YOU'RE A THREAT

1171
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,376
IN THE GAME BECAUSE EVERYONE

1172
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,503
WOULD WANT TO TAKE YOU TO THE

1173
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:17,795
END.

1174
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,714
SHE'S IN THE PERFECT SPOT TO

1175
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:20,381
MAKE IT PAST A VOTE, ANOTHER

1176
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,008
VOTE, ANOTHER VOTE.

1177
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:22,550
AND YET SHE'S STILL HERE.

1178
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,593
>> BUT I'M NOT CONFIDENT THEY

1179
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,303
WON'T BE GOING HOME TONIGHT.

1180
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,055
I DO FEEL THERE IS A

1181
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:28,389
POSSIBILITY.

1182
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,807
>> AND, YET, LOOK, SHE'S SITTING

1183
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,809
UP STRAIGHT, HAPPY AS A CLAM.

1184
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:32,476
>> Jeff: SPENCER, JOE BRINGS

1185
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,396
UP THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT WHO

1186
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,689
YOU MIGHT CRAG TO THE END

1187
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:37,940
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T WIN.

1188
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,900
THEY'RE STILL TAKING UP A SPOT

1189
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:40,901
IN THE FINAL THREE.

1190
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,111
AND IT MIGHT BE YOUR SPOT.

1191
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:42,528
>> EXACTLY.

1192
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,989
WHEN THIS PERSON THAT YOU'D LOVE

1193
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,449
TO SIT NEXT TO DOESN'T ACTUALLY

1194
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,617
HELP YOUR CHANCES OF GETTING TO

1195
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,535
THE FINAL THREE, THAT'S WHEN IT

1196
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,203
BECOMES A PROBLEM.

1197
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,038
>> Jeff: ABI WHAT, DO YOU

1198
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,414
THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN

1199
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:53,622
TONIGHT?

1200
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,791
IS THIS ALL A BUNCH OF NOTHING

1201
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:56,542
BECAUSE WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT'S

1202
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:56,792
HAPPENING.

1203
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,420
>> THERE IS A MOLD GOING ON AND

1204
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,963
IT'S AFFECTING THE OTHER

1205
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:01,213
PLAYERS.

1206
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,048
AND I THINK WE HAVE TO GET RID

1207
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,924
OF THE BAD APPLE.

1208
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:04,550
>> Jeff: AND, JOE WHAT, DO YOU

1209
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,635
THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN

1210
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:06,886
TONIGHT?

1211
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:10,139
>> I HOPE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT I

1212
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,307
SAID TODAY THAT I WAS GOING TO

1213
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,933
DO WHAT I SAID I WAS GOING TO DO

1214
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,852
STICK TO THAT PLAN AND WE

1215
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:15,436
CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD.

1216
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,604
BECAUSE IF NOT, IT'S GOING TO GO

1217
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:20,024
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.

1218
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,108
THE BIG THREATS IN THE GAME

1219
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,985
RIGHT DOWN THE LINE.

1220
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:23,611
IT ONLY TAKES FOUR AFTER THIS

1221
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,820
VOTE.

1222
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,322
AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE FOUR THAT

1223
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,991
YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY TRUST, YOU'RE

1224
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:33,496
GOING TO BE 8, 7, 6.

1225
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,456
>> Jeff: OTHER, IT IS TIME TO

1226
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,582
VOTE.

1227
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:43,172
WENTWORTH, YOU'RE UP.

1228
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,427
>> YOU'RE MOLDY.

1229
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:51,305
YOU GOTTA GO, AND, PLEASE, GET A

1230
00:39:51,388 --> 00:39:51,722
HAIRED CUT.

1231
00:39:51,806 --> 00:40:02,274
YOU LOOK LIKE A CLOWN.

1232
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,449
>> I HAVE THE TERRIFYING FEELING

1233
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,243
THAT THIS IS EITHER A WINNING OR

1234
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:28,342
A LOSING VOTE.

1235
00:40:28,425 --> 00:40:30,094
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1236
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:37,643
VOTES.

1237
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:40,020
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1238
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,105
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

1239
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:47,194
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1240
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:47,361
OKAY.

1241
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:47,945
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE

1242
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,572
DECISION IS FINAL.

1243
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:50,156
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE

1244
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:50,698
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

1245
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:51,198
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

1246
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,702
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1247
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:59,165
FIRST VOTE, JOE.

1248
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:03,335
ABI.

1249
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:03,794
TASHA.

1250
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,380
ONE VOTE JOE, ONE VOTE ABI, ONE

1251
00:41:06,463 --> 00:41:08,632
VOTE TASHA.

1252
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,758
JOE.

1253
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:16,348
TWO VOTES JOE.

1254
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:16,515
JOE.

1255
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,725
THAT'S THREE VOTES JOE, ONE VOTE

1256
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:22,730
ABI, ONE VOTE TASHA.

1257
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:23,564
12th PERSON VOTED OUT AND

1258
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:24,690
THE SIXTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

1259
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:24,857
JOE.

1260
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:42,291
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1261
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:44,501
>> Jeff: JOE, THE TRIBE HAS

1262
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,420
SPOKEN.

1263
00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:47,755
>> GOOD LUCK, Y'ALL.

1264
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,257
BOYS, BEST OF LUCK.

1265
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:57,598
>> Jeff: TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1266
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,058
WELL, THE QUESTION OF TONIGHT'S

1267
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:00,643
TRIBAL SEEMS TO BE WAS AN

1268
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,645
ALLIANCE FORMED TONIGHT, OR WAS

1269
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:05,481
THIS JUST THE PERFECT

1270
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,024
OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE OUT A BIG

1271
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:07,274
THREAT?

1272
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,108
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

1273
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,068
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1274
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:13,447
GOOD NIGHT.

1275
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:19,286
>> JEFF: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES

1276
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,538
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

1277
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:27,628
>> Jeff:NEXT TIME ON

1278
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,381
"SURVIVOR": AFTER A HUGE

1279
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:31,757
MINDSIDE, JEREMY AND SPENCER ARE

1280
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:31,966
WORRIED.

1281
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:32,800
>> I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED.

1282
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:33,801
>> I THINK WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

1283
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:38,430
>> I FEEL MY GAME SLIPPING AWAY.

1284
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:39,807
EXPWHR BUT BACKSTABBING ISN'T

1285
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:44,186
THE ONLY DANGER IN "SURVIVOR."

1286
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:44,353
OH!

1287
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:44,645
YOU OKAY?

1288
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:45,688
>> I NEED HELP!

1289
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,279
>> I HAVE NO REGRETS.

1290
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:53,821
I DON'T LEAVE ANYTHING BACK

1291
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,240
BEHIND ME AND SAY I COULD HAVE

1292
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:57,574
DONE THIS BETTER OR THAT BETTER.

1293
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:58,701
I TRIED TO PLAY THE BEST GAME

1294
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:01,453
THEY KNEW HOW, AND HAD SO MUCH

1295
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:02,997
FUN AND I WAS ABLE TO REACH SO

1296
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,249
MANY GOALS AND JUST GETTING MY

1297
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:06,834
DAD OUT HERE, THAT ALONE FOR ME

1298
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:10,045
WAS A MILLION-DOLLAR EXPERIENCE,

1299
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,130
AND I HAVE THE FANS TO THANK
