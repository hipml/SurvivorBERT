00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,585
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously,

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:03,169
on...

3
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,170
J.T. and Boston Rob go at

4
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:04,421
it hard.

5
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:05,839
<i>...Survivor:</i>

6
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:07,215
Coach takes a hard hit.

7
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:08,133
By day 12, it was all-out war

8
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:10,093
between the Heroes and the

9
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:10,385
Villains...

10
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:11,219
Whoa!

11
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:13,555
Stop, stop!

12
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:14,180
...and James was the latest

13
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,181
casualty.

14
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,559
But the biggest battle was back

15
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:18,768
at the Villains' camp.

16
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:19,936
Parvati was fighting for her

17
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:20,311
life.

18
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,439
>> Move your arms like this.

19
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,773
>> Parvati is the most

20
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,692
dangerous player on our tribe.

21
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:27,026
>> PROBST: Meanwhile, Russell

22
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:27,569
and Rob battled it out for

23
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:28,194
tribal supremacy.

24
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,196
>> It's personal with me and

25
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:30,989
Rob.

26
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:31,448
He thinks he's tough?

27
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,867
May the best man win.

28
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:34,909
>> PROBST: Russell believed he

29
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:35,410
was in an alliance with

30
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:37,120
Danielle and Parvati, and he had

31
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,456
the hidden immunity idol.

32
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,166
Rob believed he was aligned

33
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:44,043
with everyone else.

34
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,254
Rob jumps down on the final

35
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,046
piece!

36
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,506
Villains win immunity!

37
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,799
But when Rob led the Villains

38
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,009
to yet another victory, his

39
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,135
battle with Russell was

40
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,219
postponed.

41
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,473
Villains, congratulations.

42
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,098
While the Heroes were marching

43
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,642
into another vote, James'

44
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,936
injury made him a liability, and

45
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,521
Candice considered voting with

46
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,148
the outsiders, Tom and Colby,

47
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,316
to take him out.

48
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,650
>> You can't lug around dead

49
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,235
weight-- and James is a lot of

50
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,321
dead weight.

51
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,530
>> PROBST: But at Tribal Council

52
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,157
she played it safe and voted

53
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,533
with the majority to take out

54
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,409
Tom...

55
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,578
The tribe has spoken.

56
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,747
...making Colby the odd man out

57
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,708
in a tribe going nowhere fast.

58
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,043
15 are left.

59
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:42,310
Who will be voted out tonight?

60
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,312
>> Really?

61
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,189
>> At Tribal tonight, Tom went

62
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:49,275
home, and, uh... I voted for him

63
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,402
because there's no reason to

64
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,780
throw a vote away and make the

65
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,740
people that are going to be

66
00:01:55,824 --> 00:02:08,545
coming home tonight mad at me.

67
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,838
>> Everyone's annoyed with

68
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,005
Candice.

69
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,049
>> In reality, nobody trusts

70
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:13,883
her.

71
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,885
She was gunning for James.

72
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:16,427
I'm so sick of Candice right

73
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,555
now.

74
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:53,715
So... Candice has to go.

75
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:54,883
>> I'm just sitting around

76
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,342
and... thinking too much.

77
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,927
I don't want to be at your

78
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,220
throat, I don't want you to be

79
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,306
at my throat.

80
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,891
I've decided to have a

81
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,685
conversation with Rob to make

82
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,021
him think that I'm not after

83
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,189
him, which I am.

84
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,316
I don't care how strong he is.

85
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,526
I don't care who he is.

86
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,361
He's threatening Russell Hantz--

87
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,156
when you do that, you go.

88
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,240
>> A lot of people are mad,

89
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,408
though, that you went looking

90
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,409
for that idol... because we all

91
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,703
said nobody's gonna look for it,

92
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,163
and if they were, then you're

93
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,372
going to be marked.

94
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,583
>> I went looking for it, but...

95
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,209
if I get the next clue, I'll

96
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,461
find it, 'cause I'll go looking

97
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:39,052
for it again.

98
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:39,636
>> Russell's going to find out

99
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,596
soon enough that he's out of

100
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,056
his league.

101
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,307
I just did everything I could

102
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,850
to make him as more paranoid as

103
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,685
I could, to see he runs around

104
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,812
like a crazy man.

105
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,067
...but a lot of people are

106
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,151
mad that you went looking for

107
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:55,985
that idol.

108
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,153
They want your ass off.

109
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:58,154
He's not playing with the

110
00:03:58,237 --> 00:03:59,197
amateurs anymore.

111
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,406
He's playing with the big boys

112
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,741
now.

113
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:02,367
I'm just telling you, watch

114
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,494
your back, man.

115
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,040
>> Well, same thing for you,

116
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,708
man. (laughs)

117
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,835
Watch your back.

118
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:26,099

what does it mean for James?

139
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,250

money on the fact that there

141

Today you'll be competing as

keep you safe at tonight's

176
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,655
both tribes are going to Tribal

177
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,365
Council.

178
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:30,199

challenge separately.

185
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,418
Here's how it works.

186
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,669
Each person will be attached to

187
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,296
a long rope that is threaded

188
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,547
through a series of obstacles.

189
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,341
You'll climb over, crawl under,

190
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,634
maneuver around those obstacles

191
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,720
as you make your way to the

192
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,387
finish.

193
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,805
First person to the finish wins

194
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,141
individual immunity, is safe at

195
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,225
Tribal Council.

196
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,394
After both tribes have run this

197
00:07:58,477 --> 00:07:59,854
challenge, the two winners--

198
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:00,605
one from each tribe-- will then

199
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,816
square off in a showdown.

200
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,567
The winner of<i> that</i> challenge

201
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,612
wins for their tribe hot dogs,

202
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,906
fixin's, soft drinks, which you

203
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,783
will enjoy tonight as you

204
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:13,701
listen in on the other tribe's

205
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,828
Tribal Council.

206
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,164
So you not only win food, you

207
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,582
get insight into the dynamics

208
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,958
of the other tribe.

209
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:21,626
>> Wow.

210
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:22,710
>> PROBST: A lot at stake.

211
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:25,046
One thing of note.

212
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,964
Coach, J.T. and Tyson all

213
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,549
competed in this challenge in

214
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,508
their season.

215
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,635
J.T. and Tyson went on to the

216
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,720
final; Tyson ultimately won

217
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,263
this challenge.

218
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:34,847
All right, we'll rock, paper,

219
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,933
scissor to see who goes first.

220
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,060
We'll get started.

221
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:42,563
Villains won the rock, paper,

222
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,190
scissor.

223
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,483
They want the Heroes to go

224
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,235
first.

225
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,361
Fighting for individual

226
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,695
immunity.

227
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,989
Survivors ready?

228
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,699
Go!

229
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,993
You got to follow the rope

230
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:56,744
through the course.

231
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,205
Your body has to go wherever

232
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,665
that rope goes.

233
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:01,958
You're going to have to throw

234
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,459
yourself through this course if

235
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,753
you want a shot at winning.

236
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,464
James, even with a bad knee, is

237
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,091
fighting to stay in this.

238
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,342
>> Man!

239
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,344
>> Wow.

240
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,387
>> PROBST: Definitely affecting

241
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,180
his mobility, but not his

242
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,723
spirit.

243
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,142
Amanda now in the lead.

244
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,644
Candice right there in it.

245
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,646
There are going to be a lot of

246
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,648
scrapes, bumps, bruises when

247
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,775
this is over.

248
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,699
James now in the lead in this

249
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:35,783
challenge.

250
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,118
Who would have ever predicted

251
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,077
this?

252
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,161
>> Amazing!

253
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,497
>> PROBST: It is J.T., Candice,

254
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,916
Rupert and James.

255
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,168
Colby still stuck in the middle.

256
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,044
Hung up.

257
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:51,007
Amanda falling behind.

258
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,341
Candice through the first

259
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,845
section before anybody else!

260
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,513
J.T. now through the first

261
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:58,097
section.

262
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,641
It's J.T. and Candice!

263
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,893
Individual immunity on the line.

264
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,228
Only way to make sure you're

265
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,771
safe tonight is to win this.

266
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,064
Amanda now in the second

267
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:07,898
section.

268
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:08,899
Rupert now in the second

269
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:12,320
section.

270
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,030
Candice wins individual

271
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,157
immunity!

272
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,038
>> Candice is the only thing

273
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:22,747
stopping Colby from going home

274
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,124
next, and when she won immunity

275
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:25,875
he had to be thinking, "You know

276
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,501
what?

277
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:31,213
I just done me in."

278
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,006
>> PROBST: Candice,

279
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,467
congratulations.

280
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,801
Candice safe at tonight's

281
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,178
Tribal Council.

282
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,387
I'll take a hug.

283
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:38,929
Everybody else unbelt, take

284
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,931
your spots on the bench,

285
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,183
Villains, we'll get you hooked

286
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:42,975
up.

287
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:47,688
Nice work.

288
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,066
All right, next round.

289
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,568
Villains now fighting for

290
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:53,944
individual immunity.

291
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,988
Survivors ready?

292
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,699
Go!

293
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,993
See if they learned anything by

294
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,455
watching the Heroes do it first.

295
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:08,709
Rob and Tyson throwing

296
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:09,835
themselves through this

297
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,253
challenge.

298
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,922
Russell squirming through this

299
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:16,384
fairly quickly.

300
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,927
Danielle trying to make a go of

301
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,929
it.

302
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,765
Parvati's right there in it.

303
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,101
Sandra stuck early.

304
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,020
Jerri struggling to get through.

305
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:28,729
You cannot be timid in this

306
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,772
challenge.

307
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,025
It will not work.

308
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,111
Right off the bat, it is Rob,

309
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,030
Tyson, Russell.

310
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,325
Parvati doing very well.

311
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,868
Sandra making no progress at

312
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,871
all.

313
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,540
Coach launches himself through

314
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:48,457
this.

315
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,043
Rob's still fighting.

316
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,962
Danielle trying to stay in it.

317
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:53,796
Parvati is in this.

318
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,841
It's Parvati, Russell, Tyson,

319
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,718
Rob and Coach leading the way

320
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,848
right now.

321
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:04,890
Boston Rob is through the first

322
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,892

Tyson now through to the second

324
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,438

327
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:14,984

Boston Rob, Tyson, Russell

329
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:19,405
battling for individual

330
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,324
immunity!

331
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,076
Boston Rob is through!

332
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,204
Boston Rob wins immunity!

333
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,668
Rob, congratulations.

334
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:33,878
Rob is safe at tonight's Tribal

335
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:34,879

336
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,422
You will now take on Candice in

337
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:37,423
a showdown.

338
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,424
Unhook.

339
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:41,552
We'll move on to the showdown.

340
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:43,929
Here we go.

341
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,264
For the showdown round, we have

342
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,099

Winner of this challenge wins

346
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,980

347
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,106
you will enjoy tonight while

348
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,232
listening in on the other

349
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,026
tribe's Tribal Council.

350
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:57,985
Survivors ready.

351
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:58,986
Go.

352
00:12:59,069 --> 00:12:59,987
>> Go, Boston Rob!

353
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,822
>> You got it, Rob!

354
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,741
>> You got it, Rob! You got it!

355
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,160
>> Focus, Candice!

356
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,203
>> PROBST: We've added a third

357
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,288
level to this challenge, and it

358
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:09,872
is three times as high.

359
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,458
This is going to be a lot more

360
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,501
difficult than the first round.

361
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:14,502
>> Come on, Candice!

362
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:15,503
>> It's all you, Rob.

363
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,504
It's all you.

00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,963
>> PROBST: Rob with a bit of a

365
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,798
lead, but Candice right on his

00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:20,007
tail.

367
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,427
Both Rob and Candice are safe

368
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,970
for the vote tonight.

369
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,263
They're fighting now to win food

370
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,264
for their tribe.

371
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,265
>> Go steady, girl!

372
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,266
>> Go...

373
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,267
>> Keep it going, Rob.

374
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,435
Keep it going.

375
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,145
>> PROBST: Not only do you win

376
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:33,938
food, you win the right to get

377
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,856
a little insight into the

378
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,567
dynamics of the other tribe.

379
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,568
>> Awesome, Rob!

380
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,569
You look great.

381
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,570
>> Rob, go.

382
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,613
>> PROBST: Rob still with the

383
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:43,656
lead, but Candice still right

384
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:44,657
there.

385
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,699
Candice has not lost much

386
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:46,700
ground.

387
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:47,701
>> Right on his butt.

388
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,744
You're right on his butt.

389
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:49,745
>> Come on, Candice!

390
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:50,746
You're right there.

391
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:51,872
Don't give up now! Come on!

392
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:52,873
You're right on him.

393
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:53,874
>> PROBST: A lot of support from

394
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:54,875
both tribes.

395
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:55,876
>> Great job, Rob! Great job.

396
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,877
>> Good job.

397
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:57,878
You're doing awesome!

398
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:58,879
>> Really good job.

399
00:13:58,963 --> 00:13:59,880
>> Come on, girl!

400
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:00,965
This is your honeymoon, girl!

401
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:01,966
>> Come on, Candice!

402
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:02,967
You're right there!

403
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:03,968
>> Your honeymoon night, baby.

404
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:04,969
Come on, girl.

405
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,011
>> Steady, girl.

406
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,012
>> Stay focused! Yes!

407
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:07,972
>> Nice!

408
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:08,973
>> PROBST: Rob getting very

409
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:09,974
close now.

410
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:10,933
>> Good job, Rob! Good job, Rob!

411
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:11,934
>> PROBST: Candice got to pick

412
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:12,935
it up.

413
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:13,936
>> Come on, Rob.

414
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:14,979
You got it, man. It's all you!

415
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:15,980
>> PROBST: Rob with the last

416
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,107
move.

417
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,317
Rob wins for the Villains!

418
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,318
(cheering and applause)

419
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,486
Villains will eat tonight at

420
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,028
Tribal Council.

421
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,781
>> You get the biggest hot dog!

422
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:28,450
Yeah.

423
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,660
>> PROBST: All right, so here's

424
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:30,703
how it's going to work.

425
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,328
Villains, you will go to Tribal

426
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,455
Council first, where Boston Rob

427
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,456
has immunity, cannot be voted

428
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,457
out.

429
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,875
After you've completed your

430
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,627
Tribal Council, we will serve

431
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,421
you hot dogs and soft drinks as

432
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,089
you listen in on the Heroes'

433
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,591
Tribal Council, where Candice

434
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,633
has immunity, cannot be voted

435
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,634
out.

436
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,218
Grab your stuff, head back to

437
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:46,927
camp.

438
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:51,181
See you both at Tribal Council.

439
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,016
>> I can certainly see where the

440
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,310
tribe might decide I'm the weak

441
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,145
link, so my gut tells me I'll be

442
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,438
going home tonight.

443
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,897
But you never know what your

444
00:14:58,981 --> 00:14:59,231
future holds.

445
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,275
There's so much that's truly up

446
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,612
to those you're playing with.

447
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,372
>> Boston Rob saves the day!

448
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,373
>> Hot dog!

449
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,001
(whooping)

450
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,587
>> Nice work, Rob!

451
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,838
>> Ooh, I beat a girl.

452
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:23,839
>> I know.

453
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:24,840
>> I feel so... (roars)

454
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:25,883
>> Feel like a big man?

455
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,176
Feel like a big man?

456
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,969
>> Job well done.

457
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,471
>> I went into that immunity

458
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:31,847
challenge thinking, I have to

459
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,891
win this one, and then Rob wins!

460
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,684
And I'm, like, "What?! No!"

461
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,310
Rob having the immunity necklace

462
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,479
puts him in a big position of

463
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,480
power.

464
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,481
>> ...like the other day.

465
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,649
>> Gather round, gather round.

466
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:42,650
>> What is it?

467
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,651
>> Settled on Parvati,

468
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,652
everybody?

469
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:45,653
>> Yeah.

470
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,654
>> Oh, yeah.

471
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,696
>> But we have to make sure they

472
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,697
think it's Russell so that he

473
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,698
plays the idol.

474
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,699
(indistinct chatter)

475
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,910
>> Yeah.

476
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,912
>> Russell sucks me this way,

477
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,538
Tyson and Boston Rob pull me

478
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,706
this way.

479
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,749
You know, I'm totally the

480
00:15:58,832 --> 00:15:59,500
middleman.

481
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,209
I'm smack dab in the center of

482
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,461
two alliances, but we all know

483
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,213
that the dragon slayer is a man

484
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,881
of his word, and when he says

485
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:07,174
he's going to go this direction,

486
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,592
come hell or high water, that's

487
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,176
who I'm voting for.

488
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,177
I'm voting for Parvati.

489
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,221
>> Let's get her out of here.

490
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,222
I'm over it.

491
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,350
>> Yeah!

492
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,899
>> Just be careful, man, because

493
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:25,734
I'm telling you, if you really

494
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,236
don't have that idol, you need

495
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,237
to go get it.

496
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,656
>> I don't have it.

497
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,283
>> Well... it's been real.

498
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,284
>> So, you're-you're telling me,

499
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,369
uh...

500
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,537
>> I'm telling you...

501
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,162
>> ...if I don't find the idol,

502
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,206
they'll vote for me tonight?

503
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,499
>> Better to play with me than

504
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,084
against me.

505
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,086
>> Boston Rob tells me, "It's

506
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,631
better to play with me than

507
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,299
against me."

508
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,050
Oh, really?

509
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,386
I believe I'm going to get him

510
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,556
to eat them words.

511
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,227
>> Rob told me it's going to be

512
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,062
me.

513
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,063
I ain't stupid.

514
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,398
They're going to vote Parvati.

515
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,233
But this is what I want to do.

516
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,902
I want to put Tyson's name down.

517
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,195
I want to give you the idol

518
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,322
tonight.

519
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,534
If it doesn't work, I go home,

520
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,745
but I ain't that stupid.

521
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,956
They're trying to blindside you.

522
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,092
>> I needed an A-plus

523
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:35,262
performance today, and it didn't

524
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,513
happen.

525
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,974
James-- with a brace and all--

526
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:41,810
managed to beat me.

527
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,979
So, uh, not an impressive

528
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:48,150
showing, uh, for me today.

529
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,611
Well, I just want to say one

530
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:51,695
thing, guys.

531
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,739
I know I'm going home tonight,

532
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,908
so there's no... there's no need

533
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:56,492
for any scrambling or anything

534
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,203
like that.

535
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,704
There's absolutely no hard

536
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,122
feelings on my part.

537
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,500
So let's just have a good,

538
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,543
relaxed afternoon and go on in

539
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,669
there tonight.

540
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,379
I say we give them as little

541
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,672
information as we can.

542
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,800
They're going to be sitting in.

543
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,680
I see the pecking order, and

544
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,474
since Candice had sealed up

545
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,100
immunity, I'm the next one to

546
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,144
go...

547
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,354
Enjoyed it, Rupe.

548
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,272
...so I just said, "Listen,

549
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,732
enjoy our afternoon, head to

550
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,192
Tribal Council tonight."

551
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,612
Um... and I meant it.

552
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,459
...I haven't had a lot of fun,

553
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,877
I mean, I still love this game,

554
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,004
you know?

555
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,048
>> Yeah.

556
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:53,674
>> Granted, I still think I can

557
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,299
kick your ass.

558
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,300
>> Yeah.

559
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,303
>> But you-you the Great Colby.

560
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,722
>> It wasn't too good today,

561
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,933
that's for sure.

562
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,312
>> Right.

563
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:14,111
>> You know what I'm saying?

564
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,112
>> I hear you.

565
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,154
>> Colby doesn't want to be

566
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,155
here.

567
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,282
There's no way that's the Colby

568
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,367
of old-- one of the baddest

569
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,660
competitors ever.

570
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:22,703
He has not done anything.

571
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:23,370
It is bring... almost brought me

572
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,371
to tears.

573
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,456
It's like my Superman sucks.

574
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,584
All his muscles are gone, so

575
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,918
it's very disappointing just to

576
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,545
see a grown man give it up like

577
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,798
that.

578
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,302
>> We're losing our team.

579
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,345
>> I mean, Colby's a good guy.

580
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,346
>> I know.

581
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,347
>> I know.

582
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,391
>> But even with James' leg, my

583
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,685
foot, Colby was last.

584
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:47,686
>> I'm just... I'm really

585
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:48,312
shocked that Colby hasn't really

586
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,313
pulled through in anything yet.

587
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,314
You know?

588
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,273
>> I know.

589
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,026
>> But, still, James is hurt.

590
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,069
>> We just got to decide which

591
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,738
one of these is going to suit us

592
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:58,739
best, because even the...

593
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,782
You know, we all had an alliance

594
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,783
with James, but...

595
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,367
I mean, even James knows, at

596
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,494
this point, we have to win.

597
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,505
>> He's a competitor.

598
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,548
Like, no matter what will

599
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,883
happen, he will give his all

600
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:18,467
until we win, but we do need

601
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,468
to...

602
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,427
>> But see...

603
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,470
>> But if you're giving your

604
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,847
all, and your knee blows out,

605
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,349
our five has to be the strongest

606
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,725
possible five we could have.

607
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,060
We just have to think, you

608
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,061
know...

609
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,270
>> We have to think who's been

610
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,313
overall best competitor, given

611
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,482
the circumstances right now.

612
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,441
>> Mm-hmm.

613
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:37,569
>> Is what we have to do.

614
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:44,993
>> Well, how is it going to help

615
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:45,994
me? I mean...

616
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:46,995
>> I'm serious.

617
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:47,579
And you can't steal any more

618
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,330
bananas when we come to camp.

619
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,331
>> Steal any more bananas?

620
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,332
What the ...

621
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,291
>> You're taking bananas when

622
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,292
we come into camp.

623
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,293
>> Everybody eats bananas.

624
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:53,710
What does that mean?

625
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,379
>> James, you take three of

626
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,380
them.

627
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:57,381
>> Yeah. I'm...

628
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,382
>> You're pissing people off.

629
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,383
I'm just telling you what's

630
00:20:59,466 --> 00:20:59,675
going on.

631
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,592
James just has to prove that

632
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,135
he's okay.

633
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,136
They're also mad about it,

634
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,221
'cause James, like...

635
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,222
He tends to take a lot of

636
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,223
bananas 'cause he's a big guy.

637
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,599
Like, he's hungry, obviously,

638
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,601
but you know, you're out here

639
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,894
with no food-- it's a big deal

640
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:11,895
to people.

641
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:12,896
>> Everybody eats bananas.

642
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,897
It's so...

643
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:14,898
>> Yeah, but when you get a

644
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:15,941
banana, you get one for everyone

645
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:16,984
else.

646
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:17,985
It's, like, an etiquette.

647
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:18,986
>> Really?

648
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,154
>> Yes.

649
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,155
>> I mean, I understand.

650
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,156
Whatever.

651
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:23,782
>> Well, I want to know exactly

652
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,617
what you can do, because if you

653
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,868
show them, you're fine, then

654
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:27,869
you're fine.

655
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:28,954
They want you here.

656
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,247
Everyone wants you here.

657
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,958
But if there is a chance that

658
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,252
you're not okay...

659
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,712
>> Well, yeah, there might be,

660
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,337
but, uh... I don't know.

661
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,338
It's up to y'all.

662
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,339
>> Ugh.

663
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,467
>> I'm tired of the talking.

664
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,305
>> What's up?

665
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:50,642
>> James wants to show us

666
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,435
that he's tough.

667
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,061
>> Oh, God.

668
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:53,687
Are you serious?

669
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,398
(Rupert chuckles)

670
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,025
>> Who am I racing?

671
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:58,567
>> If you're racing me, you

672
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,359
already won.

673
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,444
(laughing)

674
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:03,321
>> We're about to have a race.

675
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,614
He's going to show us that

676
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,616
his leg is okay.

677
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,784
Who do we keep?

678
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:08,493
James, who is fighting to stay

679
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,453
in the game?

680
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,495
Or Colby, who's ready to walk

681
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,415
out.

682
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,416
>> So I'm running in this

683
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:14,750
thing, huh?

684
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,417
>> Yeah, I damn sure ain't

685
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,460
running by myself!

686
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,462
(Rupert laughs)

687
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,131
I wanted to prove to y'all that

688
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,257
I'm all right.

689
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,259
Straight up. I mean...

690
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:25,594
> I don't want to see James go.

691
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,388
James is a hundred percent ally

692
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,432
on my side.

693
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,059
Colby is not.

694
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,435
I'm just gonna say, "Ready, go."

695
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,937
James is a fighter.

696
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,522
Colby is not.

697
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,524
James is<i> power.</i>

698
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,984
Ready?

699
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,195
Colby is not.

700
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,072
Go!

701
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,615
(Rupert grunting)

702
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,325
>> Damn it!

703
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,118
(Rupert laughing)

704
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,119
>> You all right?

705
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:51,745
>> Damn it!

706
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:52,746
You got me!

707
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:55,248
Nah, I'm good. It don't hurt.

708
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:55,791
>> James is not the kind of

709
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,583
person that's gonna say, "You

710
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,835
know what, I don't think I can

711
00:22:58,919 --> 00:22:59,544
go anymore."

712
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,088
You'll never know it until the

713
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:01,630
man's in a stretcher that he

714
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,381
was hurt.

715
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,674
>> You still would have beat me.

716
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,592
>> We have to see the big

717
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,011
picture here, look outside of

718
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,430
our friendships and find...

719
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,183
the winning combination.

720
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,935

721
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:15,769
banana?

722
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:22,109

>> Yes, my love?

725
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:34,746
>> No.

726
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,622
We need to split the vote.

727
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,582
I'm telling you, three of us

728
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,377
vote for Parvati, three of us

729
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:40,794
vote for Russell.

730
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,671
The three of them are going to

731
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,798
put somebody up, probably you.

732
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:47,008
I'm telling you, if we vote

733
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,885
three and three and there's a

734
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,637
tie, then there's a revote.

735
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,098
That means either one of those

736
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,224
two are going home.

737
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,309
If he plays the idol, then she's

738
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:56,601
going home.

739
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,104
If he gives her the idol, he's

740
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,313
going home.

741
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,273
Do you understand?

742
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,983
We can't lose.

743
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,484
You can't lose that way.

744
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,528
This other way, it's too risky.

745
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,113
I was just thinking to myself,

746
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,656
you know, Tyson's one of my

747
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,324
allies, and if it were me that

748
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:11,908
didn't win immunity they'd be

749
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,077
coming after me, and I know

750
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,287
they're coming after him, and I

751
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,538
was just thinking of a way so

752
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,497
that Russell doesn't get the

753
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,875
better of us if he does have the

754
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:20,041
idol.

755
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,918
>> It's Parvati first option,

756
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:22,711
Russell second option.

757
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,880
>> Basically, I threw out an

758
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,715
insurance policy, if you will.

759
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,175
There's no way they can backdoor

760
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:28,800
us with the idol, and we'll all

761
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:32,262
be safe.

762
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,055
As long as we split our votes,

763
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,474
one of them two goes home.

764
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,225
>> That's it.

765
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:37,809
>> I think the vote's going to

766
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:38,685
be pretty... pretty

767
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,687
straightforward tonight.

768
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,564
Rob, myself, Sandra, we're

769
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,649
voting for Russell.

770
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,650
Courtney, Coach and Jerri are

771
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,111
voting for Parvati.

772
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,196
>> Don't sweat it.

773
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,323
I'm telling you.

774
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:52,866
>> It's not rocket science, but

775
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,534
I don't have immunity, and

776
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,161
anytime I don't have immunity I

777
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,330
feel a little uneasy.

778
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,081
Let me see you for a second,

779
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:00,665
Tyson.

780
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,876
Let me tell you something.

781
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,549
>> I know.

782
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,051
>> And I just wanted to tell you

783
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,552
I'll do what I have to do to

784
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:12,928
stay in the game.

785
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,013
There's nothing I can do to

786
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,015
help her.

787
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,683
So I'm going to vote for

788
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:18,934
Parvati.

789
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,560
>> Yeah, you need to.

790
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,687
>> And then... that'll be it.

791
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,522
She'll go home.

792
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,149
You know, if there's any way I

793
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,567
could've tried to save her, I

794
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,653
would have, but I started

795
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,363
thinking, you know, I got to

796
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,656
play this game for myself.

797
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:33,573
>> Okay.

798
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,242
When Russell came and told me

799
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,451
that he wanted to vote out

800
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:37,494
Parvati, I thought it was

801
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:37,953
actually an excellent

802
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,121
opportunity maybe to swap my

803
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:40,705
vote to Parvati.

804
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:44,084
I mean, I want her out.

805
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,044
>> Man, I don't like doing it,

806
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,088
but... got to.

807
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,548
>> I hope there's not a revote,

808
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,716
but I just want to get it over

809
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,426
with and get some hot dog in my

810
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:53,635
mouth.

811
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,761
>> All right, man.

812
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,972
>> Yep. We're tight, dude.

813
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,098
>> You know, the smartest thing

814
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:59,432
for them to do is make it a

815
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,475
three-way tie.

816
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,102
That would force the idol.

817
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:02,727
Then they can play however they

818
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,730
want to play on the second vote.

819
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,024
That would be a genius move.

820
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:11,611
I don't know they're that smart.

821
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,821
I don't know if it would be the

822
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,657
right thing giving Parvati the

823
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,950
idol.

at least one person in here

he's really charming and he's

888
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,739

00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:22,922
that.

951
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:26,718
Parvati.

952
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:27,135
>> Are you serious?

953
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,178
>> Mm-hmm.

954
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,936
>> Thank you.

955
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,063
I guess I'm playing it.

956
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:46,029
Such a gentleman.

957
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,655
>> PROBST: The rules of<i> Survivor</i>

958
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,198
state that if a hidden immunity

959
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,326
idol is played, then any votes

960
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,994
cast against that person will

961
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,454
not count, and the person with

962
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:55,121
the next highest number of votes

963
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,624
will be voted out.

964
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:58,166
This is, indeed, a hidden

965
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,168
immunity idol.

966
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,002
Any votes cast for Parvati will

967
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,504
not count.

968
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,591
This is a bold move by Russell.

969
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,718
I'll read the votes.

970
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,181
First vote...

971
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,308
Russell.

972
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:19,145
Russell.

973
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,272
Two votes Russell.

974
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,402
Parvati.

975
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,529
Does not count.

976
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,408
Parvati.

977
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,535
Does not count.

978
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,038
Parvati.

979
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,248
Does not count.

980
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,458
We're still at two votes

981
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:43,378
Russell.

982
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,879
Parvati.

983
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:50,259
Does not count.

984
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,844
Tyson.

985
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,262
That's two votes-- Russell, one

986
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:57,016
vote-- Tyson.

987
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,226
Tyson.

988
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,352
We're tied.

989
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:00,561
Two votes-- Russell, two votes--

990
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,104
Tyson.

991
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:05,441
One vote left.

992
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,901
Sixth person voted out of

993
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:08,152
<i>Survivor: Heroes vs.</i>

994
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,530
<i>Villains...</i>

995
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,657
Tyson.

996
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:22,208
>> Oh, my God.

997
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,043
>> PROBST: Tyson, the tribe has

998
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:28,840
spoken.

999
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:31,968
Time for you to go.

1000
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,226
Well, that was definitely a

1001
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,853
crazy Tribal Council.

1002
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:42,437
In a moment, we're going to

1003
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,355
bring in the Heroes for their

1004
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,857
Tribal Council, which you will

1005
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,399
get to listen in on while

1006
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,109
enjoying hot dogs and soft

1007
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,193
drinks.

1008
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,903
I'll give you a moment to move

1009
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,156
your torches, we'll get started.

1010
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:01,456
>> Oh, man, I have nobody to

1011
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,290
blame but myself.

1012
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,834
I was the victim of my own

1013
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:05,918
stupidity.

1014
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:06,544
Russell probably gained a little

1015
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,379
bit of respect and a little bit

1016
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,839
of power by his risky move

1017
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:10,840
today.

1018
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:11,466
Giving the idol to Parvati was

1019
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,134
kind of a shocker.

1020
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,427
It ended up being my demise.

1021
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,219
I wish I would have stuck to the

1022
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,220
split vote.

1023
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,263
I would have come out

1024
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,264
victorious, and Russell would

1025
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:19,265
have gone home.

1026
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,266
What you gonna do?

1027
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:23,394
I'm still pretty awesome.

1028
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,117
>> PROBST: Heroes getting your

1029
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,244
first look at the new Villain

1030
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,245
tribe.

1031
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,789
Tyson voted out of tonight's

1032
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,332
Tribal Council.

1033
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,958
All right, Heroes, as you know,

1034
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,335
part of the reward of today's

1035
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,586
challenge-- the Villains earned

1036
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:49,295
the right to sit in and listen

1037
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,672
in on your Tribal Council and

1038
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,925
enjoy hot dogs and soft drinks.

1039
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,009
(thunder rumbling)

1040
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:55,593
You guys can remove the covers

1041
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:58,429
and get started.

1042
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,850
>> Damn.

1043
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:03,851
(rain falling)

1044
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:04,852
>> Don't drop the buns.

1045
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:05,853
>> This is so evil.

1046
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:06,854
>> Wasn't our idea.

1047
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,022
>> Buns.

1048
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:09,023
(laughter)

1049
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:10,983
>> PROBST: Rupert, you haven't

1050
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,318
taken your eyes off that food,

1051
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,611
even while I'm asking you the

1052
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:14,612
question.

1053
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:15,905
>> No. I would have already had

1054
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,406
a couple of them dogs down.

1055
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,407
(rolling thunder)

1056
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,408
(loud, rumbling thunder)

1057
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,244
>> Yes, at least it's raining on

1058
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:25,039
y'all parade.

1059
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,749
>> PROBST: Rupert, sitting this

1060
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:27,333
close to the entire tribe of

1061
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,627
Villains, it's kind of a

1062
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,962
reflection of where we're at in

1063
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:31,963
this game.

1064
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:32,463
This tribe is dwindling.

1065
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:36,551
They're still full, so to speak.

1066
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,094
>> Literally and physically,

1067
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:38,386
they are.

1068
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,596
You know, the line between Hero

1069
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,222
and Villain is so blurred right

1070
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,307
now.

1071
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,433
The Villains are showing the

1072
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,143
Heroes how the hell this game is

1073
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,186
supposed to be played.

1074
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,354
>> PROBST: James, let's talk

1075
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,147
about today's challenge.

1076
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,983
There's a big sort of question

1077
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:52,358
surrounding you.

1078
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,277
Was there any talk about, "You

1079
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,278
did great, man.

1080
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,071
I'm so glad we kept you," or was

1081
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:58,406
there even a question?

1082
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,407
>> There were questions.

1083
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,325
And then, I had to race J.T.,

1084
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,077
and I lost, so I gave up...

1085
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,245
>> PROBST: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1086
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,122
You raced J.T.?

1087
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,748
>> I really want the best for

1088
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,416
the tribe, and I don't want to

1089
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,585
obligate anybody to keep me over

1090
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,627
here, so, I'm like this.

1091
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,170
"Let's go get it, let's have a

1092
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,172
race."

1093
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,756
Well, I sucked, and the dude

1094
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,842
from Alabama beat me.

1095
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,635
>> PROBST: Amanda, to be fair, I

1096
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,928
would think a lot of people

1097
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,221
would lose, in a foot race, to

1098
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,222
J.T.

1099
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,223
>> It's something to consider,

1100
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,725
because if we have a challenge

1101
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,393
tomorrow, that's running.

1102
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:30,271
I mean, it's on everyone's mind.

1103
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,314
>> PROBST: Colby, the last few

1104
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:32,690
Tribal Councils, you've been on

1105
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:33,608
the outside of the

1106
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:34,650
conversations, you've been in

1107
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:35,693
disagreement with the vote, and

1108
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:36,736
you've said, "Sooner or later,

1109
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:37,737
it will be me."

1110
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,280
What do you do in a game like

1111
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,281
this?

1112
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,574
Can you scramble?

1113
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,492
>> I just went back to camp and

1114
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:44,869
sat down and had a conversation

1115
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,495
with James about how bad we both

1116
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,455
want to be in this game, 'cause

1117
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,291
we're the two guys in question.

1118
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,334
>> PROBST: Did you get the

1119
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,376
feeling from James that he

1120
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,420
definitely wanted to still be in

1121
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,421
this game?

1122
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:56,547
>> Absolutely, and he asked me

1123
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:57,423
the same thing.

1124
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,508
>> PROBST: So, James, you

1125
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:00,509
weren't sure.

1126
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,553
>> This is pretty much one of

1127
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:03,846
the baddest survivors ever

1128
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,847
growing up.

1129
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:05,848
>> I'm not that old!

1130
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:06,432
>> But you know what I mean!

1131
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:07,350
(laughter)

1132
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,351
Watching the show forever.

1133
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,686
I get here, he got slammed by

1134
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,687
the dragon slayer.

1135
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,022
Picked up and brought in the

1136
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:13,689
van.

1137
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:14,315
Today, he got beat by a cripple

1138
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,317
and fat dude on an obstacle

1139
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,318
course.

1140
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,361
It's like finding out Superman

1141
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,403
was in a big girdle.

1142
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,072
You see the muscles, and you get

1143
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,323
up close, and it's nothing but a

1144
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,324
fat suit.

1145
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,117
So, I'm, like, "Honestly, do you

1146
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:25,493
want to be here?

1147
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,453
'Cause if not, I'll stay here,

1148
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,496
'cause I like it here."

1149
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,039
Some of us are doers, and some

1150
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,040
of us are sayers.

1151
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,083
I'm more of a doer.

1152
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,125
Like, they told me today,

1153
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,418
there's such a thing as a banana

1154
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,419
etiquette.

1155
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,545
>> PROBST: Banana etiquette?

1156
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,214
>> If you go get a banana, you

1157
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,465
have to ask every person who's

1158
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:40,883
in your vicinity if they would

1159
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:41,884
like a banana.

1160
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:42,885
(laughter)

1161
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:43,511
Which is great, but in my world,

1162
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,805
if your ass is hungry, you go

1163
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:46,806
get a banana.

1164
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:49,308
(laughter)

1165
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,394
>> PROBST: Colby, what's it like

1166
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,562
to hear James say, it's like

1167
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,439
seeing Superman is wearing a fat

1168
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,524
suit?

1169
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,900
>> I mean, hearing that's

1170
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:58,526
certainly not as bad as living

1171
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,318
it.

1172
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,444
You know, that's the worst.

1173
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,571
I mean, it's a reality.

1174
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:03,572
It's a reality.

1175
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,157
Up to this point, I have not

1176
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:05,700
performed as well as I would

1177
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:10,871
have hoped to.

1178
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,164
>> PROBST: All right, it is time

1179
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,874
to get to the vote, which means,

1180
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:14,917
Villains, finish what's in your

1181
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:15,918
mouth...

1182
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:16,961
>> Ha-ha!

1183
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:17,962
>> PROBST: Grab your torches,

1184
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:21,090
head back to camp.

1185
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,388
>> Oh, my God, there's bread up

1186
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,516
there.

1187
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,564
>> PROBST: All right, Candice,

1188
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:37,648
you have the individual immunity

1189
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:38,649
necklace.

1190
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,650
>> Keeping it.

1191
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:40,651
>> PROBST: Cannot vote for

1192
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:41,652
Candice.

1193
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,195
Everybody else is fair game.

1194
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,196
It's time to vote.

1195
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,575
Rupert, you're up.

1196
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,524
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1197
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,736
votes.

1198
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,703
Once the votes are read, the

1199
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:33,704
decision is final.

1200
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,081
The person voted out will be

1201
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,123
asked to leave the Tribal

1202
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,124
Council area immediately.

1203
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,252
I'll read the votes.

1204
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:46,342
First vote-- Colby.

1205
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,220
James.

1206
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:49,804
One vote-- Colby, one vote--

1207
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:53,557
James.

1208
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:54,558
James.

1209
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,352
Two votes-- James, one vote--

1210
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:59,313
Colby.

1211
00:39:59,396 --> 00:39:59,522
James.

1212
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,524
That's three votes-- James, one

1213
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:06,153
vote-- Colby.

1214
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,196
Seventh person voted out of

1215
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,572
<i>Heroes vs. Villains--</i> James.

1216
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,615
That's four.

1217
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:10,908
That's enough.

1218
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:13,160
You need to bring your torch.

1219
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,958
>> Bye, babe.

1220
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,045
>> PROBST: James, the tribe has

1221
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:23,587
spoken.

1222
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:27,800
>> Yes, sir.

1223
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:28,843
>> Have a shot for us.

1224
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:29,635
>> Oh, I'm going to be good and

1225
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:33,639
drunk in the next five minutes.

1226
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:39,478
>> PROBST: Well, from the sounds

1227
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:40,813
of tonight's Tribal Council, an

1228
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,273
alliance was broken, and

1229
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,650
hopefully, a tribe was unified.

1230
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,819
Grab your torches, head back to

1231
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:47,820
camp.

1232
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:51,031
Good night.

1233
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,258
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1234
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:10,801
from our next episode.

1235
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:16,891
>> PROBST: Next time on

1236
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:17,892
<i>Survivor.</i>

1237
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,101
Without his idol, nothing can

1238
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,394
save Russell from the wrath of

1239
00:41:20,477 --> 00:41:21,395
Rob.

1240
00:41:21,478 --> 00:41:22,396
>> He's dangerous.

1241
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,440
Anybody that gives away immunity

1242
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:25,065
and leaves himself blank-- it's

1243
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:25,608
like a suicide bomber.

1244
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:26,650
You can't stop someone like

1245
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,651
that.

1246
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,737
If they don't care about their

1247
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,280
own fate in the game, that's a

1248
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,907
wild card.

1249
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,992
He'll do anything.

1250
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:40,873
>> I have banana etiquette.

1251
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:41,874
That's just a little bit too

1252
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:42,875
much.

1253
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,210
But hopefully, they can finally

1254
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,170
pacify Colby into actually being

1255
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:49,423
a teammate, and actually having

1256
00:41:49,506 --> 00:41:50,424
the team together.

1257
00:41:50,507 --> 00:41:51,634
Hopefully, they'll do better.

1258
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:52,635
But it's a game.

1259
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:53,761
It was fun.

1260
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,387
I just happened to have bad luck

1261
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,430
on this thing with injuries.

1262
00:41:56,513 --> 00:41:58,057
And they got me a little bit

1263
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,141
earlier than they should have.
