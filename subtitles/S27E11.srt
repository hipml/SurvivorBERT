1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:01,668
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:01,751 --> 00:00:01,960
"SURVIVOR."

3
00:00:02,043 --> 00:00:03,670
AFTER 26 DAYS, TWO THINGS WERE

4
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:03,920
CERTAIN.

5
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:04,504
KATIE WAS ALONE AT THE BOTTOM.

6
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:07,716
>> I'M NOW SO LOAN IN THIS GAME.

7
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,426
>> Jeff: AND CIERA AND LAURA

8
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,386
WERE THE LAST PAIR IN THIS GAME.

9
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:12,262
>> DID YOU THINK WE'D BE THE

10
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,555
LAST COUPLE?

11
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,724
>> Jeff: BUT CIERA'S ALLIANCE,

12
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,350
THE TADHANA 5, CAME UP WITH A

13
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,018
PLAN TO BREAK UP HER AND HER

14
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:19,185
MOM.

15
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,145
>> I'M GOING TO TELL YOU

16
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:21,104
SOMETHING AND YOU'RE NOT GOING

17
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,188
TO BE SUPER HAPPY.

18
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,064
>> YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE MY MOM.

19
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,150
>> Jeff: FORTUNATELY FOR THEM,

20
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,234
SEE CARE A WAS ON BOARD.

21
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,068
>> IF MY MOM NEEDS TO GO IN

22
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,320
ORDER FOR ME TO WIN THE GAME,

23
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,196
THAT'S SOMETHING TO LOOK AT.

24
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:30,530
>> I LOVE YOU.

25
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:31,865
>> LOVE YOU.

26
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:32,449
>> Jeff: BUT THE PRESSURE OF

27
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,409
VOTING OUT HER MOM WAS TAKING

28
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:34,784
ITS TOLL.

29
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,410
>> I MEAN, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE

30
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:36,161
TO VOTE MY MOM OUT.

31
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,788
I CAME INTO THIS, LIKE, WANTING

32
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:42,625
TO SPLIT THE END WITH MY MOM,

33
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:43,460
BUT --

34
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,170
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

35
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:46,212
CIERA MADE THE TOUGHEST AND MOST

36
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,549
EMOTIONAL VOTE OF THE SEASON.

37
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,009
11th PERSON VOTED OUT OF

38
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:55,138
SURVIVOR: BLOOD VS. WATER,"

39
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,724
VOTING OUT OTHER MOM.

40
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,476
SENDING HER BACK TO REDEMPTION

41
00:00:59,559 --> 00:00:59,726
ISLAND.

42
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,227
LAURA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

43
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,438
SEVEN ARE LEFT, WHO WILL BE

44
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:23,041
VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

45
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,918
>> SORRY I CRIED.

46
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,169
>> LOOKS LIKE EVERYONE INCLUDED

47
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,379
CIERA VOTED FOR HER MOM.

48
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,173
SO I'M SURPRISED THAT CIERA

49
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,466
CHOSE WATER OVER BLOOD.

50
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,301
BUT SYRIA A HAS A PLAN AND I

51
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,553
DON'T THINK HER MOM WAS PART OF

52
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:35,720
IT.

53
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:36,304
>> I DON'T KNOW, LIKE, I'M

54
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,347
WEIRDLY OKAY WITH IT.

55
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,557
I KNEW THAT IT WAS GOING TO

56
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,726
HAPPEN EVENTUALLY.

57
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,187
TONIGHT WAS REALLY ROUGH.

58
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,814
IT WAS NOT EASY HAVING TO WRITE

59
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:48,691
MY MOM'S NAME DOWN BUT I'VE

60
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,276
PROVEN 100% THAT I'M TRUSTWORTHY

61
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,402
IN MOVING FORWARD.

62
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,237
I HOPE PEOPLE TAKE ME SERIOUSLY

63
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,280
IN THE GAME AND WANT TO WORK

64
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:54,823
WITH ME.

65
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,325
>> CIERA, I PRAERB@WHAT YOU DID

66
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:57,534
TONIGHT.

67
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,994
I KNOW NOBODY HAD TO PUT A VOTE

68
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,038
DOWN THAT WAS AS HARD AS IT WAS

69
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:02,914
FOR YOU.

70
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,707
CIERA WRITING HER MOM'S NAME

71
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,501
DOWN IT WAS HARDEST VOTING

72
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,794
POSITION OF THE GAME SO FAR.

73
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,462
BY DOING THAT, SHE'S SHOWING

74
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:09,712
LOYALTY.

75
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:10,296
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT MAKES

76
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,339
ME SCARED OF HER.

77
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,216
I CAN SEE SHE'S PLAYING THE GAME

78
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,385
PRETTY HARD.

79
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,137
I THINK SHE'S UNDERESTIMATED BY

80
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,513
A LOT OF PEOPLE AND WILL BE

81
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:23,101
DANGEROUS.

82
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,820
>> SO FUNNY, I'M BOTH NERVOUS

83
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:34,737
AND EXCITED.

84
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,448
NERVOUS THAT IT'S KATIE BUT I'M

85
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,410
ALSO EXCITED IF IT'S KATIE.

86
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:40,618
>> MOM?

87
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,580
>> KATIE?

88
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,748
OH!

89
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:45,915
HONEY!

90
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:46,791
>> OH!

91
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,543
>> OTHER MOM.

92
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,671
>> IT'S NOT KATIE!

93
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,923
>> I HEAR A LITTLE VOICE GOING

94
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:54,132
"MOM?"

95
00:02:54,215 --> 00:03:01,097
AND I'M LIKE, OH, IT'S KATIE!

96
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,391
BUT NO, IT WAS LAURA M.

97
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:07,604
BACK ONCE AGAIN TO REDEMPTION

98
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:07,937
ISLAND.

99
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,647
>> CIERA TOOK ME TO THE BEACH

100
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,440
AND SAID "MOM, THEY'RE GOING TO

101
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,276
VOTE YOU OUT UNLESS YOU CAN DO

102
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:13,568
SOMETHING."

103
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,070
AND THEN SHE HAD TO PUT MY NAME

104
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:16,279
DOWN.

105
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:16,487
>> WOW.

106
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,322
>> I'M HAVING A HARD TIME

107
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:20,158
DEFINING HOW I'M FEELING ABOUT

108
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,326
CIERA WRITING MY NAME DOWN

109
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:24,245
BECAUSE IT SUCKS THAT I'M HERE,

110
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,331
IT SUCKS THAT CIERA HAD TO DO

111
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:26,539
THAT.

112
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,416
IT SUCKS THAT SHE DID THAT.

113
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,292
BUT I'M PROUD OF HER.

114
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,960
I MEAN, SHE'S PLAYING THE GAME.

115
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:31,419
>> IT WAS JUST TOUGH.

116
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,378
IT WAS REALLY TOUGH.

117
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,924
WE WERE THE ONLY ONE LOVED ONE

118
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:36,549
COUPLES AND THEY WERE THREATENED

119
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,301
BY ME STILL.

120
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,761
WHICH THEY'RE STUPID, MONICA'S

121
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,054
WINNING THE CHALLENGES AND TYSON

122
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,472
IS FLYING UNDER THE RADAR.

123
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,974
>> TYSON IS SO -- HE'S RUNNING

124
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:45,808
IT!

125
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,269
WHY ISN'T ANYBODY VOTING HIM

126
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:53,691
OUT?

127
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:32,105
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

128
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,564
WE'LL NOW BRING IN THE

129
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:38,653
COMPETITORS FOR TODAY'S DUEL.

130
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:41,447
VYTAS, TINA AND LAURA VOTED OUT

131
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,242
FOR THE SECOND TIME AT THE LAST

132
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,704
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

133
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,289
SO, LAURA, THE LAST VOTE WE

134
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:53,167
SHOWED AT TRIBAL SAID "MOM."

135
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,502
CIERA VOTED YOU OUT OF THIS

136
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:54,711
GAME.

137
00:04:54,794 --> 00:05:02,635
SHE VOTED HER MOM OUT.

138
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:08,641
>> I'M PROUD OF HER.

139
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,350
WE KNEW AT SOME POINT ONE OF US

140
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,020
WOULD HAVE TO VOTE THE OTHER ONE

141
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:12,311
OUT.

142
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,604
I JUST DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GOING

143
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,065
TO BE SO SOON, AND IT'S OKAY.

144
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,108
>> SORRY!

145
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,484
>> IT'S OKAY.

146
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,737
I'LL COME BACK.

147
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,280
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LAURA, IF

148
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,573
YOU WANT BACK IN THIS GAME,

149
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,115
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE

150
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,533
SURE YOU FINISH BEFORE EITHER

151
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,368
TINA OR VYTAS.

152
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,369
TWO PEOPLE WILL MOVE ON, ONE

153
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:28,578
WON'T.

154
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,872
FOR TODAY'S DUEL, YOU'RE GOING

155
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,457
TO RACE TO REMOVE FOUR COLORED

156
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,876
CUBES FROM A LONG NET TUNNEL.

157
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,669
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL FOUR YOU MUST

158
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,047
STACK THEM SO THERE ARE NO

159
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,425
REPEATING COLORS ON ANY SIDE.

160
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,427
FIRST TWO TO FINISH LIVE TO SEE

00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,762
DAY 28 IN THIS GAME.

162
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,015
THE LOSER IS OUT FOR GOOD AND

163
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,433
WILL JOIN ARAS ON THE JURY AS

164
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:50,850
THE SECOND MEMBER.

165
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,852
IN ADDITION, THE WINNER OF THIS

00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,437
DUEL DECIDES WHO GETS THE CLUE

167
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,481
TO THE LOCATION OF THE HIDDEN

168
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:57,231
IMMUNITY IDOL.

169
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,192
IT IS BECOMING A BIGGER AND

170
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,526
BIGGER STORY EVERY SINGLE DAY.

171
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,487
TAKE YOUR SPOTS, WE'LL GET

172
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,325

ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,620
TWO WILL MOVE ON.

SURVIVORS READY?

176
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,916
GO.

177
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:18,628
>> LET'S GO, GUYS.

>> Jeff: THAT ROPE IS ROUGH.

179
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,964
IT'S GOING TO BEAT UP YOUR HANDS

180
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:22,632
BUT YOU CAN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT

181
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,425
RIGHT NOW.

182
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,551
VYTAS HAS HIS FIRST BOX.

LAURA HAS HER FIRST BOX.

184
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,806
IT'S VYTAS AND LAURA OUT TO A

TINA HAS HER FIRST ONE.

SHE'S ONE FULL BOX BEHIND.

203
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,630
THAT IS A LOT OF TIME.

204
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,341

RIGHT NOW IT'S TINA THAT'S IN

209
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:13,099

TINA STILL WORKING ON HER THIRD.

216
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,403
WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO NOW IS

217
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,028
ASSEMBLE THIS SO THAT THERE ARE

218
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,073

225
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:38,416

YOU'LL BE CERTAIN AND THEN

238
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,859
YOU'LL SPIN IT AROUND AND

239
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,444
REALIZE WHOOPS.

240
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,445
>> CRAP.

241
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,031
OKAY.

242
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,532
WILL THAT DO IT?

243
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:11,741
YELLOW.

244
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:12,074
THAT'S GOOD.

245
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,075

STICKING TOGETHER TRYING TO MAKE

278
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,829
SURE VYTAS DOES NOT ADVANCE.

279
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,164
ANYTHING HA K HAPPEN IN

280
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:00,623

THAT A GIRL.

287
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,090
>> Jeff: YOU DON'T WANT TO

288
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:09,799
LOSE RIGHT NOW.

289
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,133
NOBODY WANTS TO BE OUT OF THIS

290
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:11,592
GAME AFTER 27 DAYS.

>> PURPLE RIGHT THERE!

298
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,604
I THINK YOU'VE GOT IT.

299
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:27,149
>> I'M DONE.

300
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,734
>> I HAVE IT, TOO.

301
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,236

PURPLE, GREEN, RED YELLOW.

304

PURPLE GREEN RED YELLOW.

305

TINA HAS IT RIGHT.

306
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,787
TINA LIVES TO SEE ANOTHER DAY.

307
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,331
>> GOOD JOB.

308
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,625
VYTAS MISSED OUT BY LITERALLY

309
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:44,917
ONE SECOND.

310
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,669
>> SORRY, BUDDY.

311
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,253
I'M SORRY.

312
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:47,920
>> GOOD TRY.

313
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,714

>> Jeff: VYTAS WANTS NOTHING

315
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:51,966
DO WITH LAURA.

>> Jeff: LAURA,

318
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:57,138
CONGRATULATIONS.

319
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,098
COME OUT HERE FOR THE SECOND

320
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,475
TIME, GET IT DONE RIGHT AWAY,

321
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,227
LET EVERYBODY KNOW "I'M A

322
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:03,477
THREAT."

323
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,729
TINA, YOU SURVIVE BUT ONLY WITH

324
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,981
THE HELP OF THE OTHER MOM,

325
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:07,940
LAURA.

326
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,484
VYTAS, YOU CAME INTO THIS GAME

327
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,778
SEEKING SOME CONNECTION WITH

328
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,197
YOUR BROTHER AND SOME

329
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,325
RECOGNITION OF BEING YOUR OWN

330
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:17,533
PERSON.

331
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:18,784
AND YET YOU LEAVE HERE BECAUSE

332
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,037
TWO MOMS CONSPIRED AGAINST YOU

333
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,830
TO MAKE SURE YOU DIDN'T MOVE ON

334
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:23,748
AND IT WORKED.

335
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,750
>> THEY DON'T WANT ME TO MOVE

336
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:26,834
FORWARD BECAUSE I'M THREATENING

337
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:27,585
TO THEM.

338
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,337
THAT'S WHY ARAS AND I GOT VOTED

339
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:29,503
OUT.

340
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,380
WE'RE TWO HUGE THREATS IN THIS

341
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:31,547
GAME.

342
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,173
>> Jeff: WHAT DO YOU THINK

343
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,758
WILL HAPPEN WHEN YOU GO BACK

344
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:34,884
WITH HOME WITH YOUR RELATIONSHIP

345
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:35,760
WITH YOUR BROTHER.

346
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:36,677
HE'S BEEN VERY CLEAR HE WANTED

347
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:37,053
TO HEAL WITH YOU.

348
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:37,762
HE WANTED TO MOVE FORWARD.

349
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,764
>> I REMEMBER WHEN ARAS CAME

350
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,057
BACK THE FIRST TIME, NOBODY

351
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,892
COULD RELATE TO HIS EXPERIENCE.

352
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:43,392
LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT

353
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,685
HAPPENED OUT THERE, MAN.

354
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,728
NONE OF US COULD RELATE.

355
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,813
BUT GOING BACK TOGETHER WE HAVE

356
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,273
THIS SHARED EXPERIENCE AND IT'S

357
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,900
GOING TO BRING US A LOT CLOSER,

358
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:51,776
I'M SURE OF THAT.

359
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,403
>> Jeff: VYTAS, AFTER 27 DAYS

360
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,030
IN THIS GAME, YOUR TIME IS UP.

361
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,032
GRAB YOUR STUFF, TOSS YOUR BUFF

362
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,451
IN THE URN, WE'LL SEE YOU BACK.

363
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,410
LOVE YOU, BABY.

364
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:06,957
>> GOOD JOB, GUYS.

365
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:16,884
>> NAMASTE, BITCHES.

366
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:17,176
(LAUGHTER).

367
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,054
>> Jeff: LAURA, FOR WINNING

368
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,555
THIS DUEL YOU DECIDE WHO GETS

369
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,431
THE CLUE TO THE IDOL.

370
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,266
>> I'M GOING TO GIVE IT TO CIERA

371
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,351
AND SHE CAN DO WHATEVER SHE

372
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,060
WANTS WITH IT.

373
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,562
WHETHER BURN IT, KEEP IT, SHARE

374
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:28,729
IT.

375
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,357
>> ALL RIGHT, I THINK I'M GOING

376
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,609
TO BURN IT.

377
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:34,110
>> Jeff: ONCE AGAIN A CLUE

378
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:38,072
THAT COULD GIVE YOU SAFETY IN

379
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:38,989
THIS GAME.

380
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,909
THANKS, MOM.

381
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,786
ALL RIGHT, LAURA, TINA,

382
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,329
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU WILL LIVE

383
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:45,788
TO SEE DAY 28.

384
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,582
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

385
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,333
REDEMPTION ISLAND.

386
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:49,792
>> LOVE YOU.

387
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,961
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

388
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:52,753
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GUYS, GRAB

389
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:59,552
YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

390
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,903
YOU WORKED TOGETHER.

391
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:18,946
SEE YOU LATER VYTAS.

392
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,365
>> WITH SEVEN PEOPLE IN THE GAME

393
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:21,991
RIGHT NOW, THE NEXT VOTE AND THE

394
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,868
VOTE AFTER THAT ARE GOING TO BE

395
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:24,326
THE MOST IMPORTANT.

396
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,995
I HAVE TO GET PAST THIS NEXT

397
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,622
VOTE SO THE WISEST THING I CAN

398
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,542
DO RIGHT NOW FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

399
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:35,838
IS KEEP EVERYBODY AGAINST KATIE.

400
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,506
>> HEY --

401
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,215
>> WE'RE GOOD.

402
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,092
>> KATIE IS THE MOST DANGEROUS

403
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:40,968
PLAYER RIGHT NOW.

404
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,553
SHE HAS THREE JURY VOTES

405
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:42,803
ALREADY.

406
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:43,721
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO BE

407
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:44,472
CAREFUL OF.

408
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,516
SHE HAS ARAS, VYTAS' AND TINA'S

409
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:47,892
VOTE RIGHT NOW.

410
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:48,642
>> SEALED?

411
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,060
>> THAT'S ALMOST HALF THE VOTES.

412
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,353
WE CAN'T LET HER STICK AROUND.

413
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,980
>> WE HAD THE FIVE-PERSON

414
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:56,692
ALLIANCE, ME, CALEB, TYSON,

415
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:57,401
GERVASE CIERA.

416
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,319
WE COULD CONTINUE ALONG THE

417
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,112
COURSE OF THAT FIVE BY VOTING

418
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,198
OUT KATIE BUT YOU DO NOT WANT TO

419
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,159
BE THE GUY THAT WAITED TOO LONG

420
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,786
TO MAKE A MOVE AND GOT

421
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,287
BLINDSIDED YOURSELF.

422
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,707
THAT'S WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE

423
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,002
BE.

424
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,133
>> IT'S NOT GOING TO BE UP TO US

425
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,801
IF WE DON'T MAKE A MOVE.

426
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,094
WE CAN SIT ON OUR HANDS AND HOPE

427
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:24,929
THINGS WORK OUT OR WE CAN KIND

428
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:28,057
OF, LIKE, TRY AND TAKE ACTION

429
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:28,974
AND DO OUR OWN THING.

430
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,809
>> KNOCK IT OUT.

431
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:31,852
>> YEAH.

432
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:32,102
>> Jeff: .

433
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,855
>> IN ALL HONESTY, I FEEL LIKE

434
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,649
TYSON IS GOING TO BEAT US IN THE

435
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:36,815
END.

436
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,526
>> HE'S BEEN IN CONTROL OF THE

437
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,026
WHOLE GAME.

438
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:39,944
>> THE WHOLE THING.

439
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,987
>> AND IN THE END IT'S A HUGE

440
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,698
PIECE TO THE PUZZLE.

441
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,158
TYSON'S GOT A HELL OF A RESUME

442
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,451
TO PREACH TO THE JURY WHEN WE

443
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:47,743
GET THERE.

444
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,245
SO WE'RE THINKING MAYBE BEFORE

445
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,622
WE GET TO THE FINAL 5 WE'LL HAVE

446
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,249
TO PICK OFF SOMEBODY AND THAT

447
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:57,169
SOMEBODY'S GOING TO BE TYSON.

448
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,046
>> YOU'RE SAFE BECAUSE WE'VE GOT

449
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:03,092
TO TAKE TYSON OUT.

450
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,385
>> CALEB .

451
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,178
>> WE'RE GONNA BLIND SIDE HIM.

452
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,764
>> CAN I TRUST YOU LIKE ONE

453
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:09,348
MILLION PERCENT?

454
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:09,848
>> YES.

455
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,059
>> I'VE BEEN AT THE BOTTOM THE

456
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:12,476
PAST FEW ABLE TOES.

457
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,520
IT WASN'T LOOKING GOOD FOR ME.

458
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:18,732
I FEEL LIKE ONE OF THE HER MET

459
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:19,942
CRABS THAT WALK ALONG THE BEACH

460
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,402
AND YOU HAVE TO TRANSITION FROM

461
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,945
HOME TO HOME AND YOU DON'T HAVE

462
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,406
A SHELL AND THERE'S PREDATORS.

463
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,033
NOW I FEEL LOOK I'VE FOUND A

464
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:28,242
SHELL.

465
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:28,909
MY BEST OPTION IS TO WORK WITH

466
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:32,246
MY ORIGINAL TADHANA MEMBERS AND

467
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,122
GET RID OF TYSON SO I FEEL LIKE

468
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:39,336
MY OPTIONS ARE GETTING BETTER.

469
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,296
>> BOYS!

470
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:40,963
>> GIRL!

471
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,798
>> WELL?

472
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:44,466
>> WELL, WHAT'S NEW.

473
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,926
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS THINKING?

474
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,052
>> WE'RE THINKING IT'S TIME TO

475
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,305
SHAKE UP THE GAME A LITTLE BIT.

476
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,014
LIKE TYSON.

477
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,849
>> OKAY.

478
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,351
>> RIGHT NOW WE COULD USE KATIE

479
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,729
AS AN EXTRA TYSON VOTE.

480
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:57,938
>> SO THE FOUR OF US VOTE TYSON

481
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,733
AND TYSON GOES HOME BECAUSE THE

482
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,276
FOUR OF JUST A MAJORITY.

483
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,527
>> SMART.

484
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,486
US THREE FINAL THREE?

485
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:04,987
>> ABSOLUTELY.

486
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,324
>> WE CAN SO OUTSTART THESE

487
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,950
VETERANS RIGHT NOW.

488
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,243
CALEB SAID HE WANTED TO MAKE A

489
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,703
BIG MOVE AND HE WANTED TYSON

490
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:13,954
GONE AND THAT REALLY THROWS ME

491
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,581
OFF BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THESE

492
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,874
PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T PLAYED THE

493
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,626
GAME BEFORE ARE SO WILLING TO

494
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,419
FLIP AND FLOP ON EACH OTHER.

495
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,128
IT'S TOO SKETCHY FOR ME TO

496
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,838
INVEST IN THEM.

497
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:25,007
SO I TODAY CALEB AND HAYDEN WHAT

498
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,050
THEY WANTED TO HEAR BUT I DON'T

499
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,761
WANT TO WORK WITH PEOPLE LIKE

500
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:32,556
THAT.

501
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,270
>> AND I'M LIKE, IT DEPENDS.

502
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,272
AND HE GOES WE WANT TYSON GONE.

503
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,107
BUT I PROMISE YOU THIS: I AM

504
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,192
VOTING HOWEVER YOU'RE VOTING

505
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,985
FROM HERE ON OUT, I'LL VOTE

506
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:45,569
WHATEVER YOU WANT ME TO VOTE.

507
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:46,195
I DON'T WANT TO GO WITH THEM.

508
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,906
>> YOU HAVE A MUCH BETTER CHANCE

509
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:49,365
AGAINST ME.

510
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,741
>> I TOTALLY KNOW.

511
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,326
SO IF WE CAN JUST WORK TOGETHER

512
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:52,993
I HAVE YOUR BACK 100%.

513
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,746
>> I HAVE YOURS AND I TOLD YOU

514
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:56,455
THAT FROM DAY ONE.

515
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:57,539
>> BECAUSE I DO NOT TRUST THEM.

516
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,040
>> AND I DON'T, EITHER.

517
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:02,044
I TRUST GERVASE AND MONICA.

518
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,712
WILL GO WITH US BECAUSE I'VE

519
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,339
SHOWN HER MORE LOVE THAN ANYBODY

520
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:05,881
ELSE HAS.

521
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:07,341
SO THAT'S FOUR, WE GOT IT.

522
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,175
THEN WE'RE FLIPPING IT ON HAYDEN

523
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,510
OR CALEB.

524
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:09,718
>> DEAL.

525
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,887
>> I'M NERVOUS NOW.

526
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:12,471
I WAS HOPING TO MAKE IT TO SIX

527
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,807
BEFORE I MADE MY MOVE AND LOCKED

528
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,016
THE GAME DOWN BUT I MAY HAVE TO

529
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,476
LOCK IT DOWN EARLIER.

530
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,770
I TRUST MONICA AND I TRUST

531
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:20,979
GERVASE.

532
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,481
CIERA IS THE MAJOR WILD CARD

533
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:22,690
HERE.

534
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,232
I HOPE CIERA IS TELLING THE

535
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,484
TRUTH BUT IN THE END IT MAKES

536
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,069
MORE SENSE FOR ME TO GO THAT

537
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,862
DIRECTION ANYWAYS BECAUSE I NEED

538
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,072
CALEB AND HAYDEN OUT AND THE

539
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:38,122
SOONER THE BETTER.

540
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:44,420
>> LISTEN TO THIS: CIERA TOLD ME

541
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,256
THEY'RE PLANNING TO VOTE ME OUT.

542
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,049
SHE SAID CALEB CAME UP AND SAID

543
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,301
"YOU READY FOR A BIG MOVE?

544
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,053
WE'RE GOING TO DO IT, TYSON."

545
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,472
SHE SAID SHE TRUSTED ME ENOUGH

546
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,598
THAT ALL I HAVE TO DO IS TELL

547
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,934
HER WHO TO VOTE FOR AND SHE WILL

548
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:02,312
VOTE WITH ME EVERY SINGLE VOTE

549
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:06,150
UNTIL THE END.

550
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,985
>> SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO GET

551
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:08,902
RID OF CALEB?

552
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:09,570
>> YEAH.

553
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:10,696
HE'S SO LIKABLE.

554
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,239
HE'S THE CLEAR SHOT AT THE

555
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:12,448
MILLION.

556
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,198
>> CIERA SAYS THAT CALEB AND

557
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,826
HAYDEN ARE TARGETING TYSON AND

558
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,369
ARE GOING TO TRY TO VOTE HIM

559
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:17,536
OUT.

560
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,120
SO NOW WE'RE THINKING OKAY,

561
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,539
WE'VE GOT TO GET RID OF THEM.

562
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,082
TWO DAYS AGO THE FOUR GUYS, WE

563
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,001
HAD CONTROL OF THE GAME.

564
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,794
BUT NOW WE'RE ALL PLOTTING ON

565
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,296
EACH OTHER AND IT MAKES ME

566
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:27,546
NERVOUS.

567
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:30,090
BUT AS LONG AS CIERA JUST STICKS

568
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,509
WITH US WE SHOULD BE GOOD.

569
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,844
>> SNEAKY BASTARDS.

570
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:34,720
>> I KNOW.

571
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:35,888
I REALLY TRUSTED THEM.

572
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,306
I WAS READY TO GO TO THE FINAL

573
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,390
FOUR WITH THEM.

574
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,266
>> HAYDEN AND CALEB ARE TRYING

575
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,226
TO STIR THE POT AND THEY JUST

576
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,312
GOT SLOPPY.

577
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,772
AND WHEN YOU BREAK YOUR ALLIANCE

578
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,190
LIKE THAT THE GLOVES COME OFF

579
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,192
AND IT'S GONNA GET REAL DIRTY

580
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,068
AND UGLY.

581
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:50,944
TOMORROW'S GONNA BE HUGE.

582
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,239
>> YEAH.

583
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:09,755
>> GOOD MORNING!

584
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:10,964
>> GOOD MORNING.

585
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,884
YOU SLEEP ALL RIGHT?

586
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:14,384
LITTLE BIT?

587
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:25,354
>> LITTLE BIT.

588
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,815
>> YOU WANT TO COME GET

589
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:28,315
WITH ME?

590
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,191
>> OKAY.

591
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,150
>> WE'LL BE BACK.

592
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,028
BYE.

593
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:34,196
>> SHE WALKED RIGHT BY HERE AND

594
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,864
DIDN'T SAY A WORD.

595
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,324
>> SHE WON'T EVEN LOOK AT ME IN

596
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,534
THE EYE.

597
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:38,742
CIERA.

598
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:43,247
>> ME, EITHER.

599
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,083
>> LET'S SEE.

600
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,167
>> THERE IT IS!

601
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,461
>> SO WE STILL GOOD FOR --

602
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,963
>> WE'RE STILL ON FOR --

603
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:51,547
>> PROMISE?

604
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,422
>> YUP, PROMISE.

605
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,925
>> I GOT LIKE A WEIRD VIBE THIS

606
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:55,175
MORNING?

607
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:55,342
>> .

608
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,093
>> YOU DID?

609
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:56,677
THAT'S OKAY, WE'RE STILL ON

610
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,387
BOARD, ME AND GERVASE TALKED

611
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,389
ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT.

612
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,390
WE'RE GONNA DO IT.

613
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,307
STRAIGHT TO THE FINALS.

614
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,851
>> STRAIGHT TO THE FINALS.

615
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,394
>> I'M SO I DIDN'T GO ALONG WITH

616
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,311
HAYDEN AND CALEB.

617
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,897
I FEEL LIKE I MADE THE RIGHT

618
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,065
DECISION AND I TRUST TYSON

619
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:12,943
BECAUSE TYSON KNOWS, A, THEY'RE

620
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:13,652
GUNNING FOR HIM.

621
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,612
B, I SAVED HIM AND, C, HE

622
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,947
DOESN'T WANT TO BE SITTING NEXT

623
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,198
TO THEM AT THE END ANYWAY.

624
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,241
SO I FEEL LIKE I'M IN A GOOD

625
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,035
SPOT COME NEXT TRIBAL.

626
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,163
TRIBAL.

627
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:24,371
OKAY.

628
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,247
"ARE YOU ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY?

629
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,375
DO YOU HAVE A GRIP ON THIS GAME?

630
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,002
YOU'D BETTER HOLD ON FOR DEAR

631
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,211
LIFE OR TONIGHT YOU COULD LOSE

632
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,839
YOUR FLAME."

633
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:34,298
>> OOH!

634
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,215
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

635
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,886
>> THIS MORNING I SAW CIERA AND

636
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,012
TYSON RUN OFF INTO THE WOODS

637
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,638
THEN I STARTED THINKING, YOU

638
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,056
KNOW WHAT?

639
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,392
WHAT IF CIERA TELLS TYSON, HEY,

640
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,852
THOSE GUYS ARE GOING TO BLIND

641
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:47,102
SIDE YOU.

642
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:48,854
AND I STARTED TO GET PARANOID

643
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,898
BECAUSE I REALIZE IF CIERA

644
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:51,440
FLIPPED WE COULD BE IN BIG

645
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,150
TROUBLE HERE.

646
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,110
>> SO WE'RE GOING TYSON, RIGHT?

647
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:55,569
>> WE ARE, THAT'S --

648
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,404
>> THAT'S THE PLAN.

649
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,282
>> YEAH.

650
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,534
BUT WHEN THEY LEFT THEY WERE

651
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,952
KIND OF LOOKING OUT OUR

652
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:04,202
DIRECTION.

653
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,412
>> IT MAKES ME NERVOUS.

654
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,413
>> YEAH, ME, TOO.

655
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:09,041
>> WHY IS SHE SO CHUMMY WITH

656
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:09,249
TYSON?

657
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,667
>> I DON'T KNOW.

658
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,418
>> DO YOU THINK SHE WOULD GO

659
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,920
WITH TYSON?

660
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:13,420
>> I THINK POTENTIALLY.

661
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:17,633
>> BECAUSE IF SO THEN ONE OF YOU

662
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,259
COULD BLIND SIDE HER INTO GOING

663
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,678
-- IF WE DON'T HAVE HER VOTE.

664
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,180
I THOUGHT VOTING TYSON WAS THE

665
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:23,805
BEST OPTION AND IT WAS GOING TO

666
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,974
BE SMOOTH SAILING BUT NOW THAT

667
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,768
THERE'S SUSPICION ABOUT CIERA

668
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:28,393
THERE MAY HAVE TO BE A PLAN "B."

669
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,063
>> WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

670
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,522
WE'RE IN THE MAJORITY.

671
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,357
>> I FEEL LIKE AT THIS POINT

672
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,274
EVERYTHING'S ALL UP IN THE AIR

673
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,069
AND NO ONE IS SAFE SO THIS

674
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,737
CHALLENGE IS HUGE.

675
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,572
AND IF CIERA DOESN'T WIN

676
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,823
IMMUNITY SHE COULD BE IN

677
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:47,913
TROUBLE.

678
00:20:52,125 --> 00:21:02,427
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

679
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,470

685
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,525

IT'S ATTACHED TO A BUCKET.

690
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,535
INSIDE THE BUCKET IS 25% OF YOUR

691
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:26,827

00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:32,165
BE UNABLE TO BEAR THAT WEIGHT,

00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,209
THE ROPE WILL UNSPOOL, THE

LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS

698
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,050
IMMUNITY, IS SAFE FROM THE VOTE.

BUT THERE IS A TWIST.

704
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,478
IF, AFTER 29 DAYS, YOU FEEL SO

705
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,521

00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:13,975

ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY'S IN

START EATING.

756
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:23,485

757
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,070
>> THANK YOU.

758
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,613
>> Jeff: THERE IS 25% OF YOUR

759
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,448
BODY WEIGHT IN EACH BUCKET.

760
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,699
YOU'LL KNOW YOU'RE STARTING TO

761
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,575
GET IN TROUBLE WHEN YOUR BUCKET

762
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,451
STARTS TO LOWER.

763
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,913
THAT MEANS THAT ROPE IS

764
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:35,205
UNSPOOLING.

765
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,581
SEVEN PEOPLE CAME HERE TO

766
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,626

00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,254
LEAVING KATIE, HAYDEN, MONICA

768
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:45,340
AND CALEB TO DUKE IT OUT.

769
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:46,258
ALWAYS INTERESTING WHO WILL

770
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,843
CHOOSE TO NOT EVEN COMPETE FOR

771
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,636
THE ONE THING THAT KEEPS YOU

772
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,930
SAFE WITH SEVEN PEOPLE LEFT.

773
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:56,309

>> Jeff: KATIE'S BUCKET

775
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,271

HOW'S THE FOOD.

777

>> DELICIOUS TO THE TASTE AND

778
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,024
VERY DESIRABLE.

779
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:07,070
KEEP IT UP, GUYS.

780
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,865
>> Jeff: MONICA HAS WON TWO

781
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:10,615
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITIES.

782
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,700
SHE WOULD LOVE TO ADD THAT

783
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,034
NECKLACE ONCE AGAIN.

784
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,620
>> LISTEN, I'M HERE TO SHOW MY

785
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:15,829

786
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,747
THEIR DAD IS MADE OF GRIT BUT

787
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:18,123
SO'S THEIR MOM.

788
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,958
>> Jeff: THAT'S PART OF THIS

789
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,209
ADVENTURE FOR YOU, ISN'T IT?

790
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,419
>> WHOLEHEARTEDLY.

791
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,671
SHOW THE KIDS MORE THAN ONE BAD

792
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:25,714
ASS LIVES IN OUR HOUSE.

793
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:34,639

>> Jeff: BEEN OUT THERE TEN

795
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:38,226
MINUTES.

796
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,978
IT'S GOT TO SEEM LIKE AN HOUR.

797
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,438
>> IT HURTS.

798
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,565
>> YEAH, IT DOES.

799
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,609
>> (BELCHES).

800
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:46,943
>> Jeff: HAYDEN, DOES IT BUG

SO CONFIDENT THEY'RE GOING TO

00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:49,946
EAT?

804
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,572
>> IF I LOSE THIS CHALLENGE THEN

805
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:54,451
I'LL BE A LITTLE BIT UPSET.

806
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:58,038
>> AT US?

807
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,331
>> Jeff: MONICA'S BUCKET HAS

808
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:01,708
NOT MOVED AT ALL.

809
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,376
KATIE'S HAS DROPPED A BIT.

810
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,755
HAYDEN'S DROPPED A BIT.

811

>> GOOD JOB, GUYS.

816
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,438
>> I HOPE THEY GO FOR, LIKE, AN

817
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:23,605
HOUR.

818
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:24,105
>> SWEET TEA OR COKE?

819
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,649
>> ICED TEA.

820
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:26,733
I'LL DRINK ONE FOR YOU.

821
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:30,654

EVEN MORE.

827
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:50,298
KATIE CAN HOLD ON NO LONGER.

828
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,925
KATIE IS OUT OF THIS CHALLENGE

829
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:54,302
AND WE ARE DOWN TO THREE.

830
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:59,683
HAYDEN, MONICA AND CALEB.

831
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,726
CALEB, GET UNDER YOUR SKIN AT

832
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:01,893

833
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,187
THREE PEOPLE ARE SAYING "I KNOW

834
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:07,399
WE'RE NOT GOING HOME TONIGHT.

835
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,067
>> OH, YEAH, AT THIS POINT THE

836
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:09,734
WAY MY HANDS ARE HURTING.

837
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,736
BUT IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

838
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,281
>> THAT'S GOOD.

839
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,491
>> SKIN IS TEARING OFF THE

840
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:16,658

THEY'RE LAUGHING!

845
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,623
PERFORM MORE ME!

BRING ME SOME MORE MEAT!

848
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,211
>> JEFF, BLOOD WILL BE DRIPPING

849
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,462
INTERPRET THE I SOON.

850
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:37,846
>> AWESOME.

855
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:55,989
MONICA'S BUCKET IS STARTING TO

856
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:59,492
DROP A LITTLE.

857
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,245
HAYDEN SAYS "I'M HERE TO PLAY,

858
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,289
LET ME JUST REMIND YOU."

859
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,957
EVEN WITH THOSE BLISTERS HAYDEN

860
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,626
IS WRENCHING THAT BUCKET BACK

861
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:08,793
UP.

862
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:09,753
EVERYBODY PULLING THEIR BUCKETS

863
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:10,879

864
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,797
THAT IS DETERMINATION.

865
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,717
AND JUST LIKE THAT CALEB'S

866
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,052
SLIPPING AGAIN.

867
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,511
>> I'M STARTING TO BLEED.

868
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,721
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT

869
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,390
VOTING YOU OUT.

870
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,685
>> YUP.

871
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:26,811
>> SORRY GUYS.

872
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,813
>> GOOD JOB, CALEB.

873
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,191
>> CALEB, LET IT DOWN.

874
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:34,486
CANNOT TAKE THE PAIN ANYMORE.

875
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:35,695
DEFINITELY SHOWED HE IS WORTHY

876
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:42,619
BUT FELL SHORT.

00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:43,703
WE ARE DOWN TO TWO.

878
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,622
IT IS HAYDEN AND MONICA.

879
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:49,542
MONICA HAS WON TWO INDIVIDUAL

880
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:49,834
IMMUNITIES.

881
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:53,922
HAYDEN HAS WON NONE.

882
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:57,217
NO SOONER SAID THAN HE WRENCHES

883
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,802

GOING TO GET THIS WITHOUT

892
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,985
IT IS CRUNCH TIME FOR HAYDEN.

>> I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT STEAKS.

936
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,331
TELL ME ABOUT A CHICKEN.

937
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,790
>> THE STEAK WAS THE BEST.

938
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:53,500
>> WAS IT?

939
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,210
>> IT WAS SO SOFT.

940
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,212
LIKE, NO GRISTLE, NOTHING.

941
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,087
>> AND THE CHICKEN?

942
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,339
>> THE CHICKEN THERE WAS --

943
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:00,006
>> I LIKED THE SKIN ON THE

944
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:00,215
CHICKEN.

945
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:03,134
>> THERE WAS CHICKEN BREAST AND

946
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:03,426
DRUMSTICKS.

947
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,135
>> WHAT ABOUT THE BREAD?

948
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:04,761
THE BREAD?

949
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:05,220
WERE THE ROLLS GOOD?

950
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,430
>> THE LOAF WAS GOOD.

951
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,057
>> WE WALK INTO THE CHALLENGE

952
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,517
TODAY AND YOU CAN EITHER COMPETE

953
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,935
OR CHOOSE TO EAT AND I DON'T

954
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,937
WANT TO BE THE GUY THAT GETS

955
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,813
BLINDSIDED AND GOES HOME SO I

956
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,316
WANT TO COMPETE.

957
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,943
TYSON, GERVASE, CIERA, THEY ALL

958
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,861
CHOSE TO EAT AND IT'S KIND OF

959
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:22,320
TELLING.

960
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,404
THEY OBVIOUSLY FEEL VERY

961
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,030
COMFORTABLE AND IF THE THREE OF

962
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,282
THEM FEEL THAT GOOD MAYBE

963
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,909
THEY'RE ALL WORKING TOGETHER TO

964
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,744
GET RID OF ONE OF US.

965
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:31,412
>> WHEN I SAW THEM OVER THERE

966
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,623
TODAY EATING IT MADE ME WONDER.

967
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:35,583
>> I AGREE.

968
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,960
I DON'T THINK I CAN TRUST HER.

969
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,420
AND I KNOW I CAN TRUST CALEB AND

970
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,090
I KNOW I CAN TRUST YOU.

971
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,758
BUT IT'S THREE AGAINST FOUR.

972
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:44,050
>> RIGHT.

973
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,885
>> I'M IN A PREDICAMENT.

974
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,471
I COULD BE ON A SINKING SHIP SO

975
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,848
NOW I'M BACK-PEDALING THINKING

976
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:51,432
OKAY, I HAVE TO SCRAMBLE AND

977
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:59,649
MAKE A NEW PLAN.

978
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,568
>> I THINK CIERA'S ALREADY WENT

979
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:02,193
WITH TYSON.

980
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,278
WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE

981
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,863
HERE IN THE MAJORITY, DUDE, I

982
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,700
DON'T CARE HOW WE DO IT.

983
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:11,202
>> WHAT IF WE JUST FLAT OUT ASK

984
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:11,411
TYSON.

985
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:11,911
>> ASK HIM WHAT?

986
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:16,291
>> IF THEY'RE PLANNING ON BLIND

987
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,166
SIDING ONE OF US.

988
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,459
SEE WHAT HIS REACTION IS.

989
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,671
>> UH-HUH.

990
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,673
>> AND THEN WE CAN EVEN SAY

991
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:24,716
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY PLAYING US

992
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,258
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

993
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,927
>> YEAH.

994
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:34,976
>> AND WE ALL VOTE AS ONE.

995
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,271
>> I'M JUST NOT FEELING 100% ON

996
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:38,479
THEM.

997
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,022
>> I'M NOT, EITHER.

998
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:48,740
>> CIERA DID IT TO HERSELF.

999
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,450
>> HEY, WE'VE GOT TO BE ON THE

1000
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:50,700
SAME PAGE.

1001
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:51,200
>> RIGHT.

1002
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:54,912
>> LIKE, SERIOUSLY.

1003
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:59,083
UM, WE FELT LIKE YOU, CIERA AND

1004
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,545
GERVASE ARE TRYING TO GET ONE OF

1005
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:02,795
US.

1006
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:03,296
>> RIGHT.

1007
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:03,671
>> Jeff: .

1008
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,130
>> THAT'S WHAT I FEEL.

1009
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:07,342
>> I WAS KIND OF UNDER THE SAME

1010
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,259
IMPRESSION THAT YOU GUYS WERE

1011
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,135
OUT TO GET ME.

1012
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,137
CIERA BLAMED THAT ON YOU GUYS.

1013
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,432
>> THE ONLY REASON IS BECAUSE WE

1014
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,016
THOUGHT YOU WERE TRYING TO GET

1015
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,017
US.

1016
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,061
IN MY HEAD I'M THINKING IF

1017
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,145
TYSON'S AFTER ME WE HAVE TO GET

1018
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:19,687
HIM FIRST.

1019
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,063
>> RIGHT.

1020
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,315
>> NOW I DON'T WANT THAT.

1021
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:25,151
>> CIERA'S BEEN PULL MEGAASIDE

1022
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:25,985
LIKE "WE GOT TO TALK."

1023
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,071
I'M LIKE THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

1024
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:28,655
WHY YOU GUYS WOULD DO THAT.

1025
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:29,238
I'M LIKE WE'VE GOT IN THE THE

1026
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,324
BAG, WHY ARE THEY (BLEEP)ING IT

1027
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:31,616
UP?

1028
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,910
SO I WAS STILL SKEPTICAL OF IT

1029
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:34,077
ALL.

1030
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,370
HAYDEN AND CALEB PULLED ME ASIDE

1031
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,204
AND WERE LIKE "CIERA'S PLAYING

1032
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,080
BOTH SIDES."

1033
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,332
WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT IT MAKES

1034
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,500
SENSE, WHY WOULDN'T SHE?

1035
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,959
SHE SEEMS LIKE A SMART ENOUGH

1036
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,002
GIRL AND I KNOW SHE'S A GOOD

1037
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:43,211
LIAR.

1038
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,505
IN HER MIND SHE'S PROBABLY

1039
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:46,130
THINKING BY PITTING THE GUYS

1040
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,174
AGAINST EACH OTHER SHE CAN STICK

1041
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,842
AROUND A LITTLE LONGER AND THAT

1042
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,428
WAS A SMART MOVE ON HER PART.

1043
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,055
BUT NOW I'M FEELING LIKE SHE'S

1044
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:57,016
TOO SNEAKY AND TOO SMART AND TOO

1045
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,810
DECEIVING TO BE IN THE GAME

1046
00:32:58,893 --> 00:32:59,060
ANYMORE.

1047
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,269
>> IT'S GOT TO BE CIERA.

1048
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,104
>> PROMISE ME I WON'T HAVE THE

1049
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:02,855
MAJORITY ON MY NAME.

1050
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:03,439
>> YOU WON'T.

1051
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,066
>> OKAY, LET'S DO IT.

1052
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:05,900
CIERA GUARANTEED.

1053
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:07,068
>> OKAY.

1054
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,361
WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE.

1055
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:09,070
>> THE PROBLEM IS I DON'T TRUST

1056
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,114
HAYDEN AND CALEB, EITHER.

1057
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,448
WHO KNOWS?

1058
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,950
THEY COULD BE TRYING TO MAKE ME

1059
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,869
FEEL COMFORTABLE AND THEN POW I

1060
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:21,290
GET HIT WITH A HEART BREAKER.

1061
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:24,168
SO I MIGHT HAVE TO PLAY MY

1062
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,253
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

1063
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,088
IT'S THAT LITTLE ADDED BIT OF

1064
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,339
INSURANCE IN CASE SOMETHING

1065
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,174
SCREWY HAPPENS.

1066
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,176
>> I BELIEVED HIM.

1067
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,469
>> I DO, DO YOU?

1068
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,347
>> YEAH, I FELT LIKE HE -- HE

1069
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,267
WASN'T EXACTLY SCRAMBLING.

1070
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,601
TYSON'S TELLING US HE'S STILL

1071
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,562
WITH US BUT I'M NOT SURE I BUY

1072
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:42,770
IT 100%.

1073
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,063
HAYDEN FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE

1074
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,732
WITH IT THAN I DO.

1075
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,150
I'M CITY THINKING IS HE STILL

1076
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:47,734
PLAYING US?

1077
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:48,735
IS HE PLANNING SOMETHING?

1078
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:49,444
IS HE NOT.

1079
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,320
>> SHE HAS NO IDEA.

1080
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,697
SHE'S BEEN LAYING AROUND

1081
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:52,947
SLEEPING.

1082
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,198
>> IT'S WAKE UP TIME.

1083
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,074
WAKE UP.

1084
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,492
>> WAKE UP TIME.

1085
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,828
>> I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY THE GAME OF

1086
00:33:58,911 --> 00:33:59,454
"SURVIVOR" ANYTHING CAN GO WRONG

1087
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,122
BUT HOPEFULLY EVERYBODY'S ON

1088
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:04,459
BOARD AND CIERA'S GOING HOME

1089
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:04,667
TONIGHT.

1090
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:05,835
SHE SHOULD HAVE PICKED A SIDE

1091
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:14,218
AND STUCK WITH IT.

1092
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,262
>> THE BOYS JUST APPROACHED ME

1093
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,681
AND SAID THEY'VE BEEN GETTING

1094
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:19,807
SKETCHED OUT BECAUSE THEY'VE

1095
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:20,391
BEEN GETTING A WEIRD VIBE FROM

1096
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,143
US SO THEN THEY THOUGHT THEY

1097
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,020
WERE GETTING BLINDSIDED SO THEY

1098
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:24,979
STARTED GUNNING FOR US.

1099
00:34:25,062 --> 00:34:26,189
THEY CAME TO ME WITH THIS INFO.

1100
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:26,981
>> UH-HUH.

1101
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,441
>> HERE'S THE THING, WHO DO WE

1102
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,150
VOTE OUT?

1103
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,360
CIERA OR CALEB?

1104
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,195
BECAUSE IT SOUNDED PRETTY

1105
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,447
PLAUSIBLE WHAT THEY SAID.

1106
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,740
TEENAGE MOM?

1107
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,533
HELL RAISER?

1108
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,035
SHE CAN LOOK IN YOUR EYES AND

1109
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:39,786
LIE BETTER THAN ANYBODY.

1110
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,746
>> OH, YEAH, OH, YEAH.

1111
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:42,288
I AGREE.

1112
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,790
ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYTHING IS

1113
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,626
BLOWN TO PIECES.

1114
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:47,168
SOMEBODY'S LYING IN THIS.

1115
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:50,087
EITHER HAYDEN AND CALEB OR

1116
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:50,296
CIERA.

1117
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:50,880
>> THEY TOLD ME HOW THEY WERE

1118
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,465
GOING TO VOTE, THEY HADN'T COME

1119
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:53,341
TO ME WHICH EITHER MEANS THEY'RE

1120
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,760
TRYING TO DRAW VOTES OFF OF THEM

1121
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,513
BY THROWING THEM ON CIERA OR

1122
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,182
TELLING THE TRUTH.

1123
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,434
YOU TELL ME.

1124
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:04,977
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!

1125
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,437
I DON'T KNOW WHO TO TRUST!

1126
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,146
AT THESE TIMES IT JUST COMES

1127
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,273
DOWN TO YOUR GUT AND THAT'S

1128
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:09,482
SCARY.

1129
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,609
BECAUSE YOU PUT YOUR TRUST IN

1130
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,070
THE WRONG PERSON, YOU'RE GOING

1131
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:17,365
HOME!

1132
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,546
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

1133
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:34,423
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1134
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:40,763
ARAS AND HIS BROTHER VYTAS.

1135
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,223
ALL RIGHT, SO LET'S TALK ABOUT

1136
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,307
TODAY'S CHALLENGE.

1137
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,225
HAYDEN, WHEN YOU HAVE THE

1138
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,351
OPPORTUNITY TO SIT OUT SO YOU

1139
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,353
CAN EAT AND THREE PEOPLE TAKE IT

1140
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,188
AND FOUR DON'T, IT SHOWS THAT

1141
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,606
THERE IS NOT HARMONY.

1142
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,401
>> RIGHT.

1143
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:53,651
NO DOUBT.

1144
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:54,235
AND IT TELLS YOU WHO FEELS

1145
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,279
COMFORTABLE AND WHO DOESN'T FEEL

1146
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,196
COMFORTABLE RIGHT AWAY.

1147
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,906
I MEAN, I CAN SHOW YOU MY HANDS.

1148
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,074
>> Jeff: HOLD THOSE HANDS UP

1149
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:00,533
FOR ME.

1150
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:00,950
I WANT TO SEE THEM.

1151
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,910
>> THEY DON'T EVEN LOOK AS BAD

1152
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,537
AS THEY DID BECAUSE THE BLISTERS

1153
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,204
HAVE FOLDED BACK.

1154
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,081
THEY WERE BORDERLINE BLEEDING.

1155
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:08,291
>> Jeff: SO HAYDEN, WHEN YOU

1156
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,917
COME BACK TO CAMP WITH HANDS

1157
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:10,501
THAT TOMORROW ARE GOING TO BE

1158
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,713
WORSE AND TYSON AND GERVASE AND

1159
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,923
CIERA ALL COME BACK BELLY FULL

1160
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,925
OF FOOD AND IT'S NOT RICE.

1161
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,094
>> THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF

1162
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:20,344
JEALOUSY.

1163
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,220
REALLY JUST BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL

1164
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,889
AS COMFORTABLE AS THEY DO.

1165
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,891
IT'S LIKE, MAN, HOW DO THEY FEEL

1166
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:25,683
SO GOOD THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO SIT

1167
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:26,350
OUT THIS CHALLENGE WHERE I'M ON

1168
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,936
THE OTHER SIDE THINKING, MAN,

1169
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,354
I'VE GOT TO WIN TODAY OR I COULD

1170
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:30,688
BE GOING HOME.

1171
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,398
>> Jeff: CALEB, WAS THERE ANY

1172
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:33,900
OF THE THREE THAT SAT OUT THAT

1173
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:34,400
SURPRISED YOU?

1174
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:35,651
>> NOT REALLY.

1175
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:35,818
NO.

1176
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:36,777
>> Jeff: SO YOU WEREN'T

1177
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,404
SHOCKED TO SEE CIERA SIT OUT?

1178
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,781
>> NO, I MEAN SHE PROBABLY FEELS

1179
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:41,365
COMFORTABLE AND SHE LIKES TO

1180
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:41,532
EAT.

1181
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,993
>> SHE PROBABLY FEELS

1182
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:44,285
COMFORTABLE?

1183
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,745
THERE'S NOWHERE TO HIDE!

1184
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,580
THERE'S SEVEN PEOPLE LEFT.

1185
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,540
CIERA, IT'S A GIGANTIC MOVE.

1186
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,334
IT'S ONE THING THERE F THERE'S

1187
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,210
11 OR 12 PEOPLE.

1188
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,419
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY IF I

1189
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:54,587
LOOK AT THE CHALLENGE AND I

1190
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,796
DON'T THINK I CAN WIN I'M GOING

1191
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,297
TO EAT.

1192
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,965
BECAUSE I'D RATHER NOT PLAY AND

1193
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,219
EAT THAN LOSE AND NOT EAT.

1194
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:01,719
>> Jeff: TYSON, WERE YOU

1195
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:04,555
SURPRISED THAT YOU, GERVASE AND

1196
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,973
CIERA WERE THE THREE THAT SAT

1197
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:06,140
OUT?

1198
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:06,724
>> I WAS SURPRISED THAT MORE

1199
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,142
PEOPLE WEREN'T EATING.

1200
00:37:08,225 --> 00:37:09,685
I MEAN, I FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH

1201
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,063
THE ALLIANCES I'VE MADE AND I

1202
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,147
WOULD HOPE WOULD FEEL

1203
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:13,689
COMFORTABLE WITH ME SO EVEN

1204
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:16,400
THOUGH ALL OF MY ALLIANCE WASN'T

1205
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,443
THERE I TRIED TO ENJOY THE FOOD

1206
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,153
AS BEST I COULD.

1207
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:22,865
WHICH WAS A LOT.

1208
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,742
>> Jeff: LET'S TALK ABOUT

1209
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:24,951
TRUST.

1210
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,827
GERVASE, SUCH A SIMPLE LITTLE

1211
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:27,745
WORD, ISN'T IT?

1212
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,498
>> I TRUST PEOPLE IN MY

1213
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,875
ALLIANCE.

1214
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:33,334
I HAVE TO.

1215
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,002
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

1216
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,545
SO I'M HOPING THEY KEEP THEIR

1217
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:36,754
WORD.

1218
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:37,380
I MEAN, WITH THE TRUST AND BONDS

1219
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,382
THAT I'VE MADE WITH THE PEOPLE

1220
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,800
IN MY ALLIANCE --

1221
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:41,342
>> Jeff: HAYDEN, HE LOOKED

1222
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,843
RIGHT AT YOU.

1223
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,303
HE SAID "I TRUST THE PEOPLE IN

1224
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,388
MY ALLIANCE AND I'M HOPING THEY

1225
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,472
KEEP THEIR WORD."

1226
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,933
>> WELL I THINK GERVASE REALIZE

1227
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,434
THERE IS' BEEN TIMES THAT, YEAH,

1228
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,645
I'VE BEEN PARANOID BUT I THINK

1229
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,313
WE TRUST ONE ANOTHER.

1230
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,523
>> Jeff: SO CIERA, THAT CAN'T

1231
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,817
FEEL GREAT, TWO GUYS BEHIND YOU

1232
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,610
LOOKING AT EACH OTHER GOING

1233
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,070
"WELL, WE'RE GOOD."

1234
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,697
I DON'T SEE ANYBODY TAPPING YOUR

1235
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:02,989
SHOULDER?

1236
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,240
>> IT FEELS LIKE CRAP.

1237
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,491
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PART OF AN

1238
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:06,367
ALLIANCE AND TO HEAR GERVASE AND

1239
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,369
HAYDEN ARE CLOSE SECONDS BEFORE

1240
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,037
WE'RE ABOUT TO VOTE I FEEL LIKE

1241
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,497
THERE'S AN UNDERCOVER MESSAGE OR

1242
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,581
WHO KNOWS WHAT?

1243
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,291
>> Jeff: TYSON, FOR TONIGHT'S

1244
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:14,875
VOTE, WOULD YOU BE SHOCKED IF

1245
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:15,459
YOU WERE VOTED OUT?

1246
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,254
>> I COME INTO TRIBAL COUNCIL

1247
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,714
HOPING FOR THE BEST BUT

1248
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,465
EXPECTING THE WORST SO, YEAH,

1249
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:22,508
I'D BE SHOCKED.

1250
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,343
BUT THAT'S "SURVIVOR."

1251
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,929
SOMEBODY GETS BLINDSIDED AND

1252
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,014
SOMEBODY GETS SHOCKED AND IT

1253
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,765
HAPPENS ALMOST EVERY TRIBAL

1254
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:30,016
COUNCIL.

1255
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,100
>> Jeff: CALEB, HOW ABOUT YOU?

1256
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,560
DO YOU THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE

1257
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:33,060
A BLIND SIDE TONIGHT?

1258
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,353
>> YES, I DO.

1259
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,355
>> Jeff: CIERA, WOULD YOU BE

1260
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,440
SHOCKED TONIGHT IF IT WAS YOU.

1261
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,817
>> I WOULD TOTALLY -- I WOULD BE

1262
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,068
COMPLETELY SHOCKED BECAUSE I

1263
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,694
FEEL LIKE AS FAR AS MY ALLIANCE

1264
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:45,406
GOES I'VE BEEN 100% HONEST,

1265
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,324
PROBABLY OVERLY HONEST SHARING

1266
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,534
INFORMATION AND I PUT MY TRUST

1267
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,660
IN THEM 100%.

1268
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:50,411
SO IF IT IS ME TONIGHT THEN IT

1269
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:54,749
WOULD BE A HUGE BLIND SIDE AND

1270
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,042
THE PARANOIA OF THAT IS ALWAYS

1271
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,961
THERE AND IT'S HIGHER THAN EVER.

1272
00:38:59,045 --> 00:38:59,587
>> Jeff: OKAY.

1273
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,547
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1274
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:05,217
KATIE, YOU'RE UP.

1275
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,653
>> YOU JUST RAN YOUR MOUTH WAY

1276
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:28,699
TOO MUCH IN THE PAST TWO DAYS.

1277
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,503
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1278
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:45,382
VOTES.

1279
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,550
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1280
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,552
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

1281
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:53,432
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1282
00:39:53,516 --> 00:40:06,278
>> JEFF?

1283
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,239
JEFF, IT'S IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

1284
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:09,490
THAT'S NOT IT.

1285
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,159
HOLD THAT FOR A SECOND.

1286
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,452
>> SERIOUSLY, DUDE?

1287
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:14,537
>> COME ON, I GOT A LOT OF STUFF

1288
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:19,166
IN HERE.

1289
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,167
THERE IT IS.

1290
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:33,722
>> OH, MY GOSH!

1291
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:34,598
>> Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN

1292
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,475
IMMUNITY IDOL.

1293
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,644
ANY VOTES CAST FOR TYSON WILL

1294
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:39,937
NOT COUNT.

1295
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,899
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1296
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:48,529
FIRST VOTE, SEE CIERA.

1297
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,615
CALEB.

1298
