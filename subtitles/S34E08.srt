1
00:00:01,876 --> 00:00:06,881
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," ZEKE STARTED A

2
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:07,799
REVOLT AGAINST ANDREA.

3
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:11,219
>> I'M INTERESTED IN SEEING
ANDREA GO HOME.

4
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:12,971
>> Jeff: BUT ANDREA FOUGHT
BACK.

5
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:16,307
>> HOW DID HE THINK THIS WAS
GOING THE TURN OUT WELL FOR HIM?

6
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,309
I AM FURIOUS.

7
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:21,312
>> Jeff: AMID THE CHAOS,
DEBBIE SAW HER OPPORTUNITY TO

8
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,274
STRIKE, AND SARAH WAS LEFT IN
THE MID-LE WITH MAJOR DECISION.

9
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,316
>> THEY'RE VOTING FOR OZZY.

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,652
>> WE HAVE TO VET OUT ZEKE.

11
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:32,240
>> IT'S A REAL TOUGH POSITION TO
BE IN.

12
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:35,952
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL
DEBBIE GOT HER WAY.

13
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:38,288
OZZY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

14
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:44,919
>> GOOD
>> Jeff: 11 ARE LEFT.

15
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:49,007
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

16
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,312
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT, GUYS,
KINDLING?

17
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:06,107
GET A POT OF TEA GOING?

18
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,317
WHAT I WANTED TO
HAPPEN HAPPENED.

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,194
WE HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OF THIS
GAME.

20
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,363
THERE IS A LINE DRAWN IN
CONCRETE.

21
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:20,288
NOW THAT WE HAVE SARAH, MYSELF,
SIERRA, TROYZAN, BRAD AND TAI,

22
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:24,334
WE ARE A SIX THAT ARE NOT GOING
TO BE BLOWN AWAY BY THE WIND OR

23
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,335
THE TIDE.

24
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:29,672
AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO PICK OFF
FIVE THAT ARE LEFT

25
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,343
SYSTEMATICALLY ONE BY ONE.

26
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,220
>> TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS A SHOCKER.

27
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:38,139
I WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF THE
LOOP.

28
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,183
I THOUGHT WE WERE TRYING TO GET
OUT ZEKE.

29
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,559
SO I GUESS I'M SCREWED.

30
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,812
I'M IN THE MINORITY.

31
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,022
ZEKE, DO YOU WANT THE TALK ABOUT
WHY I VOTED FOR YOU?

32
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,190
>> NO, THAT'S FINE.

33
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:47,649
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WHY.

34
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:48,858
>> I WANT TO HEAR?

35
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,361
>> I DON'T THINK YOU EVER HAD
ANY INTENTION OF TAKING ME VERY

36
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,239
DEEP IN THIS GAME, AND NEITHER
DID CIRIE.

37
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,574
>> OKAY.

38
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,408
ALL RIGHT.

39
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:01,496
>> YOU'RE WELCOME TO CONTINUE
TALKING.

40
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,580
>> GOOD LUCK.

41
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:03,832
>> CLEARLY SOME PEOPLE TRUST ME.

42
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:10,880
>> NO, I MEAN, THEY TRUST YOU
FOR A COUPLE VOTES, BUT EVERYONE

43
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:11,798
HERE...

44
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,383
>> THIS CONVERSATION DOESN'T
SEEM PRODUCTIVE.

45
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,051
SO I'M GOING THE TALK TO OTHER
PEOPLE.

46
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:18,054
>> OBVIOUSLY I WAS NOT INCLUDED
IN THE MAJORITY VOTE, BUT SINCE

47
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:22,100
I KNOW ANDREA IS COMING AFTER
ME, I NEED PROTECTION.

48
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:26,104
SO I FEEL LIKE I DON'T HAVE ANY
CHOICE BUT TO STAY WITH THE

49
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:30,358
MAJORITY ALLIANCE.

50
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:34,445
>> WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW?

51
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,364
ANDREA SAYING WHAT SHE SAID, HER
TRUE COLORS ARE SHOWN.

52
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,575
SHE TELLS YOU, GOOD LUCK.

53
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,951
YOU'RE WITH US.

54
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:43,246
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TALK TO
THEM.

55
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:47,584
>> AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, I HAD TO
PICK A SIDE, BUT I STILL WANT TO

56
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,459
WORK WITH ZEKE.

57
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:53,047
HAVING ZEKE OPENS UP OPTIONS FOR
ME.

58
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,632
I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO BE
OKAY.

59
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,552
I JUST COULDN'T FILL YOU IN ON
EVERYTHING, BECAUSE I NEED THEM

60
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,303
TO TRUST ME.

61
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,471
SO I'M SORRY I LEFT YOU OUT OF
IT.

62
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,431
>> IT'S OKAY.

63
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,599
I UNDERSTAND.

64
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,977
>> AS MUCH AS PEOPLE WANT TO
THINK THE LINE IS DRAWN IN THE

65
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,397
SAND, WELL, I HATE THE BREAK IT
TO PEOPLE, BUT THE TIDE COMES UP

66
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,273
PRETTY QUICKLY.

67
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:15,028
AND THAT LINE GETS WASHED AWAY.

68
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:18,865
(<i> THEME SONG PLAYING</i> )

69
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:37,800
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

70
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:38,134
YOU GUYS READY THE GET TO
TODAY'S REWARD CHALLENGE?

71
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,802
>> YES.

72
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,429
>> Jeff: FOR TODAY'S
CHALLENGE, WE'LL BE DIVIDED INTO

73
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,639
TWO TEAMS OF FIVE.

74
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:46,476
ON MY GO, ONE PERSON AT A TIME
WILL RACE THROUGH A SERIES OF

75
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,977
OBSTACLES TO THE PLATFORM.

76
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,979
AND THE NEXT PERSON GOES.

77
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,441
ONCE ALL FIVE ARE AT THE END,
WITH FIVE DOWN, GRAB A GRAPPLING

78
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:58,488
HOOK AND USE IT TO RETRIEVE FIVE
RINGS FLOATING IN THE WATER.

79
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,699
FIRST TEAM TO FINISH WINS
REWARD.

80
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:02,367
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?

81
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,576
>> YEAH.

82
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:10,375
>> Jeff: THE WINNING TEAM WILL
BE TAKEN BY SEA PLANE TO TRULY

83
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:14,003
ONE OF THE MOST STUNNING ISLAND
CHAINS IN ALL OF FIJI.

84
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,715
YOU'LL ENJOY A PICNIC WITH
ENOUGH VARIETY FOR EVERYBODY.

85
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,469
WE'RE GOING TO DO A SCHOOLYARD
PICK, WHICH MEANS ONE PERSON

86
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,971
WILL NOT PARTICIPATE.

87
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:27,350
ONE PERSON WILL HAVE NO SHOT AT
THIS REWARD.

88
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,227
WE'RE GOING THE DRAW FOR
CAPTAINS.

89
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,520
WE'LL GET STARTED.

90
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:37,652
>> OH, BOY.

91
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:38,194
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

92
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:40,613
WE HAVE OUR TWO TEAMS.

00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:44,534
CULPEPPER WAS CAPTAIN, CHOSE
DEBBIE, SIERRA, ANDREA AND

94
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,743
AUBRY.

95
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:51,165
CIRIE WAS A CAPTAIN, SHE CHOSE
ZEKE, SARAH, TROYZAN AND TAI.

96
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,875
MICHAELA WAS NOT PICKED.

97
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,168
MICHAELA, TAKE A SPOT ON THE
BENCH.

98
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:57,547
HOW YOU FEELING?

99
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,883
LIKE THEY SHOULD HAVE PICKED ME.

100
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,719
>> Jeff: ARE THEY MISSING OUT
ON YOU?

101
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,889
>> YEAH, PEOPLE PICKING ALLIANCE
MEMBERS TO PLAY WITH INSTEAD OF

102
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:07,724
PLAYING TO WIN.

103
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,934
I DON'T GIVE A [BLEEPED] WHAT
HAPPENS.

104
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,227
I'M JUST WATCHING.

105
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,395
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

106
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,606
HERE WE GO, FOR THE BIGGEST
REWARD OF THE SEASON, SURVIVORS

107
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,358
READY?

108
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,902
>> DON'T MAKE NO DAMN SENSE.

109
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,863
>> Jeff: GO!

110
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,741
IT IS CULPEPPER AND TAI.

111
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,993
GOT TO GET UP THAT LADDER AND
DOWN THE SLIDE.

112
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,078
>> GOT IT, BRAD.

113
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,414
>> Jeff: CULPEPPER IS OVER.

114
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,542
TAI IS OVER.

115
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,211
CULPEPPER HITS THE SECOND
OBSTACLE.

116
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,254
TAI RIGHT BEHIND.

117
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,256
>> YOU GOT IT, TAI.

118
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:44,093
>> Jeff: 25 DAYS OUT HERE, AS
ALWAYS THEY TAKE A TOLL.

119
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,428
>> GO!

120
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:50,767
>> Jeff: MICHAELA FRUSTRATED
THAT SHE WAS NOT CHOSEN AGAIN.

121
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,936
TRICKIEST PART, THE BALANCE
BEAM.

122
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,647
CULPEPPER IS ACROSS ON HIS FIRST
TRY.

123
00:05:56,731 --> 00:06:00,651
TAI REACHES THE BEAM, HAVING
TROUBLE EVEN GETTING UP ON THE

124
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,736
PLATFORM.

125
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,614
ONCE YOU'RE BACK TO THE MAT, THE
NEXT PERSON CAN GO.

126
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,616
GO, BLUE!

127
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,117
SIERRA IN THE WATER NOW.

128
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:12,121
TAI IS NOW GOING THE CRAWL
ACROSS THE BEAM, WHICH TAKES A

129
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,124
LOT OF TIME.

130
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,336
SIERRA HARD DOWN THE SLIDE.

131
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:24,550
BLUE STARTING TO OPEN UP A LEAD
NOW.

132
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,635
TAI'S ACROSS.

133
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,637
STILL GOT TO GET TO THE FINISH
PLATFORM.

134
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,473
SIERRA IS GOING TO BE CLOSE TO
CATCHING TAI.

135
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:30,807
>> YOU GOT IT.

136
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,308
YOU GOT IT.

137
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,309
YOU GOT IT.

138
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:36,521
>> Jeff: AN SHE IS QUICKLY
ACROSS ON HER FIRST TRY.

139
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:36,896
HERE COMES TAI.

140
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,316
GO, ORANGE!

141
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,150
NOW TROYZAN IN THE WATER.

142
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,528
>> GOOD JOB, TROY.

143
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,614
>> Jeff: TROYZAN UP AND OVER
AND LOSES HIS SHORTS.

144
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:49,659
SIERRA, YOU GOT TO GET ON THAT
MAT.

145
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,660
GO, BLUE!

146
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,703
IT'S AUBRY IN THE WATER.

147
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,162
HERE COMES TROYZAN.

148
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,372

>> Jeff: TRYING TO MAKE UP
SOME TIME.

150
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,999

00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,669
>> Jeff: AUBRY GOES OVER
AWKWARDLY.

152
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,713
TROYZAN BARELY KEEPS THOSE
SHORTS UP.

153
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:06,634
25 DAYS AND VERY LITTLE FOOD
SHOWING.

154
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:10,138
TROYZAN'S ACROSS.

155
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,639
TROYZAN PICKING UP THE PACE.

156
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,558
BLUE STILL WITH A BIG LEAD.

157
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,060
>> GIVE ME HAND.

158
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,353
>> Jeff: GO, ORANGE!

159
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:19,689
IT'S NOW SARAH IN THE WATER FOR
ORANGE.

160
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:20,565
HERE GOES AUBRY.

161
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:24,402
HER FIRST SHOT AT THE BEAM.

162
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,653
>> LET'S GO, GIRL!

163
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,197
>> Jeff: AUBRY CAN'T THIS IT.

164
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:28,656
SHE FALLS.

165
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:29,699
GOT TO GO BACK.

166
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,325
THAT WILL OPEN THE DOOR FOR
ORANGE.

167
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,368
HERE COMES SARAH.

168
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,787
CAN SHE CLOSE UP SOME OF THIS
GAP?

169
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,706
AUBRY STILL STRUGGLING.

170
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,709
SARAH CAN TAKE THE LEAD FOR
ORANGE HERE.

171
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,544
>> YOU GOT IT, AUBRY.

172
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,713
TACK YOUR TIME, GIRL.

173
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:48,509
>> Jeff: SARAH PUTS ORANGE IN
THE LEAD.

174
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,594
>> RUN, RUN, RUN, RUN, RUN!

175
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,305
>> Jeff: AUBRY'S ACROSS.

176
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,390
GO, ORANGE!

177
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:55,766
>> SIT ON THE MAT.

178
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,476
NO GO, BLUE!

179
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,229
WE ARE NECK AND NECK.

180
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,105
DEBBIE GOES OVER.

181
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,231
>> COME ON, ZEKE.

182
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,858
>> Jeff: ZEKE REACHES THE
SECOND OBSTACLE.

183
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,067
>> NICE, ZEKE.

184
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,611
>> Jeff: DEBBIE RIGHT ON HIS
TAIL.

185
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,780
HUGE REWARD ON THE LINE.

186
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,909
THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF THE
CHALLENGE NOW.

187
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,244
DEBBIE IS GOING THE CRAWL.

188
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,580
SCEEK'S GOING TO CRAWL, TOO.

189
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,042
DEBBIE'S ACROSS.

190
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,961
ZEKE CAN'T MAKE IT.

191
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,714
GO, BLUE!

192
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,216
>> YOU CAN DO THIS.

193
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:33,804
>> Jeff: ZEKE FEELING THE
PRESSURE NOW ZEKE GOES BACK IN.

194
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:34,764
ANDREA NOW CATCHING ZEKE.

195
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,808
>> GOOD JOB, ANDREA!

196
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,686
>> Jeff: ZEKE GOING TO GIVE IT
ANOTHER GO.

197
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,646
ANDREA HEADING TO THE BALANCE
BEAM NOW.

198
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,440
CAN SHE LAP ZEKE IN ANDREA
CALLING.

199
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,149
>> YOU GOT IT.

200
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,778
>> Jeff: ZEKE NOT GIVING UP.

201
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,823
AN DEGREE YES'S ACROSS.

202
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,993
ZEKE CLOSER.

203
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,245
GO, BLUE!

204
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:03,334
IT IS CULPEPPER NOW WITH THE
MATT.

205
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:06,796
CULPEPPER DIVES DOWN TO RETRIEVE
THE GRAPPLING HOOK.

206
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,130
ZEKE'S FINALLY ACROSS.

207
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,424
ORANGE IS BACK IN IT.

208
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,926
GO, CIRIE.

209
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:15,846
IT'S NOW CIRIE IN THE WATER WITH
A BELLY FLOP.

210
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,432
CULPEPPER HAS THE GRAPPLING
HOOK.

211
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,310
BLUE CAN START TRYING TO
RETRIEVE THEIR RINGS.

212
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,479
SIERRA WITH A TOSS.

213
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:25,856
WON'T DO.

214
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,483
>> COME ON, CIRIE.

215
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,611
>> Jeff: CIRIE IS DOWN THE
SLIDE NOW, MOVING SLOWLY IN THE

216
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:34,657
WATER.

217
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,996
SIERRA HOOKS THE FIRST RING FOR
BLUE.

218
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,540
CIRIE REACHES THAT SECOND
OBSTACLE, AND SHE'S CLEARLY

219
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:42,999
EXHAUSTED.

220
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,000
>> COME ON, CIRIE.

221
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,502
>> CIRIE, YOU CAN DO IT!

222
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,838
>> Jeff: SIERRA SNAGS A SECOND
RING FOR BLUE.

223
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,673
>> CIRIE, EVERYTHING YOU GOT.

224
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:51,841
>> I CAN'T GIVE UP.

225
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,175
>> Jeff: CIRIE NOT GIVING UP.

226
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,136
THERE IS NOWHERE TO HIDE.

227
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,847
"SURVIVOR" EXPOSES YOUR
STRENGTHS AND YOUR WEAKNESSES

228
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:04,854
AND CAN MAKE YOU FEEL VERY
VULNERABLE.

229
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:08,065
SIERRA SNAGS A THIRD RING FOR
BLUE.

230
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:14,030
>> NICE JOB.

231
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,699
>> Jeff: SIERRA GOING TO SWIM
OUT TO HELP CIRIE, WHICH MEANS

232
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:27,209
SHE WILL HAVE TO RUN THESE TWO
PARTS OF THE COURSE AGAIN.

233
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:32,631
SIERRA PUSHING CIRIE UP.

234
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,885
SIERRA CAN NOW FOLLOW BEHIND
HER.

235
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,845
>> YOU GOT IT, CIRIE.

236
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:43,100
>> Jeff: UNBELIEVABLE THAT
MICHAELA IS ENCOURAGING CIRIE

237
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,519
GIVEN SHE WASN'T CHOSEN.

238
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,730
>> I CAN DO THIS.

239
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,564
>> Jeff: .

240
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:49,899
>> Sarah: NOT GIVING UP ON HER
TEAMMATE.

241
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:53,569
CIRIE GOING TO GIVE THE BEAM A
SHOT NOW, EXHAUSTED, WHICH WILL

242
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:57,740
MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT.

243
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,533
>> I'M SORRY.

244
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,411
>> Jeff: BLUE VERY CLOSE TO
WINNING THIS.

245
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:06,582
CULPEPPER SNAGS THE FIFTH RING
FOR BLUE.

246
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:10,086
BLUE WINS REWARD.

247
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:18,427
CULPEPPER, SIERRA, DEBBIE, AN
DEGREE -- ANDREA AND AUBRY.

248
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,055
CIRIE, YOU ARE THE WOMAN WHO
OVER A DECADE AGO GOT UP OFF THE

249
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,724
COUCH TO COME TRY THIS GAME
"SURVIVOR."

250
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,768
THESE ARE THE MOMENTS YOU WERE
LOOKING FOR.

251
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:29,271
THIS CHALLENGE IS OVER, BUT WE
WILL STAY HERE WITH YOU IF YOU

252
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:33,776
WANT THE TRY TO CONQUER THIS.

253
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,569
>> YOU CAN DO IT, CIRIE.

254
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,781
>> COME ON, GIRL.

255
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:45,746
>> Jeff: EVERYBODY SUPPORTING
YOU, CIRIE.

256
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,163
[CRYING]
>> LOOK AT ME.

257
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,290
KEEP BREATHING.

258
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,167
>> Jeff: YOU'RE GOING TO GET
THIS, CIRIE.

259
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:50,751
>> OKAY.

260
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,420
>> YOU CAN DO IT, CIRIE.

261
00:11:52,503 --> 00:12:03,514
>> I GOT IT.

262
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,599
>> THERE YOU GO, GIRL!

263
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,810
>> YES!

264
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,311
>> YOU DID IT!

265
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,771
YOU DID IT!

266
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,273
[APPLAUSE]
>> Jeff: THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS

267
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,817
WHEN YOU BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.

268
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:22,616
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.

269
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,997
ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL MOMENTS
ON "SURVIVOR."

270
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:33,002
>> SHE DID IT.

271
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:38,883
>> Jeff: AUBRY, DEBBIE,
SIERRA, ANDREA, BRAD, HUGE

272
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:43,012
REWARD, BUT BEFORE WE GET TO
THAT, CIRIE, YOU DIDN'T GIVE UP,

273
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,055
AN YOU PULL IT OFF.

274
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,640
YOU DID IT.

275
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:52,354
WHAT IS THAT FEELING?

276
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,524
>> I HAVE THREE SONS, JUST TO
SHOW THEM THAT IT'S GOING TO BE

277
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:59,236
TOUGH IN LIFE, AS LONG AS YOU
TRY, EVEN IF YOU FAIL, I'M PROUD

278
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,408
OF THEM, AND GRATEFUL TO HAVE MY
TEAMMATES EVEN THOUGH THEY LOST

279
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:09,747
A GREAT REWARD, TO STILL SUPPORT
ME.

280
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,040
IT'S A LOT.

281
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,208
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

282
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:16,003
WINNING TEAM HUGE REWARD,
THEY'LL HEAD OUT, SEA PLANE WILL

283
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:24,553
PICK YOU UP, DROP YOU, SWIM OUT.

284
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:29,016
TROYZAN, SARAH, ZEKE, CIRIE,
TAI, I GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.

285
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,726
CIRIE, I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE YOU
SWIM.

286
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:35,231
I'M GOING TO BRING A BOAT IN FOR
YOU GUYS AND PICK UP MICHAELA ON

287
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,524
THE WAY OUT.

288
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:43,697
BRING A BOAT IN.

289
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:44,740
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

290
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:45,574
HEAD OUT.

291
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:50,037
YOU'RE GOING TO PICK UP
MICHAELA, TOO.

292
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,083
>> I'M LOOKING OVER AT MICHAELA,
AND I SEE A ROD UP PIECE OF

293
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:58,087
PAPER THAT SAYS "SECRET
ADVANTAGE."

294
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:09,974
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE MICHAELA
DIDN'T SEE THAT.

295
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,768
WITH "SURVIVOR" TO BE A GAME
CHANGER, YOU GOT TO BE LOOKING

296
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,979
CONSTANTLY FOR IDOLS AND CLUES,
AND NOW I HAVE A SECRET

297
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,273
ADVANTAGE.

298
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,401
SO THIS IS A HUGE WIN FOR ME.

299
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,752
>> OH, MY GOD.

300
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:39,837
LET'S GET A FIRE GOING.

301
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,426
>> ALTHOUGH WE LOST THE
CHALLENGE, IF I DIDN'T TRY TO

302
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:52,141
COMPLETE IT, I WOULD HAVE FELT
LIKE A COMPLETE FAILURE.

303
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,811
>> FOR ME TO NOT EVEN BE MAD
RIGHT NOW, THAT'S HOW PROUD I AM

304
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:56,312
OF YOU.

305
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,646
YOU WON'T FORGET THIS.

306
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:03,902
>> I JUST COULDN'T LET FEAR OR
EXHAUSTION STOP ME OR BEAT ME

307
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,779
THIS TIME.

308
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,073
>> YOUR KIDS WILL BE SO PROUD OF
YOU.

309
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,658
YOU CONQUERED IT.

310
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,160
YOU DID GOOD.

311
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,830
>> THANKS.

312
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:17,333
>> THIS IS A ROUGH GAME.

313
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,670
WE'RE ALL VYING FOR THE SAME
PRIZE, BUT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO

314
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:28,552
IT, THE PEOPLE THAT ARE PLAYING
ARE REALLY GOOD PEOPLE, AND IT

315
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,847
SHOWED IN THE WAY THAT THEY
HELPED ME TODAY.

316
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:37,645
I ME THAT I'M NOT A CHALLENGE
BEAST, SO IF I'VE ALWAYS JUST

317
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,104
DONE WHAT WAS NECESSARY TO GET
ME BY.

318
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:44,360
I DIDN'T WANT TO EVER PUSH
FURTHER THAN THAT, BECAUSE IT

319
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,195
WASN'T REALLY NECESSARY.

320
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:51,367
BUT DOING THAT, I'VE LIMITED
MYSELF IN A LOT OF WAYS.

321
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:56,538
I'M NOT LETTING MY MIND TELL ME,
BE AFRAID, DON'T DO IT, JUST

322
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,039
GIVE UP.

323
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,707
I CAN DO IT.

324
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:03,045
AND IF I CAN'T WIN THIS GAME BY
WINNING CHALLENGES, I'M GOING TO

325
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:07,049
DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO TRY TO
SOLIDIFY MY RELATIONSHIP IN THE

326
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,092
GAME.

327
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:11,345
IT'S GOING TO BE WHAT'S
NECESSARY FOR ME TO WIN THIS

328
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:17,184
GAME.

329
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:21,397
>> WHEN WE WEREN'T LEADING THE
CHALLENGE, I LOOKED OVER AT

330
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,608
MICHAELA, AND I SEE A SECRET
ADVANTAGE RIGHT AT HER FEET.

331
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,402
THAT'S CALLED ATTENTION TO
DETAIL.

332
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:30,364
I'M A POLICE OFFICER, BUT THE
NORMAL PERSON THAT DRIVES DOWN

333
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:34,910
THE ROAD WOULD NOT KNOW IF THE
CAR IN FRONT OF THEM'S

334
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:37,705
REGISTRATION TAGS ARE EXPIRED OR
NOT.

335
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,833
I WOULD.

336
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:41,667
"CONGRATULATIONS.

337
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,918
YOU'VE FOUND AN ADVANTAGE IN
THIS GAME.

338
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:49,091
YOU NOW HAVE THE RIGHT TO STEAL
A VOTE FROM SOMEONE AT TRIBAL

339
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,218
COUNCIL."

340
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,262
HOLY --
HAVING THIS ADVANTAGE OPENS UP

341
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:53,929
OPTIONS FOR ME.

342
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:57,057
I CAN COMPLETELY FLIP THE GAME.

343
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:00,894
"THIS VOTE IS NON-TRANSFERABLE
AND CANNOT BE STOLEN FROM YOU.

344
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:04,064
THE LAST TIME THIS EXTRA VOTE
CAN BE CAST IS WHEN THERE ARE

345
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,275
FIVE PEOPLE LEFT IN THE GAME."

346
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:11,780
IN THE PAST THESE EXTRA VOTES
HAVE NOT BEEN PLAYED CORRECTLY.

347
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:17,870
I'LL BE THE FIRST ONE TO PLAY
THIS VOTE CORRECTLY.

348
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,588
>> OH, MY GOD, WE'RE IN THE AIR.

349
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,673
THIS IS SO AMAZING.

350
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,759
>> OH, MY GOD, I LOVE AIRPLANES.

351
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:35,512
>> I AM A CAPTAIN IN THE CIVIL
AIR PATROL, THE AIR FORCE

352
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,057
AUXILIARY, SO I AM A HUGE FAN OF
AIRPLANES.

353
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,808
>> LOOK AT THE WATER, YOU GUYS.

354
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,142
>> BEAUTIFUL.

355
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,226
>> GORGEOUS.

356
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,270
>> THEY DON'T GET TO BE IN
AIRPLANES AS MUCH AS I DO.

357
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:46,482
SO IT'S REALLY FUN THE WATCH
THEIR FACES.

358
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,776
I APPRECIATE IT BECAUSE IT'S
LOOKING AT THE WORLD THROUGH A

359
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:49,651
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE.

360
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:53,655
YOU SEE EVERYTHING IN A WHOLE
NEW LIGHT.

361
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,366
OH, MY GOD.

362
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,702
>> THE BROWN EYE IS SO GOOD.

363
00:17:58,786 --> 00:17:59,787
>> IT'S HEAVEN.

364
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,329
>> I LIKE COLE SLAW.

365
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,165
>> CHEER, YOU GUYS.

366
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:03,832
>> CHEERS.

367
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,795
>> THANK YOU FOR PICKING US.

368
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:12,716
>> "SURVIVOR" 101, DON'T EVER
TAKE YOUR WHOLE CONTINGENCY ON A

369
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,884
REWARD.

370
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,844
SO TROYZAN GOT LEFT OFF ON
PURPOSE BECAUSE I NEEDED THEM TO

371
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,346
STAY TO BE MY EYES AND EARS BACK
AT CAMP.

372
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:21,183
YOU GOT FIVE ON THE OUTSIDE, ALL
IT TAKES IS ONE OR TWO TO FLIP

373
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,559
FOR THEM TO HAVE THE NUMBERS.

374
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,562
I NEED SOME PEOPLE I CAN TRUST
SO THE FIVE DON'T GET TOGETHER

375
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,023
AND CONTAMINATE OUR SIX.

376
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:30,859
>> HOW HAS YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH ZEKE GOING?

377
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,612
>> WHAT'S ALL THAT DRAMA ABOUT?

378
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,739
IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S TRYING TO
HIDE ANYTHING.

379
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,574
>> HE TURNED ON ME FOR NO
REASON.

380
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,283
FOR NO REASON.

381
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,535
IT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE.

382
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,871
I THINK WITH ALL THESE DIFFERENT
PLAYERS, HE'S NOT THE CENTER OF

383
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:46,041
ATTENTION, SO HE DECIDED TO TAKE
IT OUT ON ME.

384
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:51,088
IT WAS A WEIRD POWER PLAY, AND
HE... I DON'T KNOW.

385
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:55,342
I CAN CONFIDENTLY SAY I DON'T
KNOW IF LIFE CAN GET ANY BETTER

386
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,301
THAN RIGHT NOW TODAY.

387
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,553
AT THIS POINT THERE ARE 11
PEOPLE IN THE GAME.

388
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:01,390
IT'S KIND OF GREAT TO WATCH THE
FIVE PEOPLE WHO ARE FREE AGENTS

389
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:05,227
GET MAD AT EACH OTHER AND FALL
APART WHEN WHAT THEY SHOULD BE

390
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,604
DOING IS BECOMING STRONG AND
TRYING THE TAKE THE SIX OUT.

391
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,732
SO I NOW FEEL LIKE I HAVE
NOBODY.

392
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,901
>> I FEEL LIKE THE SIX IS SUPER
TIGHT.

393
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,404
I DON'T SEE WHY ANYBODY SHOULD
BREAK, AND I DON'T THINK WE

394
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,613
WILL.

395
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,408
AS OF NOW, I FEEL LIKE I'M IN
THE DRIVER'S SEAT, AND IT FEELS

396
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:26,582
GREAT.

397
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,960
>> TELL ME THIS: WHO DO YOU
THINK'S RUNNING THE SHOW?

398
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,254
>> SIERRA.

399
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,088
>> AND BRAD?

400
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,173
>> YEAH.

401
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,424
>> EVERYBODY KNOWS THEY'RE
RUNNING THINGS, AND IF THEY

402
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,760
CONTINUE, THEY'RE GOING TO PICK
OFF WHO THEY WANT UNTIL THEY GET

403
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:42,723
TO YOU, ME, AND WHOEVER ELSE,
AND THEY'LL GO TO THE END WITH

404
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,766
WHOEVER THEY CHOOSE.

405
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,937
I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH SARAH
TRYING TO GET HER TO SEE THAT

406
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,357
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE ON THE
BOTTOM OF BRAD AND CIERA'S

407
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,109
LITTLE GROUP.

408
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:57,446
I THINK DEEP DOWN SHE REALIZES
THAT, BUT IT'S JUST LIKE ME ON

409
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,739
THE BALANCE BEAM.

410
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:03,285
SHE KNOWS THE BEST THING FOR HER
TO DO IS TO CROSS THAT BEAM, BUT

411
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:07,247
SHE'S AFRAID.

412
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:10,459
>> IF I'M IN THE FINAL THREE
WITH THEM, DO STAND A CHANCE?

413
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,461
>> 100% HONEST WITH YOU?

414
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,629
NO.

415
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:17,090
I'M JUST BEING STRAIGHT UP,
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT SARAH,

416
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,010
THEY CAN COUNT ON HER AT THE
VOTE, BUT THEN THEY'RE GOING TO

417
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:20,886
SAY THEY CARRIED YOU.

418
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,347
SHE DIDN'T DO NOTHING, I DID
EVERYTHING.

419
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,682
WHEN THE JURY HEARS THAT...

420
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:26,934
>> RIGHT.

421
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:30,812
>> I PROMISED MYSELF COMING OUT
HERE THATLY NOT MAKE THE SAME

422
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,522
MISTAKE I MADE THE FIRST TIME I
PLAYED.

423
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:37,986
WHAT I DID IN CAGAYAN WAS LOOK
FOR THE SAFEST ROUTE I COULD GO.

424
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,032
I SAT BACK, DIDN'T MAKE THE
MOVES, AND LET OTHER PEOPLE MAKE

425
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,158
THE DECISIONS.

426
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:44,034
THAT DIDN'T WORK.

427
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,827
IT GOT ME ON THE JURY.

428
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,206
AND NOT EVEN CLOSE TO A SHOT AT
$1 MILLION.

429
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:49,790
>> OKAY.

430
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:50,958
THIS IS US TALKING REAL.

431
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,001
>> OKAY.

432
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,546
SO IF IT WAS YOU, ME, MICHAELA,
AUBRY, THERE'S FOUR.

433
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,341
>> MAYBE ZEKE WOULD GO.

434
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,133
I DON'T KNOW.

435
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,511
>> HE WOULD GO WHERE WE WENT I
THINK.

436
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,345
THAT'S FIVE.

437
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:07,265
BUT ARE WE DONE WITH ANDREA OR
WHAT?

438
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,976
IS IT REPAIRABLE WITH HER?

439
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,811
>> ABSOLUTELY.

440
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,397
>> THERE ARE SMALL WINDOWS OF
OPPORTUNITIES IN THIS GAME, AND

441
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,358
IF YOU MISS THEM, YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO WIN.

442
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,819
HOWEVER, THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT
TIMING.

443
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:22,864
AND I'M NOT SURE THE TIMING IS
RIGHT TO MAKE A BIG MOVE.

444
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:27,536
BUT I'M READY FOR IT IN THE
EVENT THAT IT IS.

445
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:51,393
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

446
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:59,067
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

447
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,068
ALL RIGHT.

448
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,903
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY IDOL?

449
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,030
>> YES, SIR.

450
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:09,536
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
TAI, GOT THE TAKE IT BACK.

451
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:10,746
THANK YOU.

452
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,915
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.

453
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,085
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO PULL ON A ROPE,

454
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,920
BALANCING A WOBBLY TABLE.

455
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,507
YOU'LL THEN RACE TO STACK WOODEN
BLOCKS ON THAT TABLE ONE LETTER

456
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:27,262
AT A TIME SPELLING "IMMUNITY."

457
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,891
IF YOUR TABLE WOBBLES AND THE
STACK FALLS, YOU GOT THE START

458
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,059
OVER.

459
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:35,896
FIRST PERSON TO FINISH WINS
IMMUNITY, GUARANTEED SAFETY AT

460
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,397
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

461
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,650
LOSERS, AFTER 26 DAYS, SOMEONE
WILL BE VOTED OUT AND BECOME THE

462
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:44,112
THIRD MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

463
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:51,953
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS AND GET
STARTED.

464
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:52,579
ALL RIGHT.

465
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:55,248
HERE WE GO, FOR IMMUNITY?

466
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,417
SURVIVORS READY?

467
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,587
GO!

468
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,963
WE'RE LOOKING FOR THOSE EIGHT
LETTERS.

469
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:05,300
ONCE YOU HAVE THEM, TAKE THAT
FIRST LETTER AND RACE UP AND GET

470
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,470
STARTED.

471
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,139
YOU'RE SPELLING THE WORD
"IMMUNITY."

472
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:15,143
BUT YOU HAVE TO DO IT WHILE
BALANCING THOSE BLOCKS ON A VERY

473
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,980
WOBBLY TABLE.

474
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,607
EVERYBODY BUT TAI WORKING ON
THEIR FIRST LETTER.

475
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,819
I'M NOT SURE WHAT TAI IS
STRUGGLING WITH.

476
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:27,155
THIS CHALLENGE IS ALL ABOUT
PATIENCE.

477
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,992
FASTER YOU GO, THE MORE RISKS
YOU TAKE.

478
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,494
ANDREA COMING BACK WITH HER
SECOND LETTER.

479
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,121
THERE GOES TAI.

480
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:37,707
TAI IS NOW DOWN ON THE GROUND.

481
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,668
HE'S REALIZING HE HEADED OUT
WITHOUT A BLOCK.

482
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:43,672
HERE COMES DEBBIE AND SIERRA
WITH THEIR SECOND.

483
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,715
CULPEPPER HAS HIS SECOND.

484
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:52,973
ANDREA PLACES HER SECOND LETTER.

485
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:58,353
TAI STILL STRUGGLING TRYING TO
MAKE SURE HE'S SPELLING

486
00:23:58,436 --> 00:23:58,812
"IMMUNITY" RIGHT.

487
00:23:58,895 --> 00:23:59,896
>> I CAN'T THINK.

488
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,525
>> Jeff: 26 DAYS ON SURVIVOR
CAN REALLY TAKE ITS TOLL.

489
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,527
TROYZAN HAS TWO LETTERS.

490
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,530
IT IS ANDREA IN THE EARLY LEAD,
HEADING BACK WITH HER THIRD

491
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,698
LETTER.

492
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,408
AUBRY WITH TWO.

493
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,702
HERE COMES MICHAELA WITH HER
SECOND.

494
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:17,581
ZEKE AND CIRIE MOVING SLOWLY.

495
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:27,507
TAI FINALLY HAS HIS FIRST
LETTER.

496
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,092
ANDREA PLACES HER FOURTH LETTER.

497
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,386
SHE IS HALF-WAY THERE.

498
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,722
HERE COMES TROYZAN RIGHT BEHIND
WITH HIS FOURTH.

499
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,765
CULPEPPER COMING OUT WITH HIS
FOURTH.

500
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:41,062
A LOT OF PEOPLE RIGHT BEHIND
ANDREA, TROYZAN AND CULPEPPER.

501
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:45,066
IT IS STILL ANYBODY'S CHALLENGE
TO WIN.

502
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,279
THE TALLER THAT STACK GETS, THE
MORE DIFFICULT IT BECOMES TO

503
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,155
BALANCE.

504
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,240
HERE COMES ANDREA WITH HER FIFTH
LETTER.

505
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,909
STILL IN THE LEAD.

506
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:59,039
TROYZAN RIGHT BEHIND HER, STEPS
BEHIND HER WITH HIS FIFTH.

507
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,540
ANDREA BIG SWINGS.

508
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:05,128
SHE HAS NOT DROPPED YET.

509
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:05,754
SARAH DROPS.

510
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,714
SHE'S GOT TO START AGAIN.

511
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,758
YOU NEVER GIVE UP IN THIS
CHALLENGE BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN

512
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,969
DROP AT ANY TIME.

513
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,764
ANDREA REACHING FOR THAT SIXTH
BLOCK.

514
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,933
AND THAT'S WHERE IT CAN GET
DANGEROUS.

515
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:22,604
YOU REACH BACK WITH YOUR RIGHT
HAND AND YOUR LEFT HAND DROPS.

516
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:23,230
AUBRY DROPS.

517
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:26,858
SHE'S GOT THE START AGAIN.

518
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,696
RIGHT NOW IT'S ANDREA AND
TROYZAN, AND THEY ARE NECK AND

519
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,907
NECK.

520
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,784
TROYZAN HAS CAUGHT ANDREA.

521
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,118
BOTH COMING BACK WITH THEIR
SEVENTH LETTER.

522
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,829
TROYZAN PLACES HIS FIRST, THEN
ANDREA.

523
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,206
>> YOU GOT IT, TROYZAN.

524
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,457
TAKE YOUR TIME, BUDDY.

525
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,125
>> Jeff: THAT STACK IS SO
HIGH.

526
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:50,799
IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH TO DROP.

527
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:51,967
ANDREA DROPS EVERYTHING.

528
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,469
THE DOOR IS OPEN FOR TROYZAN
NOW.

529
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:59,641
HE'S GOT TO GET OUT, PLACE THE
"I" AND THEN GET ALL THE WAY

530
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,809
BACK WITHOUT DROPPING.

531
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,311
CULL PEPPER THE ONLY ONE WHO
MIGHT CATCH HIM, BUT HE WOULD

532
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,814
HAVE TO PICK UP THE PACE.

533
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,983
AND CULPEPPER DROPS EVERYTHING.

534
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,776
>> YOU GOT PLENTY OF TIME.

535
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:10,944
TAKE YOUR TIME.

536
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:14,322
>> Jeff: TROYZAN CAN REALLY
TAKE HIS TIME NOBODY IS CLOSE

537
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:14,823
RIGHT NOW.

538
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,658
>> TAKE YOUR TIME.

539
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,036
>> Jeff: IT WOULD BE TROYZAN'S
FIRST INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY WIN

540
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,290
THIS SEASON.

541
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:27,961
GOT TO GET UP ON THAT PLATFORM.

542
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,088
AND HE DOES!

543
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:33,383
TROYZAN WINS INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY, SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL

544
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:41,808
COUNCIL.

545
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:42,892
TROYZAN, COME ON OVER.

546
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:49,232
>> GOOD JOB, TROYZAN.

547
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,985
>> OH, IT LOOKS IS GOOD ON YOU,
BUDDY.

548
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,863
>> Jeff: TROYZAN SAFE TONIGHT
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

549
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,823
CANNOT BE VOTED OUT OF THIS
GAME.

550
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,533
STILL HAVE A SHOT AT WINNING IT.

551
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:03,246
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 26
DAYS, YOUR SHOT AT WINNING

552
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,374
"SURVIVOR" WILL ONCE AGAIN FALL
SHORT.

553
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,044
SOMEBODY GOING HOME, TENTH
PERSON VOTED OUT, THIRD MEMBER

554
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,754
OF OUR JURY, IT WON'T BE YOU.

555
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,589
CONGRATS.

556
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:13,298
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

557
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,216
SEE YOU GUYS TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

558
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,218
>> THANKS, JEFF.

559
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,887
>> LUCKILY ONE OF MY POWER
STICKS WON IMMUNITY.

560
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,390
WE HAVE THE POWER TO CHOOSE WHO
GOES HOME.

561
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,392
THE SMART MOVE IS TO CHOOSE
ANDREA.

562
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,727
ANDREA IS SOMEONE WHO NEEDS TO
GO HOME.

563
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,396
SHE'S A HUGE THREAT IN THIS
GAME.

564
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,065
SHE NEEDS TO GO.

565
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,207
>> GOOD JOB, TROYZAN.

566
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:47,582
>> GREAT JOB.

567
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:51,419
>> GOOD JOB.

568
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:55,256
>> WOW, THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE,
I GUESS ON A SCALE OF ONE TO

569
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,926
TEN, WAS AN 11 BECAUSE I WON.

570
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,428
AND I SURPRISED MYSELF.

571
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,888
NOW THERE'S A ALLIANCE OF SIX.

572
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:04,641
WE JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHO
IS GOING HOME.

573
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,935
>> WE NEED TO GET MORE COCONUTS.

574
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,395
WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH IT SO
FAST.

575
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,437
>> I'LL GO.

576
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:17,320
>> I'LL GO WITH YOU.

577
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:21,783
>> ALL DAY.

578
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:22,992
>> IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.

579
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:26,913
>> AT THIS POINT I THINK THE SIX
OF US ARE SO SICK OF MICHAELA

580
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:32,627
THAT IT'S VERY TEMPTING TO VOTE
HER OUT, HOWEVER, I REALLY THINK

581
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,422
WE HAVE A BIGGER THREAT TO DEAL
WITH FIRST.

582
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,131
>> MICHAELA.

583
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,006
>> NO, NO, NO.

584
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,466
HEAR ME OUT.

585
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,134
>> I WILL.

586
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:39,801
>> I CAN'T STAND HER, BUT...

587
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,636
>> I KNOW.

588
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:42,887
>> ANDREA IS TOO GOOD.

589
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,974
IT'S THE ONLY WAY WE LOSE OUR
SIX IS IF ANDREA IS WINNING AND

590
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,268
SHE MOVES IN AND WE HAVE TO EAT
ONE OF OUR OWN.

591
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:52,188
>> I WOULD LOVE TO VOTE OUT
MICHAELA BECAUSE SHE'S HIGHLY

592
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,190
ANNOYING AND JUST HAS A BAD
ATTITUDE.

593
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,484
>> SURE WE CAN'T JUST GET RID OF
HER TONIGHT?

594
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,193
>> NO.

595
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:57,986
NO, NO, NO.

596
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,112
WE GOT TO DO IT TOMORROW.

597
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:01,114
>> HOWEVER, I'M A TEAM PLAYER.

598
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:05,452
SO IF BRAD WANTS TO TAKE OUT
ANDREA, I'M COOL WITH IT.

599
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,203
SHE'S THE BIGGEST STRATEGIC
THREAT.

600
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,830
SHE'S THE BIGGEST PHYSICAL
THREAT.

601
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:12,625
AND YOU TAKE THE SHOT THE MOMENT
YOU GET THE OPPORTUNITY.

602
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:16,171
THE BEST TIME IS RIGHT NOW.

603
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,505
GO!

604
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:22,177
>> I THINK WE GO US SIX, ANDREA,
AND WE TELL EVERYBODY ELSE
MICHAELA.

605
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,679
>> JUST IN CASE SHE HAS AN IDOL.

606
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:26,055
>> DON'T WORRY.

607
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,348
EVERYBODY WANTS THE WORK WITH
US.

608
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,184
EVERYBODY.

609
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:34,731
>> THE PLAN WAS MADE WITHOUT
EVEN ASKING ME, AND I REALIZED

610
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:38,818
AT THAT POINT, I'M NOT HIGH IN
THE PECKING ORDER IN THAT

611
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:39,819
SIXESOME.

612
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:46,826
SO IT MIGHT BE TIME FOR ME TO
MAKE MY MOVE.

613
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,036
>> WHAT'S UP?

614
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:54,375
>> DO YOU THINK GOING WITH BRAD
AND SIERRA IS THE RIGHT MOVE?

615
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,210
BECAUSE YOU CAN MAKE A MOVE.

616
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,045
>> I'M ALWAYS READY TO MAKE A
MOVE.

617
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,548
>> THE THING ABOUT THE POWER
ALLIANCE IS I UNDERSTAND WHERE I

618
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,717
STAND WITH THEM.

619
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,888
I JUST HAVE TO STAND WITH MY
TAIL TUCKED BETWEEN MY LEGS AND

620
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,433
KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT AND VOTE HOW
THEY WANT ME TO VOTE.

621
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,227
THAT'S NOT REALLY HOW I WANT THE
MAKE THIS GAME.

622
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,020
>> WE'RE GOING THE NEED ANDREA.

623
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,564
>> GREAT.

624
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,901
>> HOWEVER, TO DO THIS, WE GOT
TO BRING IN ANDREA, WHO I HAVE

625
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,152
NO DESIRE TO WORK WITH.

626
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,697
BUT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL
WITH IT, AT LEAST FOR ONE VOTE.

627
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:28,034
>> I JUST FEEL LIKE RIGHT NOW
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE

628
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:28,368
MY PLAY IS.

629
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:29,744
>> WELL...

630
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:30,912
>> I HAVE NOTHING RIGHT NOW.

631
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,081
>> SO WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO
FROM HERE.

632
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,082
>> I WANTED TO WORK WITH YOU.

633
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,752
>> YES.

634
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:38,461
WE STILL CAN.

635
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,045
I'M STILL GOOD WITH YOU GUYS.

636
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,088
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

637
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,716
>> IT'S OBVIOUS THERE'S A POWER
ALLIANCE.

638
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,342
>> I KNOW.

639
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,593
>> I'M IN THE THAT ALLIANCE.

640
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,303
>> BUT YOU'RE ON THE BOTTOM OF
THAT.

641
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,513
>> I KNOW.

642
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:53,726
DON'T YOU THINK WORKING WITH THE
ENEMY COULD BE A GOOD THING?

643
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,478
>> IT'S GREAT.

644
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,231
IF SARAH'S WILLING THE MAKE A
MOVE, I'M TOTALLY ON BOARD.

645
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:00,775
BECAUSE I KNOW I HAVE A HUGE
TARGET ON MY BACK.

646
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:04,404
NOW, AS FAR AS ZEKE, WILL I
TRUST HIM AGAIN FULLY, OF COURSE

647
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:12,620
NOT, BUT RIGHT NOW I'M LOOKING
FOR ANYONE THAT WANTS TO PLAY.

648
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,790
>> DAY 26.

649
00:31:15,873 --> 00:31:17,625
I ONLY MADE IT TO DAY 19 LAST
TIME.

650
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,459
>> CONGRATS.

651
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:18,960
>> THANKS.

652
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,003
>> THAT'S HUNTING.

653
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,630
>> I THINK FORMING A
RELATIONSHIP IS SUPER IMPORTANT

654
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,756
IN THIS GAME.

655
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,259
AND ME AND SARAH ARE REALLY
CLOSE.

656
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,510
WE'VE REALLY CONNECTED.

657
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:31,139
SO I STILL FEEL SUPER CONFIDENT
IN SARAH, AND I THINK IT WILL BE

658
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,475
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING IF WE WERE AT
THE FINAL THREE TOGETHER.

659
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,311
>> THIS IS MY BIG PICTURE.

660
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,981
I DON'T CARE HOW WE GET RID OF
THESE PEOPLE, BUT AT THE END I

661
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,107
THINK IT'S ME, YOU AND DEBBIE.

662
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,485
>> WE'RE THE FINAL THREE.

663
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:49,657
>> I HAD THIS PLAN THE BLIND
SIDE THE POWER GROUP, AND THEN

664
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:54,120
SIERRA PROPOSES THIS IDEA THAT
ME, HER AND DEBBIE ARE A FINAL

665
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,371
THREE.

666
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:59,375
AN I WAS LIKE, HOLY CRAP, MAYBE
I'M NOT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SIX

667
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,501
AT ALL.

668
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,252
>> THAT'S PERFECT.

669
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,128
DOESN'T THAT SOUND GREAT?

670
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,380
>> YEAH.

671
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,506
AS LONG AS NOBODY FLIPS.

672
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,549
>> THAT'S IT.

673
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:07,050
THAT'S THE GAME, SARAH.

674
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:14,182
>> RIGHT.

675
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,727
>> BASICALLY THE SIX OF US
TONIGHT ARE GOING TO AGREE ON A

676
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,520
VOTE, SARAH DOESN'T TRUST YOU.

677
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,104
THAT'S HER PROBLEM.

678
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,522
I DO.

679
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,149
BUT MICHAELA IS GOING HOME.

680
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:27,528
I TOLD AUBRY TO VOTE FOR
MICHAELA IN CASE ANDREA PULLS AN

681
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:32,075
IDOL, THEN MICHAELA GOES HOME,
PLUS I TOLD HER SIERRA DOESN'T

682
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:35,203
TRUST HER BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH
SHE SCREWED ME OVER THE LAST

683
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:38,164
TIME I PLAYED, I WANT AUBRY TO
THINK I'M WITH HER.

684
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:41,000
IF YOU WORK WITH ME, IF YOU
CONTINUE TO SHOW ME THAT I CAN

685
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,795
TRUST YOU, THERE'S A WAY IN.

686
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:47,757
>> OKAY.

687
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,383
>> IT WOULD BE STUPID TO.

688
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,551
>> AND YOU'RE NOT STUPID.

689
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,720
>> DOWN THE LINE I MAY NEED TO
USE AUBRY.

690
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,890
TO DO THAT I NEED HER TO THINK
I'M HER BEST FRIEND, AND I THINK

691
00:32:55,973 --> 00:33:01,396
IT'S WORKING.

692
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,397
>> OKAY.

693
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,066
SO HERE'S THE DEAL, THEY'RE
TRYING TO COME AT YOU.

694
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,735
DEBBIE'S LIKE, YOU'RE SAFE,
AUBRY, AND THE WAY SHE SAID IT,

695
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,780
I'M LIKE, OKAY.

696
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,115
>> THEY'RE SO COCKY.

697
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,408
THEY'RE SO COCKY.

698
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:17,412
>> DEBBIE REMINDS ME NOW AS SHE
DID AROUND THE TIME I VOTED HER

699
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,748
OUT OF "SURVIVOR."

700
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:24,585
SHE STARTS TO GET COCKY AND THEN
MAKES MISTAKES.

701
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:28,798
>> DEBBIE'S LIKE, SARAH WANTS TO
CUT YOUR THROAT, I DON'T TRUST

702
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,591
HER, AUBRY, YOU'RE THE ONE I
WANT IN.

703
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,051
>> WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM?

704
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,761
>> THAT REALLY PISSES ME OFF.

705
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,345
I HATE LYING.

706
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,764
>> SHE'S A GRADE-A LIAR.

707
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:40,101
>> SO I WAS THINKING, I MIGHT
WANT TO SIT IN THE FINAL THREE

708
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,311
WITH DEBBIE, BUT NOW SHE'S
SPREADING LIES ABOUT ME.

709
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,146
>> WE HAVE YOUR BACK.

710
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:46,274
I SWEAR TO YOU...

711
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,109
>> AT THIS POINT, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

712
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:53,948
IF I CAN CONTROL DEBBIE, COULD
BE IN THE TOP SIX FOR SURE

713
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:55,450
POTENTIALLY IN THE FINAL THREE.

714
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,827
YOU UNDERSTAND THE PREDICAMENT
I'M IN?

715
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,911
>> YES.

716
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:02,790
>> IT'S REALLY HARD TO LEAVE
SAFETY FOR THE UNKNOWN.

717
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,251
HOWEVER, I SWORE THE MYSELF
COMING OUT HERE I'M GOING THE

718
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:10,423
MAKE BIG MOVES.

719
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:14,469
WHATEVER I DO, IT'S GOING TO
DETERMINE HOW FAR I GO IN THIS

720
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,013
GAME.

721
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:31,694
I'M GOING TO DECIDE AT TRIBAL.

722
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:37,283
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

723
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:44,832
HALI AND OZZY VOTED OUT AT THE
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

724
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:49,837
SO AS OUR JURY STARTS TO GROW,
THIS GAME GETS MORE COMPLICATED,

725
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,341
BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE TO FIND A
WAY THE USE TRIBAL AS A WAY TO

726
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,301
START MAKING YOUR CASE.

727
00:34:55,384 --> 00:35:00,807
SO WITH THAT IN MIND, LET'S TALK
ABOUT THE REWARD CHALLENGE.

728
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,352
CIRIE, YOU ARE OUT IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE OCEAN STUCK, AND THEN

729
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,394
SOMETHING AMAZING HAPPENED.

730
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:09,023
YOU DECIDED, I'M NOT COMING IN
UNTIL I FINISH THIS.

731
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:11,734
NOW THAT YOU'VE HAD A LITTLE BIT
OF TIME TO THINK BACK, WHAT WAS

732
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,860
THAT ABOUT?

733
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:17,365
>> THE FACT THAT I COULDN'T MAKE
IT ON THE PLATFORM WAS

734
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,533
HUMILIATING I GUESS.

735
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:25,289
AND THE FACT THAT ALL OF THESE
GUYS WERE WILLING TO HELP ME

736
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:31,712
INSPIRED ME MORE TO NOT WANT TO
END ON A FAILURE.

737
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,841
>> Jeff: SARAH, YOU WENT FROM
FRUSTRATED TRIBE MAID TO ANOTHER

738
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,343
HUMAN SEEING SOMEBODY TRYING
THEIR BEST AND FAILING, AND YOU

739
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:38,553
DOVE IN.

740
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:43,599
>> WATCHING CIRIE STRUGGLE OUT
THERE, I DON'T KNOW HOW ANYBODY

741
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,394
COULD LEAVE ANYBODY BEHIND LIKE
THAT.

742
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:51,065
BUT IT CAME DOWN TO HER
DECIDING, I CAN DO SOMETHING

743
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:54,402
THAT I THOUGHT I COULDN'T DO,
AND SHE PROVED IT TO HERSELF AND

744
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,363
EVERYBODY ELSE.

745
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,281
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

746
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,908
NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

747
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,076
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY.

748
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:06,122
ANDREA, IT'S DEVASTATION THAT
THE ONE THING YOU NEED WALKING

749
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:09,417
INTO THIS GAME WAS WITHIN
MOMENTS OF BEING YOURS.

750
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,420
>> I MEAN, I'M ESPECIALLY
VULNERABLE TONIGHT, BECAUSE I'M

751
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:15,047
ON THE BOTTOM.

752
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:18,509
SO THAT CHALLENGE WAS SO
IMPORTANT, AND THOSE BLOCKS

753
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,595
FALLING COULD BE THE REASON I GO
HOME TONIGHT.

754
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:23,431
>> Jeff: WHAT MAKES YOU
CERTAIN YOU'RE ON THE BOTTOM?

755
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,266
>> AFTER THE LAST TRIBAL
COUNCIL, I FOUND MYSELF OUT OF

756
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:30,396
THE LOOP, SO DID A COUPLE OTHER
PEOPLE, AND THERE'S A VERY CLEAR

757
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,273
MAJORITY ALLIANCE AND A VERY
CLEAR BOTTOM.

758
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,151
>> Jeff: ZEKE, YOU ARE SHAKING
YOUR HEAD AS SHE WAS EXPLAINING

759
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,444
THAT.

760
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:40,615
>> OH, YEAH, TAI AND DEBBIE AND
BRAD AND SIERRA AND TROYZAN AND

761
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,784
SARAH, THE SIX OF THEM GOT UP,
WALKED INTO THE WOODS, AND I

762
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,328
GUESS THEY HAD MADE THEIR
DECISION ABOUT WHO WAS TO GO

763
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,329
HOME.

764
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,789
>> Jeff: DEBBIE, YOU'RE
SMILING VERY KNOWINGLY.

765
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:54,962
>> WELL, I WAS IN THAT SIX, AND
WE CAME TO A UNANIMOUS DECISION

766
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,966
THROUGH DIALOGUE, RESPECT,
EVERYBODY TAKES A TURN,

767
00:36:59,050 --> 00:36:59,467
EVERYBODY SPEAKS.

768
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,593
IT TOOK TEN MINUTES.

769
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,803
>> Jeff: AND ANDREA, THAT
BRINGS US BACK TO YOU.

770
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,806
THIS IS YOUR FEAR, THAT THE SIX
HAVE DECIDED IT'S YOU.

771
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:10,978
>> SO THE WORD ON THE STREET WAS
IT WAS MICHAELA, BUT IF THE

772
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,189
ALLIANCE IS SMART, THEY WOULD
LEAK FALSE INFORMATION.

773
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:16,484
ALSO IT FELT LIKE EVERYONE WAS
CHEERING AS SOON AS MY BLOCKS

774
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,111
FELL AT THE CHALLENGE, SO THERE
ARE A COUPLE CLUES THAT IT'S

775
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,322
POSSIBLY NOT MICHAELA AND IT'S
MAYBE ME.

776
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,533
>> Jeff: SARAH, WHAT'S IT LIKE
TO BE PART OF THE GROUP THAT'S

777
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:29,330
BEING SINGLED OUT AS THE ONES IN
CHARGE MAKING THE DECISIONS?

778
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:32,500
>> WELL, "SURVIVOR" IS ALL ABOUT
BEING ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE

779
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,668
NUMBERS.

780
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,796
YOU CAN SEE CLEAR FRUSTRATION
FROM THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ON

781
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:43,302
THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE NUMBERS,
BUT CAN YOU BLAME US FOR FEELING
SECURE?

782
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:46,472
>> Jeff: DEBBIE, IS THAT A
FAIR STATEMENT, THAT PERCEPTION

783
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:49,475
IS WHAT DICTATES WHETHER PEOPLE
ARE HAPPY ABOUT WAY THE GAME IS

784
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,978
BEING PLAYED OR FRUSTRATED?

785
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:55,856
>> IT IS INCONCEIVABLE FOR
ANYBODY TO CONCLUDE AT THIS

786
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,360
POINT THAT THERE IS ANYTHING
OTHER THAN A STRONG SIX SITTING

787
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,320
HERE TONIGHT.

788
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,989
SO IS PERCEPTION REALITY?

789
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,365
WELL, IT IS.

790
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:08,369
WE'VE GOT A SIX THAT HAS A VERY
ACCURATE PERCEPTION OF

791
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,204
THEMSELVES, AND WE JUST CLICK.

792
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:14,542
>> Jeff: TROYZAN, HOW DOES THE
SIX MANAGE TO STAY TOGETHER WITH

793
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,460
EVERYBODY BELIEVING THEY'RE AT
THE TOP WHEN THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE?

794
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:21,632
>> IF YOU'RE SMART ENOUGH TO GET
YOUR DAMN SELF TO SIX, TAKE IT.

795
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:25,886
I MEAN, THAT'S A HUGE PLUS.

796
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:26,721
COME ON.

797
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,848
I MEAN, ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN
AFTER THAT.

798
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,516
IT CHANGES ALL THE TIME.

799
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,519
>> Jeff: SO ZEKE, TROYZAN IS
SAYING, WORRY ABOUT SIX WHEN YOU

800
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,938
GET THERE, BUT YOU GOT TO GET
THERE.

801
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,064
>> THAT'S VERY TRUE.

802
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:40,443
I LIKE TO SAY THAT THE DECK
RESHUFFLES AFTER SOMEONE IS

803
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,611
VOTED OUT.

804
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,906
I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'M COUNTING
ON TONIGHT, IS FOR THE DECK TO
RESHUFFLE & WHO KNOWS WHO IS
GOING TO BE UPSET WITHIN

805
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:50,077
THE SIX TOMORROW AND MAYBE
THAT'S MYMOMENT TO STRETCH.

806
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,456
>> Jeff: SARAH, INTERESTING
WAY THAT ZEKE DESCRIBED IT.

807
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:57,251
>> SURE, PEOPLE COULD AGREE WITH
THAT, BUT LIKE TROYZAN SAID, IF

808
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:01,213
YOU ARE SIX, MAYBE YOU CAN GET
TO FIVE, TO FOUR, TO THREE.

809
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:06,719
SO I THINK IT'S WISHFUL THINKING
TO SAY THAT THE DECK RESHUFFLES.

810
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:10,097
>> Jeff: MICHAELA, YOU HAD A
REACTION TO THAT

811
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,976
>> SHE'S BASICALLY SAYING, Y'ALL
DON'T GO NO SHOT.

812
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,771
YOU CAN SIT HERE KEEP WATCHING
US WIN THIS GAME OR YOU CAN MAKE

813
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:17,480
A MOVE.

814
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:21,776
SO I DIDN'T GET NO MARCH NOTICE.

815
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,070
THEY THINK I'M ABOUT THE MARCH
MYSELF OUT.

816
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,781
I RATHER MARCH OUT SWING,
TELLING THE TRUTH, LIKE I ALWAYS

817
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,575
DO, THAN SIT HERE LIKE I DON'T
SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.

818
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:32,620
WE ALL KNOW WHO IS RUNNING THE
SHOW, AND YOU CAN EITHER DO

819
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,498
SOMETHING ABOUT IT WHILE YOU
HAVE NUMBERS, OR YOU CAN SIT

820
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:40,586
HERE LOOKING LIKE BOO BOO THE
FOOL.

821
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:41,087
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

822
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,464
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

823
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:50,805
CULPEPPER, YOU'RE UP.

824
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,772
>> ACTUALLY IN OUR SIX, THERE
ARE NO PEOPLE WHO GIVE ORDERS

825
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:00,523
AND IN PEOPLE WHO TAKE ORDERS.

826
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:13,244
IT'S CALLED A DEMOCRACY.

827
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:18,124
>> YOU THINK YOU ARE RUNNING THE
SHOW, BUT I HOPE YOU'RE IN FOR A

828
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:28,175
REALLY RUDE AWAKENING.

829
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:34,515
REALLY RUDE AWAKENING.

830
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:42,857
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

831
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,026
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND NOW WANT THE PLAY IT,

832
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:50,739
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

833
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:51,699
OKAY.

834
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,367
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.

835
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,578
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED THE LEAVE THE TRIBAL

836
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:56,745
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

837
00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:02,501
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

838
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,712
FIRST VOTE, ANDREA.

839
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,840
DEBBIE.

840
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:08,883
ANDREA.

841
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,844
THAT'S TWO VOTES ANDREA.

842
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:12,803
DEBBIE.

843
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:16,432
TWO VOTES ANDREA, TWO VOTES
DEBBIE.

844
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:17,099
ANDREA.

845
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:20,227
THAT'S THREE VOTES ANDREA.

846
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,061
DEBBIE.

847
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,440
THREE VOTES ANDREA, THREE VOTES
DEBBIE.

848
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:25,065
ANDREA.
