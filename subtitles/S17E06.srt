You'll be bringing with you

193
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,565
everything you need for a nice

194
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,151
afternoon picnic.

195
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:00,818
(gasps)

196
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:01,069
>> Beer.

197

>> PROBST: You have some bread,

199
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,739
veggies, meats, cheeses...

200
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:05,698
>> Cheese!

201
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,574
>> PROBST: ...some nice drinks.

202
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:10,411
It should be a fun afternoon.

203
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,913
In addition, the winning tribe

204
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,372
will send one member of the

205
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,083
losing tribe to Exile Island.

206
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:15,625
Worth playing for?

207
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,667
>> OTHERS: Oh, yeah. Yeah.

208
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:17,710
>> PROBST: Kota, you have two

209
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:18,044
extra members.

210
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,712
Who's gonna sit this one out?

211
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,297
Charlie and I would like to be

212
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,173
the cheerleaders today.

213
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:22,924
>> PROBST: Corinne, Charlie,

214
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,300
take a spot on the bench.

215
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:24,926
Everybody else, I'll give you a

216
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:25,551
minute to strategize, we'll get

217
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:29,472
started.

218
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,308
First round, Randy, the attacker

219
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,227
for Kota, will be going up

220
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,603
against Fang.

221
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:38,523
Ace, the attacker for Fang,

222
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,565
he'll be going up against Kota.

223
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,609
Fang looking to break a

224
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:45,029
five-challenge losing streak.

225
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:48,157
Survivors, ready...

226
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,618
Go!

227
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,995
Ace goes after Bob in the Kota

228
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,956
ring.

229
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,791
Randy very aggressive in the

230
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,543
Fang ring.

231
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:58,793
>> Yes!

232
00:06:58,876 --> 00:06:59,585
>> PROBST: Ball hits the ground.

233
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,629
Kota scores first point!

234
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:01,879
(cheering)

235
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,548
>> Yeah, Kota!

236
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,924
>> Over.

237
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,467
>> PROBST: Kota leads: one-zip.

238
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,928
Next round, Bob, the attacker

239
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,596
for Kota, Sugar, the attacker

240
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,597
for Fang.

241
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,516
>> (growls)

242
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,892
>> This guy is so ugly over

243
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:15,101
here.

244
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,727
He's such an ugly person.

245
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:17,770
He's mean.

246
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:18,896
>> PROBST: This should be fun.

247
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,400
>> Yeah.

Go!

250
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,489
Sugar being aggressive, giving

251
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,699
everything she has trying to

252
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,492
score for Fang.

253
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,036
Bob takes Kenny out, doesn't

254
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,912
help.

255
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,122
Fang's still alive.

256
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:36,706
Bob takes a hard fall.

257
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,541
Stay after him, Sugar.

258
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,584
Be a hero.

259
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,001
>> (laughs): Okay.

260
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,670
>> PROBST: Fang needs to score.

261
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,464
Sugar, you need to pick it up.

262
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,800
Do not drop that ball.

263
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:48,551
>> (grunts)

264
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,886
>> PROBST: Big takedown from

265
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:50,511
Bob!

266
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,637
It doesn't work, though-- Ace

267
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,096
keeps the ball alive.

268
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,723
>> Nice, Ace!

269
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,641
>> PROBST: Sugar doing

270
00:07:55,725 --> 00:08:00,062
nothing, absolutely nothing.

>> Come on, Sugar!

272
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:01,939
>> PROBST: Sugar's gonna have to

273
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,816
get aggressive, try to make

274
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,152
something happen.

275
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,112
Bob almost deflects it!

276
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,822
No! Another takedown by Bob on

277
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,782
Matty!

278
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:12,116
>> (laughing)

279
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,118
>> Come on, Sugar!

280
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:14,744
>> PROBST: Ace tries to get it

281
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,996
past Bob, but Bob shuts him

282
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,372
down!

283
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,582
Kota scores again!

284
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,418
Kota leads: two-zip.

285
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:23,753
We are playing to three.

286
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,004
This could be it.

287
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,923
Next round, attacking for Kota

288
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,341
is Dan.

289
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,134
He could end this challenge.

290
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,094
Attacking for Fang is Matty,

291
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:32,720
trying to keep Fang alive for a

292
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,014
big reward.

293
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:39,268
Survivors, ready...

294
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:39,560
Go!

295
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,313
Matty comes out strong, chasing

296
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:46,651
after that ball quickly.

297
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,735
Dan very aggressive on Ace.

298
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,321
Ace gets rid of it to Crystal.

299
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,823
Crystal to Sugar, back to Ace.

300
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,367
Ace back to Sugar. No!

301
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,245
Dan causes the ball to break!

302
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:57,787
Kota scores!

303
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,039
Kota wins reward!

304
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:03,167
(excited chatter)

305
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,169
All right, Kota, big decision.

306
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,545
You're sending one member of

307
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,880
Fang to Exile Island.

308
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:08,881
>> Let's go ahead and send

309
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:09,090
Sugar.

310
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,466
>> PROBST: Sugar, this is

311
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:10,800
unprecedented.

312
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,843
I don't think we've ever had

313
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,512
anybody be sent to Exile five

314
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,847
times, back-to-back-to-back...

315
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,182
to-back-to-back.

316
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,308
>> Yeah, I'm here to break

317
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:19,850
records, you know. (laughs)

318
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,644

319
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,521
your stuff.

She is completely worthless when

322

it comes to challenges.

323
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,111
So when it comes to Sugar in

324
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,612
this game... I would really,

325
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,823
really, really desire her to go.

326

It's hard, you know, when you

333
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,336
see them walking away.

334
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:47,878
They have everything, and we

have nothing.

awesome.

It's something I thought I would

never experience, so it just

362
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:58,908
gives you more incentive, more

00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,657
It was pointless for us to even

383
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,324
keep going.

384
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,659
She was just standing there

385
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:42,159
getting walked all over.

386
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,411
I hate it.

387
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,122
I'm starting to get pissed.

388
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,498
As long as there's physical

389
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,458
challenges, we're gonna lose.

390
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,502
Want to take a boat ride, Ace?

391
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,671
>> Sure, bro.

392
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,136
>> We need to take out Sugar.

393
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:00,845
Okay, this is what we do.

394
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,681
We go Kenny, Crystal and I vote

395
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:04,140
for Sugar.

396
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,724
You don't have to vote for

397
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:06,559
Sugar, so you're not

398
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:07,435
backstabbing her, okay?

399
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,769
Sugar's gone, and it's you and I

400
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,104
to the merge a hundred percent.

401
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:10,771
There's no question.

402
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:11,313
>> You know we're a hundred

403
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,731
percent, you and me.

404
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:13,274
>> No, I don't know that.

405
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,358
We're aligned.

406
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,152
Me and you are aligned, so make

407
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:16,819
me comfortable.

408
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,738
We need to take out Sugar or at

409
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,198
least get the idol out.

410
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,039
>> Yeah, I see the logic, dude.

411
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:29,790
I see that logic.

412
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:30,875
>> Okay, we know exactly where

413
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,543
it's sitting, and we can use it

414
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:33,169
to our advantage when we have

415
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,336
to.

416
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:38,632
>> You know what they're

417
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,508
talking about, right, Cri?

418
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,593
>> Yeah, those two asses out

419
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,635
there in the boat trying to get

420
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,678
me off.

421
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,222
>> They are. Will you trust me?

422
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,515
>> I've been there with you

423
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,433
from day one, Kenny.

424
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,017
>> We have to blindside Ace.

425
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,602
>> Yeah.

426
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:50,186
>> I have to talk to Sugar.

427
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,104
Crystal, you trust me a

428
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:52,605
hundred percent, right?

429
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,105
>> I trust you a hundred

430
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,356
percent.

431
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:54,815
>> Okay.

432
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,692
>> I can feel Ace, right now,

433
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,110
strategically, wants to get rid

434
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,112
of me.

435
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,156
The way that he's manipulating

436
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,200
Matty, he's a devil.

437
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,952
And he has to go.

438
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,579
>> This is... this is awesome.

439
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,079
>> Getting this is just

440
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,247
incomparable.

441
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,665
>> And the best part about this

442
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:12,124
is they don't get it.

443
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,084
>> And they may be completely

444
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,878
out of rice, to add insult to

445
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,880
injury.

446
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,257
>> Oh, oh...

447
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,217
>> What is this?

448
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,134
>> Oh, my...

449
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,013
>> Oh, my God!

450
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:29,600
>> Wait, stop. Everyone, shh!

451
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,018
>> Holy cow, these are letters

452
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:31,852
from home.

453
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,604
>> Oh, my God, they're letters!

454
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:38,192
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

455
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,652
(gasps)

456
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,904
Oh, my God!

457
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,197
They're really letters!

458
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,911
>> (sobbing)

459
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,788
>> Bob, are you okay, man?

460
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,957
>> No, I'm not!

461
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,500
>> Your family loves you, Bob.

462
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:58,128
>> I know it. (sobbing)

463
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,838
(grunts)

464
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,799
I don't know which one to read

465
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:02,758
first.

466
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:07,388
This is from David.

467
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:07,972
>> My dad, he never writes

468
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,056
anything, and he wrote me a

469
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,808
letter.

470
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,434
>> Isn't that cool?

471
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,519
>> He never writes anything.

472
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,396
He wasn't even excited.

473
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,605
He didn't show any excitement

474
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,233
when I was leaving.

475
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,859
Wow.

476
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,027
>> "You should receive..."

477
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,237
I can't read it.

478
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,156
My eyes keep blurring.

479
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,032
I'm close to these people here,

480
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,285
but these are the people that

481
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:29,952
are the closest to my heart.

482
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,079
Life is good.

483
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,914
And I realize how lucky a man I

484
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,708
am.

485
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,334
I'm here.

486
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,002
And I can't...

487
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,753
I can't wait to get home to

488
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:40,713
them.

489
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:41,880
Life doesn't get better than

490
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:51,181
this.

491
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,683
>> Back to the Sugar Shack

492
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:53,058
for me.

493
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,727
I don't really know what the

494
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,729
hell's happening in this game.

495
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:57,980
I'm just...

496
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:01,900
trying to survive. (laughs)

497
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:02,318
Thank God for Ace.

498
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,029
What's funny is I'm pretty sure

499
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,739
we're using each other, but I

500
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,449
feel like my tribe thinks I'm

501
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,159
naive and that I'm sticking

502
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,745
with him out of stupidity, but

503
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,246
I'm sticking with him because

504
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,080
he's the strongest player at

505
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,916
this point.

506
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,044
So I just hope that they're not

507
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,253
all screwing me around.

508
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,477
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

509
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:48,030
We'll now bring in Sugar,

510
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,074
returning from Exile Island.

511
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,329
>> PROBST: All right, you guys

512
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,705
ready to get to today's

513
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,623
immunity challenge?

514
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,415
>> Yeah.

515
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,333
>> PROBST: First things first,

516
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,834
Dan, I will take it back.

517
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,294
Thank you.

518
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,299
Good news and bad news about

519
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,509
today's challenge.

520
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,387
Bad news is, both tribes are

521
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,181
going to Tribal Council tonight.

522
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,934
Both tribes are gonna vote

523
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:17,893
somebody out.

524
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:20,729
The good news, each of you will

525
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,899
have an equal shot at winning...

526
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:25,734
individual immunity.

527
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,653
It's a log roll.

528
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:28,570
You're gonna match up

529
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,655
against another tribe member.

530
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,156
It might be somebody from the

531
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,448
other tribe.

532
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,158
It might be somebody from your

533
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:33,784
own tribe.

534
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,411
Your goal is to stay on the log

535
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,078
longer than the other person.

536
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,580
First person to hit the water

537
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,707
is out.

538
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,374
Winners move on.

539
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,418
Last person left standing wins

540
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,627
immunity and is safe at

541
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,671
tonight's Tribal Council.

542
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,131
>> I think I may have a target

543
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,007
on my back, so it's very, very

544
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:49,591
important for me personally to

545
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,510
go in there and win, and not

546
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:52,636
just win by a little.

547
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,638
Win by a lot.

548
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,264
>> PROBST: In addition, there is

549
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,433
a twist which will be revealed

550
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,183
after the challenge is over.

551
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,352
>> Another twist?

552
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,353
>> PROBST: We'll draw numbers,

553
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,604
get our matchups, we'll get

554
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,147
started.

555
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,152
All right, first matchup, Dan

556
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,112
taking on Ace.

557
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,280
All right, here we go.

558
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,867
Put a foot on the log.

559
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,161
Three, two, one, walk.

560
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:21,623
We are on. First matchup.

561
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,169
Good footwork.

562
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,006
Dan is in the water.

563
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:32,050
Ace moves on to the next round!

564
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:35,179
Next round, Charlie versus

565
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,180
Crystal.

566
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:39,349
This challenge is on.

567
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,768
Charlie and Crystal looking to

568
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,436
move on.

569
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,228
Crystal in the water first.

570
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,314
Charlie moving on to the next

571
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,607
round.

572
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,234
Big matchup, Marcus versus

573
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,862
Matty.

574
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,952
Good save by Marcus.

575
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,746
Matty's in the water.

576
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:01,330
Marcus moving on to the next

577
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,041
round!

578
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,834
Randy taking on Susie.

579
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:10,881
Both from the Kota tribe.

580
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,007
Nice footwork.

581
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,134
Ah! Susie in the water first.

582
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,594
Randy moving on to the next

583
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,054
round.

584
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,890
Kenny versus Sugar.

585
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,350
Two Fang members.

586
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,976
>> This dumb thing. (laughs)

587
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,979
>> I can't even move this.

588
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:26,939
>> PROBST: Can he fight to hang

589
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:27,981
on?

590
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:28,565
No! Kenny in the water first.

591
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,026
Sugar moving on.

592
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:33,445
Last of the first rounds, Bob

593
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,489
and Corinne.

594
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,326
>> Of course he did.

595
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,327
(laughter)

596
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,370
>> PROBST: Who knew that would

597
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,329
come in handy?

598
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,331
Here we go, Bob versus Corinne.

599
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:50,796
Bob, the former log roll winner.

600
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,966
Three, two, one, walk.

601
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,181
(Bob whistling, Sugar laughing)

602
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,395
Corinne in the water first.

603
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:10,190
Bob moving on!

604
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,151
All right, semifinal round.

605
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,319
We have our matchups.

606
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,447
Charlie taking on Ace.

607
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,032
Go.

608
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:21,410
>> Come on, Charlie.

609
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,537
>> PROBST: The winner moves on

610
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,330
to the final round.

611
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,168
Ace staying alive.

612
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:34,590
Charlie's got him on the run.

613
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,216
Great match. Ace on the run.

614
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,760
Can he recover?

615
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,137
Charlie's in the water first!

616
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,639
Ace moving on to the final!

617
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,391
Very close.

618
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,852
Now it is Marcus taking on

619
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:47,060
Randy.

620
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,229
One of you will move on to the

621
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,230
final round.

622
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,232
>> Come on, Randy.

623
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,693
>> PROBST: Randy on the run.

624
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,111
Randy in the water first.

625
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:58,238
Marcus moving on to the final

626
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,240
round.

627
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,452
All right, next round, Sugar

628
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,370
versus Bob.

629
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,497
We're on.

630
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,373
Winner moves on to the final

631
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:12,461
round to join Ace and Marcus.

632
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,383
Great match.

633
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,887
Sugar not going anywhere.

634
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:26,600
Bob slips, trying to hang on.

635
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,559
Bob is back up, a great

636
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,393
recovery.

637
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,437
(Sugar screams)

638
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,022
Bob in the water first.

639
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,066
Sugar moving on.

640
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,902
>> Congratulations!

641
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:37,694
>> PROBST: The log rolling

642
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,321
champion hits the water first.

643
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,615
You'll be ridiculed back home.

644
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,867
(laughter)

645
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,285
For the final round, all three

646
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,370
of you will be on the log at

647
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,330
the same time.

648
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,539
(groaning)

649
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,917
Take your spots.

650
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,921
For the final round, Ace, we

651
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:56,922
drew for spots, you got the

652
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:57,381
middle.

653
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:00,050
You guys put a foot on the log,

654
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,094
hold it steady.

655
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,595
>> You know, I feel this win is

656
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,346
enormous, so it's important

657
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,430
that I win this challenge.

658
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,182
If I can pull it off, I'll be

659
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:08,225
proud of myself.

660
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:08,809
If not, I'll probably shoot

661
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,269
myself in the pinky toe.

662
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,647
>> PROBST: The challenge is on.

663
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,440
Three people on the log at once.

664
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:20,862
The last person on the log wins

665
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,615
immunity.

666
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:28,161
Good footwork by all three.

667
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:32,499
Sugar with a nice save.

668
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,921
Another nice save by Marcus.

669
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,050
Sugar on the run.

670
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,135
Another nice save.

671
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:43,927
Everybody still alive.

672
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,846
Sugar in the water first!

673
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,889
It's Ace and Marcus fighting

674
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,600
for immunity.

675
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,647
Great battle.

676
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,993
Ace in the water first!

677
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:11,204
Marcus wins individual immunity.

678
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,248
>> Whoo!

679
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,543
>> PROBST: Congratulations.

680
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,754
(applause)

681
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:19,838
Marcus, safe at tonight's Tribal

682
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:20,881
Council.

683
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:21,590
Now, to the twist, this is yours

684
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,508
to read.

685
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,509
Read it out loud so everybody

686
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,554
can hear it.

687
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,431
>> "You will now assign immunity

688
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,559
to one member of the other

689
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,644
tribe."

690
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,236
I'm going to give this to

691
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,863
Sugar.

692
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,365
>> PROBST: Sugar, come on over.

693
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,450
(applause)

694
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:51,828
>> My hope is that Sugar is

695
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:52,454
smart enough to keep the

696
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,749
immunity idol to herself and

697
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,501
that might actually end up

698
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,211
giving us one of our biggest

699
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,587
surprises, which would be

700
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,588
losing a big power player from

701
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,758
the Fang tribe in Ace, Matty,

702
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,510
or Crystal.

703
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:07,594
>> PROBST: Sugar safe at

704
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:08,637
tonight's Tribal Council for

705
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:08,845
Fang.

706
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,848
Marcus is safe for Kota's.

707
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,308
>> When I saw Sugar with the

708
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:14,476
immunity necklace around her

709
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,645
neck, I'm like, "Damn!

710
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,438
This girl has two idols!"

711
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,398
She is now the most powerful

712
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,484
person in this game.

713
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:38,458
>> Who would you have picked

714
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,000
from the other tribe to give

715
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,418
immunity to?

716
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,211
>> I don't know.

717
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,087
>> You don't know?

718
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,171
>> Maybe Susie.

719
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:43,797
>> Susie?

720
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,259
>> Yeah.

721
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,260
>> Yeah, you think Susie's gonna

722
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:48,635
be gone tonight?

723
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,470
>> I think that's irritating

724
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:50,679
people.

725
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:51,680
>> Oh.

726
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,890
Matty and Ace, they're

727
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,684
thinking to get rid of Crystal

728
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:56,601
and it all depends on the

729
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,020
pin-up girl, Sugar.

730
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,021
So, yeah, I will lie in this

731
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,231
game.

732
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,399
I will do everything in my

733
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:05,152
power to get her to vote with

734
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,529
me because my life and Crystal's

735
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:13,577
life rests upon her.

736
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,413
So, basically, this is honest

737
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,164
to God truth.

738
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:17,998
This is what's happening around

739
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:18,206
camp.

740
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,708
I'm not lying to you.

741
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,959
Matty goes, "We're voting out

742
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,295
Sugar next immunity challenge."

743
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,881
And then Crystal's like, "Okay."

744
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:26,798
So then when Crystal went away,

745
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:27,883
I looked at Ace, I'm like,

746
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:28,508
"Are we really voting out

747
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:28,717
Sugar?"

748
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,343
And Ace is like, "Right now

749
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,761
Sugar is really good for nothing

750
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:32,637
except for the hidden immunity

751
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:32,888
idol."

752
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,347
They think you're like

753
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,182
clueless, you're like a dumb

754
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,183
blonde or whatever.

755
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,350
Okay, and Ace thinks he has

756
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:37,934
you wrapped around his finger.

757
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,144
>> Okay.

758
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,353
I don't trust Kenny, he might

759
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,855
have been lying to me.

760
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,565
But I have been trusting the

761
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,858
biggest snake in the game so

762
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:45,817
far and I've known that.

763
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,861
So, I really don't know who to

764
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:50,197
trust at any point in this game.

765
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,532
>> Ace is like, "Well, I

766
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,242
actually got the hidden immunity

767
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,160
idol from her once, I can

768
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:55,785
probably do that and then we can

769
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,537
blindside her and then I'll have

770
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,955
the hidden immunity idol."

771
00:24:59,039 --> 00:24:59,706
And I was like, "Oh, my freaking

772
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,334
God, this guy is a snake."

773
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:02,918
>> You and I will say we're

774
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:06,630
voting on Crystal.

775
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:07,631
>> We blindside Ace.

776
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,091
>> Blindside Ace today.

777
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:10,926
>> And we don't have to worry

778
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,427
about the snake ever again.

779
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,720
>> Never again.

780
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,513
>> I trust Sugar and I trust

781
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,640
that she will go along with the

782
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,725
plan to vote out Ace.

783
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:19,935
She may be the pin-up girl, but

784
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,020
she's very smart.

785
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,742
>> Kenny has reassured me all is

786
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:36,743
well.

787
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,662
I will truly believe Sugar when

788
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,830
she writes Ace's name down.

789
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,207
Either she's going to write my

790
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:42,791
name or she's going to write

791
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:49,756
Ace's name.

792
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,800
>> Why?

793
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,518
Who's going to do that?

794
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:02,102
They'd only have two votes.

795
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:02,644
Matty's with you.

796
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,646
>> They'd have three votes.

797
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,605
>> No, it'd be Kenny and

798
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:09,317
Crystal, wouldn't it?

799
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,490
>> I gave it back to you last

800
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:16,283
time.

801
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,200
I'll give it back to you this

802
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,076
time.

803
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,869
>> Oh, Ace, I gotta think

804
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,162
about it, okay?

805
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:21,830
>> That's fine.

806
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,790
>> You make me feel awful.

807
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:27,627
When Ace asked me for the idol,

808
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,170
it made me think maybe Kenny

809
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:29,754
was telling me the truth.

810
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,048
>> Don't you think after...

811
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,591
>> Ace definitely knows how to

812
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,510
finagle people much more than

813
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:37,554
I've ever seen anybody do,

814
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:41,141
probably in my life.

815
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:42,309
But he's definitely had my back.

816
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:42,892
>> I'll bring the last of it,

817
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,477
and then that's it.

818
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:44,978
>> All right, go for it.

819
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:45,729
>> Crystal's supposed to go

820
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:49,274
next, but plans could change.

821
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,650
Ace could be turning on me now.

822
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:54,821
I have no idea.

823
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,156
Oh, God, what am I gonna do with

824
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,283
this thing?

825
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:17,844
>> PROBST: Sugar, you've been

826
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,513
out here 21 days.

827
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,014
Tell me about camp life.

828
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:21,806
What's going on?

829
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,643
>> Um, we are very low on rice.

830
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,227
Crystal accidentally knocked

831
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,729
some over, and she didn't eat

832
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,273
because she knocked it over.

833
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,358
>> PROBST: Kenny, how much rice

834
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:31,900
did you have before Crystal

835
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,818
knocked it over?

836
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:34,736
>> We had about seven days

837
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,780
worth.

838
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,156
Crystal ended up scooping some

839
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,157
of the rice that she spilled

840
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,700
outside back into the pot.

841
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,577
So, probably had about five and

842
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,454
a half days worth of rice.

843
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:45,080
>> PROBST: So, Matty, the rice

844
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,457
is so valuable, that if you

845
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,125
spill even a little in the dirt,

846
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,293
you gotta pick it out grain by

847
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,336
grain.

848
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,420
>> The rice is valuable.

849
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,421
It's the most valuable thing we

850
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:53,963
have.

851
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,006
We get about six to eight

852
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,966
spoonfuls a day of rice.

853
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:57,342
>> PROBST: Wow.

854
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:59,803
>> And she spills the rice, and

855
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,346
nobody goes, "God, Crystal,

856
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:02,472
what are you doing?!" Nobody...

857
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,556
>> No, but your faces said it

858
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,015
all.

859
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:04,891
>> Just simmer down.

860
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,142
>> Your face said it all.

861
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,018
>> My face says it all... nobody

862
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:07,435
says a word to her.

863
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,061
>> Because they knew it was an

864
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,187
accident.

865
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:09,771
>> Exactly, so just...

866
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:10,730
>> I didn't purposely go over to

867
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:11,773
the rice box and just throw the

868
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:12,440
rice down.

869
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,400
>> Just let me get to my point.

870
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,109
Can I get to my point?

871
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,276
>> Get to your point and then

872
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:15,985
I'll talk.

873
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:16,903
>> So, then we looked past it.

874
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,114
We moved past that issue.

875
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,115
>> PROBST: Ace, make sense of

876
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,199
that for me.

877
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,242
>> Crystal made a mistake.

878
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,576
That's common.

879
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,869
The whole part of us feeling

880
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:25,954
angry at her I thought was a bit

881
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,248
concocted in her own head.

882
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:29,624
>> Now I'm delusional.

883
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,126
I can see it on your face, Ace.

884
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,001
Okay, don't look at me like

885
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,044
that.

886
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,004
When Matty turned around he was

887
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:35,755
like, "Oh, whatever."

888
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:36,339
Then he made some look at you,

889
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,382
Ace.

890
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,258
I didn't say anything to

891
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,092
anybody.

892
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,718
I just sat down there picking up

893
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,387
about 20,000 grains of rice

894
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,805
and then they started to eat.

895
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,265
"Oh, Crystal, come on and eat."

896
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,891
No, I spilled some of the rice

897
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:47,892
so I will go without and

898
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:48,893
that's what I did and that's

899
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:49,227
why I did it.

900
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,521
>> Nobody asked you to, Crystal.

901
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,480
>> It's not like you saved me

902
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,274
any anyways-- you still ate it.

903
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,276
>> I asked you three times...

904
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,444
>> Yeah, I mean, if you cared

905
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,278
enough you would've saved me

906
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:02,240
some anyways.

907
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:02,866
>> PROBST: Sugar, you have,

908
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:03,867
like, the perfect seat in the

909
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:04,868
midst of this great

910
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:05,910
Shakespearean drama.

911
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:06,494
>> I know.

912
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,495
>> PROBST: Your eyes are like

913
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,246
saucers.

914
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,914
>> This sounds like such petty

915
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,666
bull crap to me.

916
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:12,792
I mean, I think that we can get

917
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,002
past our issues better than

918
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,795
this, and this is why we haven't

919
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,590
been winning, because people are

920
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:19,841
holding these stupid, petty

921
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:23,094
things against each other.

922
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,095
>> PROBST: All right, Sugar, you

923
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,305
have individual immunity

924
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,055
tonight.

925
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:26,681
You can assign that to somebody

926
00:29:26,764 --> 00:29:27,891
else or keep it for yourself.

927
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:28,892
>> Keeping it.

928
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:29,392
>> PROBST: Sugar is safe

929
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,477
tonight.

930
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,686
Everybody else is fair game.

931
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:32,645
It is time to vote.

932
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,731
Ace, you're up.

933
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,994
>> You're one of the snakes, and

934
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,204
I got to get rid of you.

935
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,289
Go home.

936
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,714
>> Crystal, I've been waiting

937
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:01,549
for this day for so long, and I

938
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,718
am so happy it's here.

939
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,565
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

940
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,651
votes.

941
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,451
If anybody has the hidden

942
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:29,661
immunity idol and you want to

943
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:30,995
play it, now would be the time

944
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,081
to do so.

945
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,338
Okay, once the votes are read,

946
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,464
the decision is final.

947
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,340
The person voted out will be

948
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,132
asked to leave the Tribal

949
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,342
Council area immediately.

950
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,427
I'll read the votes.

951
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:52,100
First vote, Ace.

952
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,019
Crystal.

953
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:59,524
One vote Ace, one vote Crystal.

954
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:00,024
Ace.

955
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:03,987
Two votes Ace, one vote Crystal.

956
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,324
We're tied.

957
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,117
Two votes Crystal, two votes

958
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,036
Ace, one vote left.

959
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,294
Seventh person voted out of

960
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,045
<i>Survivor: Gabon...</i>

961
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,590
Ace. That's three.

962
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,675
You need to bring me your torch.

963
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,686
>> PROBST: Ace, the tribe has

964
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:37,979
spoken.

965
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,023
>> Good luck, guys.

966
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,701
>> PROBST: Well, based on the

967
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:52,327
reaction from Ace, I'd say that

968
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,454
was a blindside.

969
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,539
21 days in, Fang is finally

970
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,999
starting to play this game.

971
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:58,916
Grab your torches.

972
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,126
Head back to camp.

973
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,337
Good night.

974
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,132
Don't go away.

975
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,509
Coming up next, Kota prepares

976
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,095
for their own Tribal Council.

977
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,055
>> Right now would be an

978
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,306
optimal time to get me out.

979
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,390
>> PROBST: While Dan digs his

980
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,726
own grave...

981
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,770
Susie commits social suicide.

982
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:19,520
>> I was actually going to vote

983
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,439
you.

984
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:22,857
>> Really?!

985
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,441
I hate her.

986
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,485
I want her gone, yesterday.

987
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,584
>> Can I ask you a question?

988
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,627
>> What?

989
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,753
>> I'm not going tonight, am I?

990
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,171
>> Not that I know of.

991
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:45,755
Given the fact that everyone's

992
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,340
voting for Susie.

993
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:48,424
>> It has to be Susie, 'cause

994
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,342
we have no idea.

995
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,218
We could stay together as a

996
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,094
tribe for another two rounds.

997
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,887
Right now would be an optimal

998
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,597
time to get me out as a strong

999
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,140
player so this is a huge vote

1000
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,100
for me, because I'm either going

1001
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:59,310
to come back here and trust

1002
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,228
everyone or I'm going to be at

1003
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:14,701
home eating a pizza.

1004
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:15,702
>> Please trust us.

1005
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:16,703
>> Yeah.

1006
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,204
>> And, you know...

1007
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,296
>> And-and that is incredible

1008
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,589
faith on my part, but I know I

1009
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,173
got to do it.

1010
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,217
>> Randy's replaced Bob in a

1011
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,553
final four situation, because I

1012
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:34,762
think Randy's willing to cast

1013
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,097
his lot in with a good group of

1014
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,515
people, and he's found that.

1015
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:40,435
And he, you know, as long as he

1016
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,519
keeps his end of the bargain,

1017
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,729
he's got a great run for this

1018
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:50,319
game.

1019
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,863
>> She knows she's low man on

1020
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:52,530
the totem pole.

1021
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:53,406
She's bound to.

1022
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,824
She may continue to dig her

1023
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,743
grave all day long, and-and

1024
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:57,702
y'all's conclusion may shift.

1025
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:58,494
>> Of course.

1026
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,580
>> As annoying as Bob is, I see

1027
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:01,956
him as being as loyal and

1028
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,708
trustworthy as the day is long.

1029
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,168
>> And-and right now, I can't

1030
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,003
say the same thing about Dan.

1031
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:07,962
>> I can't, either.

1032
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:08,588
>> But I'm closer being able to

1033
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,214
say it about Susie than I am

1034
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,132
about Dan.

1035
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,175
>> Dan is super vulnerable

1036
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,134
tonight.

1037
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,761
And the only thing Dan has going

1038
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,971
for him right now is that he

1039
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:17,638
should really cross his fingers

1040
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,348
that Susie's going to blow up

1041
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:22,393
and do some crazy stuff.

1042
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,773
>> I really like you, and I

1043
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,608
don't want you to go home.

1044
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,026
So I'm not writing your name

1045
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:30,651
down, and I just wanted you to

1046
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,861
know that.

1047
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,154
You're just not on my list of...

1048
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,238
>> Do you know who-who they're

1049
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,490
thinking about voting out?

1050
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,366
>> Um, I think that it's going

1051
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,910
to be Dan.

1052
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:39,911
>> That's what your-- your guess

1053
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:40,953
is it's gonna be Dan?

1054
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,038
>> I think so, yeah.

1055
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,039
But we felt like we don't want

1056
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:43,998
to take somebody that's gonna

1057
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:44,957
flip.

1058
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,042
I feel really good about the

1059
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:46,834
fact that you wouldn't.

1060
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:47,835
>> No, I wouldn't, as long as

1061
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:48,711
you keep me in the loop.

1062
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:49,837
I-I figured people were talking,

1063
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:50,880
and I figured eventually they

1064
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:51,964
would come to me and tell me

1065
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:52,924
where I'm at, you know.

1066
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:53,508
'Cause I-- when I was gonna--

1067
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,342
Okay, I'm gonna be honest with

1068
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,843
you.

1069
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:56,844
I was actually going to vote

1070
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,054
you, because...

1071
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:58,596
>> Why?

1072
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,222
>> Because I know that I'm a

1073
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,765
hard worker.

1074
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:01,349
I-I know that without having

1075
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:04,018
fire and water and food, how are

1076
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:05,061
you going to perform physically?

1077
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,062
You're going to have to take

1078
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,063
that time to do that work.

1079
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:07,355
>> Mm-hmm.

1080
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,397
>> So I'm just being totally up

1081
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,398
front with you, so, and

1082
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:09,816
that's the truth.

1083
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:10,441
>> Okay, so you need me to help

1084
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,818
more.

1085
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:12,819
>> Well, yeah, I need help from

1086
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:13,820
everybody, actually.

1087
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:14,821
So that's where I'm at.

1088
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:15,822
But I-I appreciate that, 'cause

1089
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:16,781
now I know which way I can

1090
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,240
swing.

1091
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:19,742
>> So this moron has decided

1092
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:22,245
that she'd like me to go.

1093
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:23,246
Really?!

1094
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,330
I hate her.

1095
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,999
I hate her, hate her, hate her.

1096
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:27,625
Like, I really want to stab her

1097
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:28,918
in the face.

1098
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,795
And if you piss me off, you've

1099
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:31,379
pissed off my alliance.

1100
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,718
>> Did I not say to you guys

1101
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:38,427
she's nuts?

1102
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:39,637
I mean, certifiable.

1103
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,721
>> But she's the worst kind of

1104
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:41,597
nuts, 'cause you don't see it

1105
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:41,848
coming.

1106
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,391
>> She goes whichever way the

1107
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:43,724
wind is blowing.

1108
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,267
>> Um, I mean, I hate her.

1109
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,728
I want her gone, yesterday.

1110
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,898
>> Susie's game is no game.

1111
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,900
And the problem with no game is

1112
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,111
her vote can be bought.

1113
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:55,945
She's gone.

1114
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,029
>> Tonight, I don't want any

1115
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:57,613
sort of curveball.

1116
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,656
I do not want to go home

1117
00:35:58,739 --> 00:35:59,198
tonight.

1118
00:35:59,282 --> 00:35:59,740
I don't know what could be

1119
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,242
cooking.

1120
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:01,784
I mean, Dan doesn't have the

1121
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,995
idol, does he?

1122
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:04,954
>> Not that I know of.

1123
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:05,955
>> What if Susie and Dan get

1124
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:06,873
together, Dan has the idol,

1125
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:07,790
and he's like, "Let's both

1126
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,042
vote Corinne"?

1127
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:10,459
>> Then you're gone.

1128
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,336
>> Let's just take her out.

1129
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,337
Then she has to go.

1130
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,589
>> Everybody's ass is on the

1131
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:14,755
line.

1132
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:15,339
Susie needs to go.

1133
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,257
She's annoying.

1134
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,343
I want her to go home, and soon.

1135
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:23,139
>> So, um, here's the thing.

1136
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,224
My entire plan was wedged on the

1137
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,476
fact that Susie is easy, she

1138
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,519
trusts us, and she's never

1139
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,103
gonna win individual immunity.

1140
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:30,479
We can get rid of her when we

1141
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:30,688
want.

1142
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,982
I didn't realize she was<i> loco</i>

1143
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:33,524
<i>en la cabeza.</i>

1144
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,109
Like, I had no idea that that

1145
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:36,027
was what I was dealing with.

1146
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,904
>> I am devastated right now.

1147
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:38,821
>> Well, I'm completely

1148
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,114
frustrated, because I feel like

1149
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:40,740
we got some issues that we had

1150
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:41,824
no idea existed.

1151
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:42,825
>> What do you think is the

1152
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:43,117
safer bet?

1153
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,160
'Cause I'm really a little

1154
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,119
concerned.

1155
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:46,203
>> We're at the point where

1156
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,455
I think either decision has

1157
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,247
incredible risks associated

1158
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:48,998
with it.

1159
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:49,540
>> Right.

1160
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,333
>> Thank God we have a

1161
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,334
two-person advantage at this

1162
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,210
point.

1163
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,628
But Dan could have the

1164
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,338
immunity idol.

1165
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,757
But I really doubt it, so--

1166
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,758
If he actually does have the

1167
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,009
immunity idol, we should vote

1168
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:00,593
out Susie.

1169
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:00,801
>> Yeah.

1170
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,469
>> Just in case there's an idol.

1171
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,304
>> Yeah.

1172
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,139
We're worried that Dan has the

1173
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:06,766
immunity idol, because he spent

1174
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,517
a couple days on Exile Island.

1175
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:09,477
But we also think that Dan may

1176
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,519
need to go.

1177
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,271
So unfortunately, it's not who

1178
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,522
is the best asset.

1179
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,441
It's who is the least risky.

1180
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,777
Which stinks because, you know,

1181
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,986
we still don't know who we're

1182
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,155
gonna be better off with.

1183
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,467
>> PROBST: Marcus, is the game

1184
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,510
at a point where you're now

1185
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:43,344
looking out for yourself versus

1186
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,763
keeping our tribe strong?

1187
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:46,764
>> I think we're basing our

1188
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,182
decision on what we're

1189
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:48,766
expecting to come in the next

1190
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:49,433
few days.

1191
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,435
We've got to surround ourselves

1192
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,020
with the most powerful crowd of

1193
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,313
people, because that's the only

1194
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,023
way we're going to survive an

1195
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,316
onslaught from the rest of the

1196
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,567
Fang tribe.

1197
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,652
>> PROBST: Susie, looking at

1198
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,612
this tribe, you got to be a

1199
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,114
little concerned yourself.

1200
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:03,698
Is it fair to say that you're

1201
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,366
the weakest person on this

1202
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,409
tribe in challenges?

1203
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:07,493
>> I-I don't think I am.

1204
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:08,577
I think there's certain skills

1205
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:09,787
that I may be a little bit

1206
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,496
weaker at, but...

1207
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,872
>> PROBST: Who's weaker than

1208
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,207
you on this tribe?

1209
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,209
>> Um, I think strength-wise,

1210
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:16,127
upper strength, I think I'm

1211
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,545
stronger than Corinne.

1212
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,546
>> PROBST: Corinne not buying

1213
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,338
that at all.

1214
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:20,464
>> I don't want to insult her.

1215
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,757
I think that she is very

1216
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:22,883
skilled, and I think that she

1217
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,301
does have athletic talent, you

1218
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:24,719
know.

1219
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:25,636
>> PROBST: She just insulted

1220
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,303
you.

1221
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,555
>> Well, yes, and that's why I'm

1222
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,347
telling you that I don't agree.

1223
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,348
I think that I have a lot to

1224
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,766
offer.

1225
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:31,767
I think I have upper body

1226
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:32,393
strength.

1227
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,519
I think I've got a lot of

1228
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,186
things, but...

1229
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:34,770
>> And you probably do.

1230
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,313
I don't-- I mean, I'm just, I'm

1231
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,523
trying to just kind of observe

1232
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:38,983
and just kind of see where this

1233
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:39,859
game's taking me, and...

1234
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:40,526
>> PROBST: Corinne, have you

1235
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,445
picked up on Susie's tendencies

1236
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,404
to maybe sometimes let loose?

1237
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,073
>> Yeah, but I've operated

1238
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,241
without a filter for so many

1239
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:48,743
years that, like, I totally

1240
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,535
respect when people come out of

1241
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:50,411
their shell and just say

1242
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,246
whatever it is that they're

1243
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:52,872
thinking.

1244
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,123
I mean, I would encourage more

1245
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:54,582
of that.

1246
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,624
Maybe you should blow up once

1247
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:56,667
in a while, and then I'll know

1248
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:57,418
you better.

1249
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,461
>> PROBST: Randy, where do you

1250
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,881
sit on the "be yourself" versus

1251
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,132
"hold it in"?

1252
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,468
>> I'm probably about eight on a

1253
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,344
scale of ten, and that's good

1254
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:07,595
and bad.

1255
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,638
>> PROBST: What's good about it?

1256
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:10,473
>> I don't have to pretend.

1257
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:13,851
And, uh, you know, people pretty

1258
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,311
much know where I stand most of

1259
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:15,978
the time.

1260
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:16,937
>> PROBST: What's bad about it?

1261
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,939
>> I don't have to pretend, and

1262
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:19,523
people know where I stand most

1263
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:20,816
of the time.

1264
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,276
(laughter)

1265
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:23,277
>> PROBST: Dan, where do you fit

1266
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,278
in on that?

1267
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:25,362
>> Um, I tend to be a

1268
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,531
worrywart, and so it has

1269
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,700
inhibited me from being

1270
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:30,868
completely comfortable and

1271
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:31,452
completely myself.

1272
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,579
But my result in the game will

1273
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:36,582
fare much better if I can shake

1274
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:37,416
it off and just relax.

1275
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,251
>> PROBST: Charlie, how big a

1276
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,753
factor is trust becoming?

1277
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,838
21 days in for this group of

1278
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:43,506
seven.

1279
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:44,632
>> It's huge, because we intend

1280
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,093
to go into a merge as a

1281
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,719
powerful group together.

1282
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,638
And if someone splinters, our

1283
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,306
numbers will dwindle before the

1284
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:53,432
Fang numbers dwindle.

1285
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:54,475
So my vote is based on who I can

1286
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,561
trust going into a merge most.

1287
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,188
>> PROBST: Corinne, is it

1288
00:39:59,271 --> 00:39:59,772
possible that tonight's vote

1289
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:02,441
could be a mistake?

1290
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:02,775
>> Damn, yeah.

1291
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,860
I don't know if we're making

1292
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,028
the right decision or if I

1293
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,029
personally am making the right

1294
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:07,780
decision.

1295
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:08,572
I hope that I am.

1296
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,324
>> PROBST: All right, let's get

1297
00:40:10,407 --> 00:40:10,950
to the vote.

1298
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:11,909
Marcus, thanks to a nice

1299
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,285
performance today, you have

1300
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:13,702
individual immunity.

1301
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,454
It is yours unless you choose

1302
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,747
to give it to somebody else.

1303
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,124
>> We won it for Kota, but I'm

1304
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:18,707
going to hang on to this one.

1305
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,334
>> PROBST: All right, you cannot

1306
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:21,043
vote for Marcus.

1307
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,419
Everybody else is fair game.

1308
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,212
It is time to vote.

1309
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,588
Bob, you're up.

1310
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,474
>> Dan.

1311
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:36,767
Sorry, guy.

1312
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,443
>> Susie, you have a, uh, a

1313
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,445
great heart, and I'm going to

1314
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,864
vote with what I think the rest

1315
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,949
of the tribe is voting.

1316
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,379

If anybody has the hidden

00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:26,734
immunity idol and you want to

1321
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,320
play it, now would be the time

to do so.

1323
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:34,909

Dan.

1346
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:25,709
Need to bring me your torch.

1347
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,888
Dan, the tribe has spoken.

1348
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,725
It's time for you to go.

1349
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,061

>> PROBST: Well, despite being

1351
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,282
very successful, this is not

1352
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,324
one big, happy family.

1353
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,909
Grab your torches, head back to

1354
00:42:58,993 --> 00:42:59,535
camp.

1355
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,412

<i>Survivor...</i>

There's a new leader in Africa.

1366
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,311
And they call him Randy.

>> I am king of Gabon.

1368
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,897
I'm sorry, but I rule.

1369
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:29,690
This ocean, it's mine.

1370
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,859
All those Fang and Kota

1371
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,486
members, they know the power is

1372
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,237
shifting.

1373
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,447
I'm king.

1374
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,114
Cheers.

1375
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:38,490
>> Whoo!

1376
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,956
>> This pretty much blows.

1377
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,166
There's a definite level of

1378
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:48,459
disappointment in relation to

1379
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:49,084
Sugar.

1380
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:49,710
Matty, I respect you, you know.

1381
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:50,753
I wish you the best.

1382
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:51,795
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

1383
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,673
>> Um, a lot of mixed feelings

1384
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:55,341
right now.

1385
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:56,300
A little bit disappointed that

1386
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:57,509
I didn't make it further in the

1387
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:57,885
game.

1388
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:58,844
On the other hand, it feels

1389
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,137
good to be able to be myself.

1390
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,263
And I got some great friends and

1391

family to go back to, so that's
