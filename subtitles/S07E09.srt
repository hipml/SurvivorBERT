00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,921
<i>Survivor:</i>
In a special Outcast Tribal

3
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:09,426
Council, Burton and Lill were
voted back into the game.

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,261
Grab your torches.
Get fire.

5
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,596
(thunderclap)
Burton returned to the Drake

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,223
Tribe.
>> Welcome back, Burton.

7
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:19,561
>> Welcome back.
>> We definitely traded up.

8
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:22,272
>> PROBST: Lill returned to
Morgan, still feeling

9
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,649
vulnerable.
>> I just didn't feel like

10
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:28,695
part of a group.
I just didn't fit in.

11
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:31,114
>> I don't think she trusts me
at all because I was partially

12
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,950
responsible for voting her out.
>> PROBST: When the tribes

13
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:36,453
arrived for the challenge,
they were surprised once again.

14
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,121
Drop your buffs.
>> Oh, my God!

15
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,290
>> PROBST: This time with the
merge-- Drake is no more.

16
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,792
Morgan is no more.
You are one tribe.

17
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,753
Survivors ready?
Go!

18
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:48,923
The first individual immunity
challenge was a close race

19
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,426
between Rupert and Burton,
but in the end...

20
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:54,220
Burton wins immunity!
(chuckling)

21
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,306
The new Balboa Tribe enjoyed
a feast.

22
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,932
>> To Balboa!
>> Balboa!

23
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,976
>> PROBST: But the camaraderie
didn't last.

24
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,853
>> We need to figure out
who goes first.

25
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,813
I can't stand Little Jon.
He's arrogant.

26
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,107
He's out for himself,
and we would love to see him go.

27
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:09,277
>> PROBST: And Lill considered
an offer from the former Drakes.

28
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,324
>> They're all offering
friendship.

29
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:17,660
Whether or not I can trust
all this, I can't really say.

30
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,122
>> If Lill goes to the bad guys,
we're in serious trouble.

31
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,958
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,
Burton gave immunity to Rupert.

32
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:27,879
And Lill turned on her former
Morgan Tribe when she helped

33
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:32,717
vote Andrew out of the game.
The tribe has spoken.

34
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:37,472
Nine are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?

It's like the difference
between night and day.

41
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,438
I turned on my, uh,
Morgan Tribe.

42
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,524
I... I had no reason
to stay with them.

43
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,611
I would have been voted off
with another:

44
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,572
"She's got great work ethic.
She's really nice lady,

45
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:22,785
but see you around."
And usually, I have regrets

46
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:27,290
stabbing someone in the back,
but this time,

47
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,584
I feel like I stood up
for myself.

48
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:36,466
You know, I was no longer...
the Cincinnati workhorse.

49
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:41,262
You know, I was Lill.
It was just nice.

50
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,182
I have blossomed more
in the last two days

51
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:50,480
with just a hug or a kind word.
Whatever you guys decide,

52
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,815
I'm with the team.
>> You'll be the last Morgan

53
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,569
in it because you're a Drake.
And if you can win that

54
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,655
immunity, I'll put a Drake out
before you.

55
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:02,116
>> Be serious.
(laughing)

56
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,119
>> Don't be, don't...
don't do that to yourself.

57
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,080
You stood up...
You were the lion and you stood

58
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:10,166
up to Savage.
Stand up to anything.

59
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:13,336
Don't give up.
>> No, I'm not going to.

60
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:22,345
(distant thunder rolling)
>> Tribal Council for me sucked

61
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,682
last night because Lill decided
she was going to switch

62
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,351
to the other tribe because she's
pissed off at Andrew.

63
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,187
Me and Andrew had a tight bond
straight from the beginning.

64
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,191
And it was... it was cool.
I was bummed to see him go.

65
00:04:35,274 --> 00:04:37,694
So, I'm basically next
on the chopping block,

66
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:47,787
and, uh, it sucks.
>> I don't know.

67
00:04:47,870 --> 00:05:03,344
and, uh, it sucks.
>> I don't know.

68
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,389
>> You know the four of them are
tight.

69
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,058
>> Yeah.
>> I mean, Rupert-Rupert sees

70
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,519
you as a threat, so...
>> You just got to just watch

71
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:14,272
out, dude, because you're on
the chopping block pretty soon.

72
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,357
>> Yeah.
I had talked to Burton

73
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,901
this morning to feel out how
he was feeling about the Drake

74
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,111
Tribe.
I go, "Hey, man, they voted you

75
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,947
out before.
What makes you think, you know,

76
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,907
after I'm gone,
you're not the next to go

77
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,784
because you're the next
strongest person?"

78
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,579
Well, I mean, if you want,
if I could get the two girls,

79
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,248
and if you could get Lill,
you know, we could kind of

80
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:34,083
control our own destiny,
if you feel comfortable

81
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,252
with that.
>> Yeah.

82
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:40,757
Ryan's trying to convince me
that Rupert, Sandra, Christa,

83
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,969
and Jon are a very tight group
of four, and they will vote me

84
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,929
out.
I know they still have

85
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,599
some hesitations about me
because they know I want to win

86
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,309
this game.
What he's saying is,

87
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,437
he could get himself,
Darrah and Tijuana.

88
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,523
If I could get Lill, we'd have
five, and we could run them out

89
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,609
and then go from there.
>> I don't know how close you

90
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,070
are with Jon or any of those
guys, but, I mean, I know

91
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,488
they voted for you.
>> Yeah.

92
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,281
>> You know what I mean?
>> Yeah. No, I-I definitely

93
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:08,326
hear what you're saying.
At this point in the game,

94
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,787
there's a lot of things
going on, and there's a lot of

95
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,790
possibilities of where the game
could go.

96
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,627
>> Just... Just think about it
because...

97
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,505
they voted you out once,
and they welcomed you back,

98
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,466
but then again, you know,
we welcomed Lill back,

99
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:33,518
and look what she did to us.
>> Ow.

100
00:06:33,601 --> 00:07:13,808
and look what she did to us.
>> Ow.

101
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:17,186
These things don't have electric
stuff in them, do they?

102
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,271
>> Uh-uh.
There is an ele...

103
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:21,190
>> Are you sure, dude?
Come up and stick your finger

104
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,359
in here.
So, I went out to get a stingray

105
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:26,195
and actually took the stingray
off the spear while it was still

106
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,197
alive, and was holding it...
Stick your finger...

107
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,491
your...
No, in those holes.

108
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,535
Well, now you're freaking me
out.

109
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,911
(laughs)
>> Wow!

110
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,372
It's an electric ray.
>> Oh, my God.

111
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:38,916
>> Is it really?
>> I kept trying to hold it

112
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,877
down, and it kept shocking me,
so, it-it's some type

113
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,421
of electric stingray,
(laughs): but it let out

114
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,214
a pretty good charge
a number of times.

115
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,841
Stick your finger back in there,
dude.

116
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,093
>> I don't want to stick my
finger back in there.

117
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,761
I don't think...
>> (screams)

118
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,388
>> Ow! God, that one got me
good.

119
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:54,182
(laughing)
Son of a bitch, dude.

120
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,851
>> Oh, my God, we're eating
stingray.

121
00:07:56,934 --> 00:08:00,062
>> Shockingly good.
>> It's shockingly good.

122
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,733
>> Mm-hmm.
>> Yes, sir.

123
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:07,320
That's a high-voltage meal.
>> Mm-hmm. Very good.

124
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:11,574
>> Mm, yeah, I like it.
(laughter)

125
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:15,411
Food, food, food.
Everything is nice over here.

126
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:16,996
>> Take that.
>> No. You eat it.

127
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,539
>> Take that.
>> I'm good, really.

128
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,042
Seriously, I'm good. Thank you.
>> Okay.

129
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,877
>> Um, they have food all the
time.

130
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,046
It's just... it's so not where
I come from.

131
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,924
They've got it going well.
They've got great food.

132
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,259
Rupert does a lot of fishing
and hunting.

133
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,930
Burton-- he caught the stingray.
So, it's very exciting for me.

134
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,390
Very exciting.
>> Take your pick.

135
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,601
Grab one.
Whichever.

136
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,770
Gut it and scale it,
and we'll filet it.

137
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:45,650
I hope that all of the former
Morgans, now Balboas,

138
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,569
feel comfortable enough to eat
as much as they want.

139
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,280
>> Mmm.
>> There is always meat in the

140
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:55,117
cheeks.
I like that feeling of being

141
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,954
able to fill you up
and make you feel comfortable.

142
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,747
I mean, I'm looking
at these guys.

143
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,624
Their body...
They're just emaciated from lack

144
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:07,129
of food.
It's sad.

145
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:31,153
>> PROBST: Welcome to your first
individual reward challenge.

146
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,989
It's pretty simple.
Here's how it works.

147
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,284
You're gonna use slingshots
to fire marbles at targets

148
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,995
on your mast.
Each time you hit a target,

149
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,497
it ignites the next target.
First person to hit all three

150
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,043
targets and ignite the crow's
nest of your mast wins.

151
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:49,630
We'll work in groups of three.
Three people in each round.

152
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,465
The winners from each round move
on to the final.

153
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,969
You have to hit your targets
in order, from bottom to top.

154
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,555
If you hit a target out of
order, you're out of the game.

155
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,682
Make sense?
Want to know what you're playing

156
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,683
for?
>> Yeah.

157
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,393
>> Definitely.
>> PROBST: Something you haven't

158
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,688
had in a long time: breakfast.
Here's a little tease.

159
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,065
(women sighing)
>> PROBST: One very small

160
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,359
sweet roll.
Burton, I'll start with you.

161
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,361
You can figure out
how to deal with it.

162
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,156
So your reward will be
everything that comes

163
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,742
with a good breakfast:
pancakes and syrup,

164
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:21,412
bacon and eggs,
lots of croissant, jam,

165
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,874
plenty of sweet rolls,
big old pitcher of orange juice,

166
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,918
nice scenery...
a little break from the game.

167
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,545
Boat'll pick you up
in the morning.

168
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:31,714
Worth playing for?
>> Hell, yeah.

169
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,883
>> PROBST: All right, we'll draw
numbers to figure out your

170
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:37,511
positions.
Wait for my go.

171
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,722
Okay, we've randomly
drawn numbers.

172
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,849
First three, come up,
take your spots.

173
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:45,227
Sandra, Ryno and Darrah.
Winner of this round will

174
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,563
move on to the final.
First shots.

175
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:53,027
Ready, aim, fire.
There it is.

176
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,446
(cheering)
Sandra connects.

177
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,156
>> And I hit myself
in the mouth, too.

178
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,783
I'm a come out of here
with a busted lip.

179
00:10:58,866 --> 00:10:59,784
>> PROBST: Hits her first
target.

180
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:04,205
>> I want pancakes.
>> PROBST: Ready, aim, fire.

181
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:07,917
Ryno knocked it off.
That'll work.

182
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,590
Ryno and Sandra on the board.
Ready, aim, fire.

183
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,092
>> Oh, man!
>> You cracked it,

184
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,637
but it didn't break.
>> PROBST: Ready, aim, fire.

185
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,431
Sandra!
(cheering)

186
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:26,894
Busts hers.
Sandra connects again.

187
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,771
Ryno still can't get
that plate to break.

188
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:35,277
Ready, aim, fire.
There it is for Ryno.

189
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,948
>> Oh, hell.
>> PROBST: Ready, aim, fire.

190
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,993
Oh, Ryno moving on
to the next round.

191
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,454
Next three, come on up.
Burton, Rupert and Jon.

192
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,624
Ryno's already moved into the
the final.

193
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,584
Which one of you three
will join him?

194
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:55,089
Ready, aim, fire.
Rupert connects.

195
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,590
(clapping)
>> You go, boy.

196
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,676
Right away he's on the board.
>> PROBST: Here we go.

197
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:02,930
Ready, aim, fire.
Rupert connects.

198
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:06,809
Jon hits out of order.
Jon's out of the game.

199
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,186
Have a seat.
One more challenge Jon cannot

200
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,772
finish.
(laughing)

201
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,732
>> We still love you though,
buddy.

202
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,985
>> PROBST: Rupert quickly on the
board with two plates,

203
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,779
only needs one more target
to move on to the final.

204
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:23,659
Got some work cut out, Burton.
Ready, aim, fire.

205
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:27,455
Rupert with three shots does it,
moves on to the final.

206
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,206
(clapping)
No contest.

207
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,959
Next three:
T., Lill and Christa.

208
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,171
Looking for one person to join
Rupert and Ryno in the final.

209
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:41,719
Ready, aim, fire.
>> Oh! What was that?

210
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,138
>> PROBST: Christa, you're going
to have no chance with that

211
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:50,728
form.
Ready, aim, fire.

212
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,855
T connects.
She's on the board.

213
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,608
Oh, man!
Hits her name.

214
00:12:55,691 --> 00:13:02,406
She's gonna kill somebody.
Ready, aim, fire.

215
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,534
There it is, Lill.
>> Go, Lill.

216
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,828
>> Thank you, Lord.
>> PROBST: Lill and T on the

217
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:13,792
board with one.
Ready, aim, fire.

218
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:18,130
T hit it, wasn't enough.
Lillian hit it, not enough.

219
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,425
It's close.
Give it a kick.

220
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,885
Wind may help.
(screaming)

221
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:32,686
There it goes.
Ready, aim, fire.

222
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,190
Oh, man, T., you are
destroying that plate.

223
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,776
>> But not in the right place.
>> PROBST: Third time's the

224
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:44,281
charm.
Ready, aim, fire.

225
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:48,911
There it goes!
T with her second target.

226
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,248
We got a showdown: Lill and T
both need one more hit.

227
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:56,377
Ready, aim, fire.
Lill does it!

228
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,755
Lill moves on to the final.
>> Good job, Lill.

229
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,465
Cincinnati represented.
>> PROBST: All right,

230
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:05,427
three finalists come on up.
Ryno, Lill, Rupert.

231
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,888
Final round:
winner moves on for breakfast.

232
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:12,810
Ready, aim, fire.
Lill first on the board.

233
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,813
Good job, Lill.
Who'd have thought?

234
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:23,779
Ready, aim, fire.
Lill hits her second target.

235
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:25,739
>> Oh, baby!
>> PROBST: Lill, one target away

236
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:32,746
from breakfast tomorrow morning.
Ready, aim, fire.

237
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,165
Rupert on the board
with his first hit.

238
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:39,628
>> Good job, Rupert.
>> PROBST: Ready, aim, fire.

239
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:45,050
Rupert with his second target.
Rupert and Lill in a showdown.

240
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:49,471
>> It's all good, baby.
>> PROBST: Ready, aim, fire.

241
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,516
Rupert connects!
Rupert wins reward!

242
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,602
>> Congratulations!
>> Good job, Rupert.

243
00:14:54,685 --> 00:15:00,983
Good job.
>> PROBST: Nice job, Rupert.

244
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,068
Here's the deal.
Breakfast alone is no fun at

245
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,987
all.
>> Right.

246
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,114
>> PROBST: You can choose
somebody to go with you tomorrow

247
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:10,284
morning; boat'll come to camp,
pick you up, take you somewhere

248
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,328
far away.
Get away from the game,

249
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,955
have a nice breakfast.
Or, if you like, you can give

250
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,791
your breakfast to somebody else.
Let them choose someone

251
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,168
to go with them.
>> Go.

252
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,711
>> PROBST: Your choice.
>> Give it away.

253
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,212
Give it away, Rupert.
>> Don't do it, Rupert.

254
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,174
>> Got to give that away.
>> Burton gave me the immunity

255
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,676
last night.
I'll give him the breakfast.

256
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,845
>> No, dude, I was kidding.
>> PROBST: Burton, come up

257
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:31,680
front.
Rupert, you're going in the

258
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,681
back.
Burton, you're going to

259
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,516
breakfast and you're taking
somebody with you.

260
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,560
You cannot take Rupert.
He gave it up.

261
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,438
Who's going?
>> Take Lill.

262
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,857
>> Lill.
>> PROBST: Burton and Lill going

263
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,026
to breakfast in the morning.
Boat'll pick you up.

264
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,529
Have a good time.
>> I have no money to give you.

265
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:51,408
>> PROBST: Guys, head on
back to camp.

266
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:13,847
>> Voted out of the game by your
tribe and then voted back into

267
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,350
the same tribe has been
interesting.

268
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:19,103
I am doing my best to act
like, "Hey, I'm Drake.

269
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:24,942
I'm Drake. I'm Drake."
That's a bunch of... lies.

270
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,194
I want to win this game for the
Outcast Tribe and those of us

271
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,030
who got kicked out,
so I sort of think about it as,

272
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,324
as far as my actions,
I have no loyalty

273
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,868
whatsoever to Drake.
Either I really slept late

274
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:38,914
or everybody got up early.
Nor do I have any loyalty

275
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:41,583
to Christa, Sandra or Rupert
because I know they would all

276
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,086
stab me in the back
the second they got a chance.

277
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,089
>> I love you.
>> I love you, too, baby.

278
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:51,635
>> Thank you.
>> We cannot beat Rupert,

279
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,180
Sandra or Christa, and we cannot
even separate them.

280
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,099
No one can.
>> Yep.

281
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,309
>> For that reason alone,
it might be worth taking Rupert

282
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,271
out.
>> We're crazy if we don't.

283
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,981
I mean, that's...
that's numbers, man.

284
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,233
>> Would you tell Rupert before
or just blindside him?

285
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,943
>> Think we'd have
to blindside him.

286
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:10,529
What do you think?
>> I'm just afraid if we

287
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,990
told him, he would lose it.
I know he would.

288
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,617
>> It's not hard for me
to align with anybody that

289
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,579
I know is going to help me.
Burton knows how devious I am.

290
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,956
Therefore he feels I'd be
the perfect person to go,

291
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,084
go along with his plan with him.
He was exactly right.

292
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,879
He's definitely my strongest
ally remaining in the game,

293
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:30,299
and that's the guy that I helped
see get out of the game,

294
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,176
so that's pretty funny.
Irony, uh...

295
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:37,848
irony definitely plays
a strong hand in this game.

296
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,017
>> Rupert, Sandra and Christa
will get rid of everyone.

297
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,935
Those three will go
to the final three

298
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,313
and will not take anyone else.
>> Who?

299
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,149
>> Rupert, Christa and Sandra.
>> So we got to get rid

300
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,818
of one of them.
>> We got to get rid of all of

301
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,112
them.
>> Oh, heck, I'm looking

302
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,031
forward to this breakfast, yes.
I'm anxious, uh...

303
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:57,034
I'm anxious to talk more than
eat.

304
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,828
Oh, I'm gonna eat, but, you
know, I'm anxious to talk,

305
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,581
'cause I need to know
what's going on.

306
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,918
Oh, baby!
Oh, baby, oh.

307
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:34,863
♪ ♪
>> Oh, my gosh, look at this.

308
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,909
This is so beautiful.
Whoo!

309
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:44,832
We came to this place that was
just rock and sand.

310
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,750
There was no green...
nothing.

311
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:50,712
(gasps)
Oh, my gosh!

312
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,715
And on top of the sand
was this gazebo,

313
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:58,053
and it was beautiful.
Look at these flowers.

314
00:18:58,136 --> 00:19:01,056
>> Oh, my Lord.
This buffet was just

315
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:03,225
out of control.
I mean, things that we haven't

316
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,687
even seen for, you know,
three weeks now.

317
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,398
Oh.
I'm going to get sick as a dog.

318
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,526
>> Look at the bacon, okay?
Rupert.

319
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,279
>> That's for Rupert.
>> Mm.

320
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:19,616
>> This is ridiculous.
>> Blackberries.

321
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,411
(chuckles)
Well, I say we get started.

322
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,121
>> Okay.
They had...

323
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:27,875
eggs, pancakes,
bacon, and sausage.

324
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,420
(gasps)
Oh, my gosh.

325
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,881
(gasps)
Apple juice, I want apple juice.

326
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:34,715
>> You don't drink champagne?
>> No.

327
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,425
>> God, I'm gonna blow this
thing out.

328
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,635
Well, I'm gonna watch you.
Well, I'm not much

329
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,762
on the drinking part.
Now, the young man

330
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,806
that I was with, Burton,
his eyes get real big.

331
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,226
Why do you do that?
>> It should explode.

332
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,770
>> So, I said, "Okay, I'll drink
the apple juice, and you can

333
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,732
drink the champagne."
To the Drake Tribe-- oh!

334
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:54,234
How cool is that?
>> To the Outcasts.

335
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,569
>> To the Outcasts.
>> Taking it home.

336
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,779
>> Mm-hmm.
As the Outcasts, Burton and I,

337
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:02,784
we were going to form a bond.
We have a strong alliance there.

338
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,745
I have to believe this young
man.

339
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,623
And I'm going to put everything
that I have into what he wants

340
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,167
me to do.
>> Here's the deal: we've got

341
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,920
to get Rupert off right now.
He's the mastermind behind

342
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,839
everything, and he has those two
girls in his back pocket

343
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,132
like there's no tomorrow.
>> Okay.

344
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:20,802
>> If you get Tijuana and Darrah
to vote against Rupert, do you

345
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,555
think Tijuana would...
Tijuana would jump, if it was a

346
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,099
matter of staying three more...
>> I think either girl would.

347
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,518
>> And if Rupert does win
immunity, we have to get rid of

348
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,312
Christa, and then Rupert'll
be scrambling.

349
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,940
My relationship with Lill
is that we experienced

350
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,650
the same thing.
We both got kicked out;

351
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,486
we're both back in the game.
So she's kind of my trump card

352
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,696
right now.
Okay, so, you need to make

353
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,990
friends with Christa and say,
"Listen, I'm going along with

354
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,493
whatever you guys want.
Let me know how you want me to

355
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,453
vote, and I'll continue to vote
that way."

356
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,956
>> See, now it's starting to lie
and I'm gonna have a problem

357
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,209
with that...
I know, I know, I know, I know!

358
00:20:58,632 --> 00:20:59,800
>> Are you ready for
conditioner?

359
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:04,930
>> Sure.
Rinse good.

360
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,307
>> So, you're saying
that it's possible for me, you,

361
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,518
and Lill to get rid
of Rupert and Burton.

362
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,104
>> Sandra and I were scheming
about how we might be able

363
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:15,190
to get rid of Rupert
from, uh, this game...

364
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:17,067
also Burton.
They're both very strong

365
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,903
competitors.
I have a feeling if we don't

366
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:24,282
do it earlier on, then...
there's a problem, you know?

367
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,910
'Cause they're still the
strongest people out here,

368
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,328
you know?
>> Mm-hmm.

369
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,913
Okay, let your hair stay
with this conditioner.

370
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:33,208
>> Burton's got to go first.
I mean, he's definitely

371
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,044
the stronger of the two
in the long run.

372
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,715
>> What if we got rid of Burton
and kept the two females around?

373
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,217
And then we'd still be
us five girls.

374
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,054
>> Maybe the girls are the
better people to keep around.

375
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,057
We got to orchestrate this well.
>> Me and Christa definitely do

376
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,394
feel vulnerable,
because Burton and Rupert

377
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,563
are the only ones
that bring anything

378
00:21:54,646 --> 00:22:01,862
from in the ocean to us to eat--
fish, stingray, whatever.

379
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:05,282
>> All right, girls.
let's go find us a meal,

380
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:09,411
so we can survive, maybe,
on this island without any men.

381
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:13,540
(laughs)
>> Is that the goal?

382
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,751
>> Follow, Christa.
>> Why-- you want to come along?

383
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,794
>> Me?
>> Yep.

384
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,756
>> When I see Sandra and Christa
together,

385
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,466
you hear them--
all the time-- talk about,

386
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,926
"We need to figure out
how we're going to survive

387
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,553
without fish."
Um... "If we...

388
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:31,558
if one of the guys get hurt..."
um, "then we need to figure out

389
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:35,645
how we're going to survive here.
I thought the former Drake Tribe

390
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,231
members were like this.
Um, but, obviously,

391
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:41,985
that may not be the case.
>> Lill, I like you, and you

392
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,071
and I are in this together
and we're going to get

393
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,531
as far as we can.
And you've got my word on it.

394
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,784
Who do we want the top three?
Jon, you and me.

395
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,410
You, me and Jon.
Then if we have to get rid of

396
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,329
Jon, we get rid of Jon.
>> Well, you'd better

397
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,873
hand-feed me real easy, okay?
>> I will. I will.

398
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,000
I will do everything I can
to keep you in the game

399
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,461
as long as possible.
And you have my word on that.

400
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,754
I mean, I'll do
a "Scout's honor."

401
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:03,465
I haven't done that...
>> I am proud of you.

402
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,008
>> ...since, like,
I was in Scouts.

403
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,511
>> Okay.
>> So, you got my word on that.

404
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,680
>> So, how are we going to
explain all this?

405
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,933
>> I'm going to tell them
that you babbled on about

406
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,684
Boy Scouts and stuff
until the cows came home,

407
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,937
and I fell asleep.
>> Don't make me out as a bitch.

408
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,980
Just make me out as some dumb
broad.

409
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,982
>> Lill, I would never
make you out as a bitch.

410
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:31,076
>> Okay.
>> I'm potentially

411
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:49,761
>> Okay.
>> I'm potentially

412
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:53,974
going to fall asleep.
Just giving you a heads-up.

413
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,856
So, I don't know what today's
going to be.

414
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:05,068
I'll go out fishing for a couple
hours, bring a bunch of fish

415
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:08,822
home, and I might just throw...
eight or ten uncleaned, unscaled

416
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,700
fish at Tijuana and D to clean.
And, "You want to eat?

417
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,702
There you go."
"I caught them for you,

418
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,204
you take care of it."
I think the Morgan Tribe is,

419
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,832
just in general, very lazy.
Uh... unmotivated people.

420
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,959
I mean, you can just tell
by their attitudes

421
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:24,129
towards things
and the way they try to sit down

422
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:27,382
all the time and talk.
We got firewood to gather,

423
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:30,051
we got water to get..
Things have to be done.

424
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:34,264
Talking is not acceptable 24/7
around here.

425
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,391
What is this?
Cheese.

426
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,018
(laughing)
You were sleeping

427
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,687
on cheese?
(laughter)

428
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,731
I didn't even realize it
till you pointed it out.

429
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,692
>> Here at the Balboa Tribe,
I do think that they work

430
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:48,236
a great deal more
than what is necessary.

431
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,530
Um...
it seems as if

432
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,866
when one person's working,
like, everybody has to be

433
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,618
working-- doing something,
even if it's frivolous or not.

434
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,578
And that's just, I don't know...
it just provides

435
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,247
even more tension.
'Cause, I don't feel like I have

436
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,583
as much of the personal freedom
to be who I am

437
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:05,503
like I did in the Morgan Tribe.
>> Now I know how Jesus felt.

438
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,977
>> PROBST: Okay, let's get to
today's Immunity Challenge,

439
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:25,857
which means, Rupert, give it up.
>> Okay.

440
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,818
>> PROBST: Once again,
Immunity back up for grabs.

441
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,613
You've been out here 24 days
in the Pearl Islands.

442
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,658
You are the final nine.
Seven of you will make up

443
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,743
our jury.
Two of you will make it

444
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:39,079
to the final vote.
One of you will be awarded

445
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,080
the million dollars
and the title

446
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,957
of "Sole Survivor."
Today's challenge: find out,

447
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,626
at this point in the game,
where do you stack up

448
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,461
in this tribe.
I'm going to ask you

449
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:48,421
a series of questions
based on the history

450
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,840
of this area.
Every time you answer

451
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,218
a question correctly,
you'll take one of your coconuts

452
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,219
and place it
in somebody else's

453
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,846
coconut holder.
When a person has five coconuts,

454
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,848
they're out of the game.
Last person left standing

455
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,351
wins Immunity,
guaranteed another three days

456
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,603
on the island.
Take a spot behind

457
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:07,274
your coconut holders.
We'll get started.

458
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,818
Here we go.
First question.

459
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,320
True or false:
if a pirate sets sail

460
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:17,117
in search of "pieces of eight,"
he'd be looking for

461
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,495
a small island chain
just off the Panamanian coast.

462
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,872
Correct answer: false.
"Pieces of eight"

463
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:26,418
are old Spanish coins.
T., Lill, Rupert, Christa,

464
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:31,339
got it right.
T., make your first move.

465
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,508
No way to hide what
you're thinking in this game.

466
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:35,385
>> Oh, Ryno.
>> PROBST: Ryno takes the first

467
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:41,474
hit.
Ryno takes another hit.

468
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,977
Rupert-- Blackbeard,
if there ever was one.

469
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,564
>> (chuckles)
>> Yeah-- I'm doing good.

470
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:51,026
(Rupert laughs)
>> PROBST: After one round,

471
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,361
four coconuts,
all of them in Ryno's bin.

472
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,323
Next question.
The act of throwing a man

473
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,366
overboard tied to a rope
and dragging him

474
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,161
underneath the ship
was a pirate punishment

475
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:04,998
known by what name:
A, "plank dive,"

476
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:09,544
B, "keel haul,"
or C, "bottom scratch."

477
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:12,088
"B" is the correct answer.
Lill and Christa are

478
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,716
the only two who got it wrong.
And just like that,

479
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,510
Ryno's out of the game.
Darrah going next door

480
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,889
to Christa.
>> Nobody hurts Christa.

481
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:25,560
>> What's up with that?
(laughing)

482
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:26,519
>> Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes,

483
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,480
with the coconuts.
>> PROBST: Darrah takes her

484
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:31,524
third coconut.
Ryno, you were right,

485
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,817
so you still get
to place a coconut.

486
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,778
>> Oh, God.
>> You all right, dude?

487
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,405
>> Yeah, I'm doing okay.
>> PROBST: Ryno, come down in

488
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,699
front, have a seat.
You're out of the game.

489
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,576
Next question.
Which explorer ransacked

490
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:46,247
the city of Panama in 1671,
leaving it burned

491
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,084
and in ruins?
Was it A., "Drake,"

492
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:53,546
or B., "Morgan?"
Correct answer: "B," Morgan.

493
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,424
Darrah, Lill, got it wrong.
Everybody else got it right.

494
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,886
>> Burton. (groans playfully)
>> PROBST: Burton takes his

495
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:03,223
first hit.
Burton going for Darrah.

496
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:07,310
Darrah takes her fourth coconut.
>> This is the death blow.

497
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,312
>> PROBST: And with that,
have a seat down in front,

498
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:12,440
Darrah.
T. takes her second hit.

499
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:17,237
That's three for T.
Next question: True or false;

500
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:23,118
Panama is a peninsula connecting
North and South America.

501
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,620
Correct answer: false.
It's not a "peninsula,"

502
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,455
it's an "isthmus."
T., Burton, Lill,

503
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:31,918
all got it right.
T. goes back to Burton.

504
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:35,171
Burton has two orange coconuts.
(all laughing)

505
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:38,216
>> PROBST: Why T., Burton?
>> Well, she just got me.

506
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,926
>> You got me first.
>> Well...

507
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,970
>> Where'd that come from?
>> When I went to breakfast

508
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,305
with this man,
all I did was the talking

509
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,307
and he just sat there
and nodded.

510
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,852
All right.
>> PROBST: Next question:

511
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:52,313
An instrument known as
a "cat-o'-nine-tails"

512
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,191
was most commonly used for
A., cooking;

513
00:28:55,275 --> 00:29:00,822
B., torture;
or C., mending tools?

514
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,700
"B." is correct.
Everyone but Sandra and Christa

515
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:06,953
got it right.
>> Nail in the coffin.

516
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,456
Here it comes.
It's your last coconut.

517
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,749
>> That's all right.
Hopefully, you'll get out, too.

518
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,501
>> PROBST: Burton.
>> I'm sorry. (T. laughing)

519
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,753
No, I'm not at all.
>> PROBST: And with this...

520
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,505
>> Have a seat.
>> PROBST: T. is out of the

521
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,008
game.
"Have a seat,"

522
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:24,345
as Burton says, T.
Jon goes for Sandra.

523
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,347
>> I'm still pissed
about the breakfast.

524
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,475
(all laughing)
>> Jeez!

525
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,810
>> Take him out, Lill!
>> Paybacks are a bitch, Lill.

526
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,688
>> And so am I.
>> Well, all right.

527
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:35,523
>> Whoa.
>> Sit down, Burton.

528
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,401
>> PROBST: Have a seat, Burton.
>> Sorry, man.

529
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,029
>> PROBST: Next question:
True or false:

530
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,908
a barnacle is a slab
of organic black tar

531
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,869
found on the bottom
of a pirate ship.

532
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:51,748
Correct answer: false.
Everybody but Jon got it right.

533
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,708
We know where your
next one's going, too.

534
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:55,710
>> Yep.
>> PROBST: Why Jon?

535
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:58,087
>> Jon knows the deal.
>> I don't know.

536
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,714
You put that down there,
you might not get up.

537
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:02,050
I know I'm loved.
You are loved.

538
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,552
>> PROBST: Lill takes her third
coconut.

539
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,055
Next question.
If a pirate was operating under

540
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,558
the commission of a government,
they were often referred to

541
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,811
by what name?
A., "buccaneer";

542
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,523
B., "privateer";
or C., "purser."

543
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,234
Correct answer:
B., "privateer."

544
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,070
Everybody but Lill got it right.
>> Well, since Rupert

545
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,614
doesn't have any...
>> Sandra...

546
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,032
>> I don't see
why he should be excluded.

547
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,201
>> Sandra's back
on my good list now.

548
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:32,247
(groans)
(Sandra laughs)

549
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,582
>> I don't know who's
going to get fish tonight.

550
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,085
>> Okay.
>> It's cool with me.

551
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,421
>> Okay, that's what I thought.
(Tijuana laughing)

552
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:45,260
What are you doing, putting
a coconut in my thing?

553
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,595
>> Ow.
>> PROBST: Next question.

554
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,556
If you've been struck
by a cutlass,

555
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:53,059
then you've just been wounded
by what?

556
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:56,646
A., ship's rudder;
B., grappling hook;

557
00:30:56,729 --> 00:31:01,609
C., a ship's anchor;
or D., a curved sword?

558
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,320
Correct answer is "D."
It's what you're playing for:

559
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:07,073
a curved sword.
Everybody but Christa

560
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:10,118
got it right.
I'm going to take him out,

561
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,830
'cause I know
he's taking me out.

562
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,457
>> PROBST: Jon's out of the
game, but you got it right.

563
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,793
One last bullet to shoot.
If I could shoot, like,

564
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:20,461
a three-pointer from here,
>> I would, Jeff.

565
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:25,341
(all laughing)
>> PROBST: Sandra, Jon, take a

566
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,760
seat.
>> (softly): I'm sorry.

567
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,930
>> PROBST: Lill gives one to
Rupert, and Rupert returns the

568
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,474
favor.
Lill, have a seat.

569
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,644
It's down to Rupert and Christa.
Which of the following terms

570
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:41,983
is not something you would find
in a pirate's treasure chest?

571
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,194
A., "doubloon";
B., "pieces of eight";

572
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:49,991
or C., "dory."
Christa says "pieces of eight."

573
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,160
That is wrong.
Rupert says "dory."

574
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,704
A dory is a flat-bottomed
fishing boat.

575
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,831
You are right--
you would not find that

576
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:59,292
in a buried treasure.
Go ahead and make

577
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,502
the ceremonial last placing...
>> Oh, my heart breaks.

578
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,297
>> PROBST: ...of the coconut.
>> Oh, mine too, baby.

579
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,299
I'm glad to get the chance to
put you out instead of anyone

580
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,634
else.
>> Thank you.

581
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,011
>> PROBST: And with that,
Rupert has immunity.

582
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:15,850
Rupert, come on over.
Turn around and slap it on.

583
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:19,354
Right there.
Tonight, Tribal Council,

584
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,190
Rupert is safe.
Everybody else is vulnerable.

585
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,692
You guys have this afternoon
to think about

586
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,152
what should be
a very interesting vote.

587
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:28,154
Head back to camp.
Congratulations.

588
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:38,206
>> Thank you.
>> Yeah.

589
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:46,881
>> Thank you.
>> Yeah.

590
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:49,509
(Rupert laughing)
I didn't want you

591
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:52,053
to feel lonely.
(Rupert laughing)

592
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,388
>> I didn't feel lonely.
I didn't...

593
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,515
I don't want
damn coconuts in my thing.

594
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:59,310
>> Every day's a new day.
>> I know there's still a game

595
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,562
on, but it's, you know...
it's hard not to get depressed

596
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,856
about things.
I mean, I'm not a pessimist,

597
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,567
but, you know, you get so much
crap thrown your way, it just

598
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,695
like... It just keeps coming at
you and keeps hammering you.

599
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,072
You're just like, "Oh, man.
Again? Again? Again?"

600
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,449
It's going to take
a minor miracle to get back

601
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,244
in this, but, you know,
I'll try as hard as I can

602
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:19,163
to get where I need to be.
I'm not... I'm not gonna quit.

603
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,915
I'm-I'm gonna go down
swinging...(laughing)

604
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:28,256
until I hear that bell.
>> A while back,

605
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:31,426
I talked to Burton to see
if he would be interested

606
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:35,221
in going five on four.
I've worked too hard.

607
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,223
You've worked too hard.
You know, I haven't given

608
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,308
up, but you guys need to...
maybe work Lill

609
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:42,478
and be like,
"Hey, let's try to get the five

610
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,815
of us on four and do this."
They'd get smoked by us,

611
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,650
and they wouldn't even
see it coming.

612
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:51,654
>> Yeah.
>> It'd be perfect.

613
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,614
>> Whoa, Ryno's
scrambling, huh?

614
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,783
>> Oh, my God,
he's scrambling.

615
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,327
He's trying
to suck Burton in.

616
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,955
I told Burton, "You...
you cross me, I'll kill you."

617
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:02,999
(chuckles)
>> He's like,

618
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,917
"No, no, no, no.
"That's why I gave

619
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,419
you that immunity.
I want you to know

620
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,129
I'm on your side."
>> He means it, too.

621
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,922
>> It would be nice to go
to Tribal Council,

622
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,133
get rid of Ryan,
who is one of the...

623
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:15,261
one of the leaders of the weak.
You got some damn

624
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,971
good definition
on your shoulders.

625
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:21,684
>> Well, thank you, Rupert.
Ryan has the potential to band

626
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:25,146
T. and Darrah
and maybe suck

627
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,357
Jon and Burton in
and give them five people

628
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:31,986
that they could just... they
could steamroll over all of us.

629
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:37,700
Over Sandra, Christa, I,
and Lill.

630
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,203
Now will they do that?
I hope to God, no.

631
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:43,289
>> I don't know.
I think the only chance is

632
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:45,291
to get rid of Burton first.
I mean, I don't

633
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,376
want to be a bitch,
but I think the first

634
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,837
opportunity to get him off...
I mean, just,

635
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,422
I don't want him to win
the whole freaking thing.

636
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,632
>> Yeah.
>> I mean, I don't know...

637
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:55,301
I don't have a personal problem
with him, but I just feel

638
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:58,721
like he's a strong guy.
He's mentally and physically

639
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,390
very strong.
Rupe's back.

640
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:05,019
Ryno, that guy is the least
trustable guy out of anyone

641
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,397
here.
>> Really?

642
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:12,026
>> Mm-hmm.
>> Why roll the dice?

643
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:14,529
You know, it's... it's stupid
to let him even try, so...

644
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,323
>> Mm-hmm.
I'm not really sure

645
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:20,535
what to do right now.
It's a very confusing situation.

646
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,661
It's a...
I've never promised

647
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:25,832
anybody anything out here,
so I don't feel like I've lied

648
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,543
to anybody quite yet.
>> Ryno is like...

649
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,212
>> Dude, he's...
>> He is scrambling.

650
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,840
>> ...at high red alert.
Like, "You know Sandra, Christa,

651
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:37,426
Rupert, and Jon all see you
"as a threat, they're a really

652
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,887
strong foursome, and as soon
"as it gets down to it,

653
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,556
you're gonna be
"next one to go,

654
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,225
you know that."
>> "Jon's... Jon's a snake.

655
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,852
He said he'd flip on you guys."
>> Yep.

656
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,603
>> He goes, "It'd be a shame
to, you know...

657
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,897
to know you worked so hard
and got back into the game, then

658
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,732
just get voted right out again."
I'm like, "Ooh, yeah, yeah,

659
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,860
I don't want that to happen."
>> Burton and I see

660
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,737
how tight Rupert,
Sandra, and Christa are.

661
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,782
And, as a result, we know
there's no chance with...

662
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,909
for either one of us to go
any further

663
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,871
between the three, so something
has to be done.

664
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,623
I'm, I'm willing to go stab
anybody in the back

665
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:11,127
at any given time
as long as it benefits me.

666
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,920
I came into the game
with that philosophy,

667
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,715
and no friendships...
no friendships have changed that

668
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,884
thus far,
and they're not going to--

669
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:22,388
day 22, day 23, 24, 38,
doesn't matter.

670
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:28,853
>> Okay, we're off.
So don't trust them.

671
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,898
And if they trust me, cool,
but they shouldn't.

672
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,959
>> PROBST: Let's get to it.
Lill, start with you.

673
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:55,630
Two very adversarial tribes
now forced to live together.

674
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,591
How is that going?
>> It's been great for me.

675
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,635
Um, I feel like I have a new
family.

676
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,137
I feel like I have,
in the last few days,

677
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,182
just to have come alive.
More of my personality

678
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,476
comes out.
I feel myself laughing more,

679
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,312
and, uh...
it's just a different

680
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,939
atmosphere for me.
And, I...

681
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,274
I'm sorry, I love it.
>> PROBST: Christa, do you

682
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,817
notice a difference in the work
ethic?

683
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,655
>> Well, uh, I wish there was
more, you know, initiative.

684
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,865
I just wish people would just
get up and do something,

685
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,159
you know?
It's like, "What do we need?"

686
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:28,329
It's like, "Look around."
Like, for example, today,

687
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,830
Darrah was sitting around
talking with T.,

688
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,625
and they were all
just chatting away.

689
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:35,252
And I don't want to be the one
to be like, "Hey, everybody,

690
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,254
we need firewood."
It's kind of like,

691
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,341
take a glance and, you know.
I mean, I don't want

692
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,343
to tell people what to do,
'cause it's not my job

693
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,470
to tell people what to do.
>> PROBST: Darrah?

694
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:47,264
>> Um, at the Morgan Tribe,
we would sit around

695
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:50,351
and joke around
and laugh a little bit all day

696
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,019
and rest.
And then, all of a sudden,

697
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,522
we would all get up and go
get firewood at one time

698
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,524
and have enough
firewood for two days.

699
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,651
At the Drake Tribe,
it's like,

700
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:01,028
you got to have firewood
every five minutes.

701
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,739
I know I have to get firewood,
I'll go get firewood.

702
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,325
You know, I may not get it
when she's getting it,

703
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,911
but I'll get it eventually,
sometime during the day.

704
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,371
>> PROBST: Rupert, how has
it been for you?

705
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,916
>> To be honest,
it is getting harder

706
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,712
day by day to live together.
Everybody in this tribe needs

707
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,715
to know that they can do better,
including me.

708
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,050
So, when we pick
on each other,

709
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,427
we need to look
at ourselves, too.

710
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,388
>> Burton...
you were out of this game,

711
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,223
had a chance for
some perspective,

712
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:31,600
come back into the game,
and now we merge together

713
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,894
as one tribe.
What's your take on the dynamic

714
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,439
of the nine of you?
>> Well, I have to say,

715
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:39,233
when I came back in,
the dynamic of the Drake Tribe

716
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,777
was better than ever--
my trust with them,

717
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,196
their trust with me,
and just everyone

718
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,574
getting along.
There are more Drakes

719
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,326
than there are Morgans,
so that, I think,

720
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,912
creates a bit of uneasiness.
>> PROBST: Well, from this

721
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:56,125
point forward, the voting has
a different significance,

722
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,753
because you are now the jury,
seven of you,

723
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,297
so when you vote somebody out,
you're voting somebody out,

724
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,258
who is, in the end,
going to sit across from you

725
00:39:04,341 --> 00:39:06,218
and determine
which of the final two

726
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,095
gets a million dollars.
Rupert is the only person

727
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,723
you cannot vote for.
Everybody else is fair game.

728
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:13,100
Having said that,
it is time to vote-- Sandra,

729
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:27,782
you're up.
>> I'm sorry we weren't

730
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:31,869
on the same team.
I know you would have been

731
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,954
good with me.
I would trade you

732
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:38,334
for a bunch of my guys,
but it's your time to go.

733
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,265
Hey, Christa, I didn't like you
before, don't like you now.

734
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:56,685
You're just, plain and simply,
a bitch.

735

Person voted out

will be asked to leave

That's two votes Ryno.

Ryno, that's
three votes.

743
00:41:05,462 --> 00:41:10,551
Ryno, that's four.
Eighth person voted

744

out of the tribe: Ryan.
You need to

745
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,847
bring me your torch.
That's five notes,

746
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:20,561
that's enough.
The rest will remain a mystery.

747
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:26,317
Ryan, the tribe has spoken.
>> I'll be back, guys.

748
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,206
>> PROBST: Tribal Council is

Sometimes they come back

total bummer.

to the end.
I knew I wasn't a quitter,
