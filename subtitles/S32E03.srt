00:00:02,287 --> 00:00:04,713
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:05,352 --> 00:00:08,450
In the Intelligence tribe, 
Debbie's eccentricity...

4
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:11,653
We have the biggest frontal lobes!

5
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:14,089
...designated it as a pawn 
to be used in the game.

6
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:15,782
This is exactly what is needed,

7
00:00:15,907 --> 00:00:17,540
an Intelligent who has no game.

8
00:00:17,665 --> 00:00:18,994
In the Beauty tribe,

9
00:00:19,244 --> 00:00:21,154
the women's alliance was growing stronger.

10
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,698
An alliance of girls 
seemed natural to me.

11
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:25,702
While 
Tai's idol hunt...

12
00:00:25,827 --> 00:00:28,169
First, you will need a key 
to open this box.

13
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:29,505
This tool will help you.

14
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,901
...became desperate.

15
00:00:31,026 --> 00:00:32,532
I can't have the idol.

16
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:34,267
I will have to come back another day.

17
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,403
At the last immunity test,

18
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,748
the Muscles tribe lost again.

19
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,609
...Returning Muscles to the Council!

20
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:44,753
Approaching the board,

21
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,869
Alecia seemed like 
the obvious choice.

22
00:00:46,994 --> 00:00:48,281
Blondie is useless.

23
00:00:48,406 --> 00:00:50,025
But Jenny hesitated.

24
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,584
Jason is starting to piss me off.

25
00:00:52,538 --> 00:00:53,733
On the advice...

26
00:00:53,858 --> 00:00:56,523
There were hesitations, 
"What do we do?"

27
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:58,767
...Jenny revealed her indecision.

28
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,702
Now I wonder.

29
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,062
And she paid dearly for it,

30
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:05,632
saving Alecia 
for the second tip in a row.

31
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,410
Jenny, the tribe has spoken.

32
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,197
There are 16 left.

33
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,182
Who will be eliminated tonight?

34
00:01:31,914 --> 00:01:33,393
Alecia, just so you know,

35
00:01:33,518 --> 00:01:35,831
I am the 2nd person 
who voted against you.

36
00:01:35,956 --> 00:01:38,726
But I already knew 
there would be three votes against Jenny.

37
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:41,234
I had promised him 
not to write his name, that's all.

38
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,360
OK.

39
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:44,718
- That's all. Without resentment. 
- Great.

40
00:01:44,843 --> 00:01:46,882
I just don't get 
why you would write...

41
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,928
...my name, if Jenny 
leaves anyway.

42
00:01:49,053 --> 00:01:50,430
I don't get it. But...

43
00:01:50,555 --> 00:01:52,320
- I have just told you. 
- Its good.

44
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,613
I am loyal.

45
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,955
Scotus said, "I only wrote your name

46
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,218
only because I knew 
Jenny was leaving."

47
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:01,221
I don't think I've ever 
heard anything so stupid.

48
00:02:01,346 --> 00:02:02,524
We go to the well.

49
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:05,158
"I can't believe you 
wrote my name anyway."

50
00:02:05,283 --> 00:02:08,094
If you betray my trust once, 
you won't get it back.

51
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:10,605
Scott must go.

52
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,555
He is a millionaire, 
he played ten years for the NBA.

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,238
- You know ? 
- Yeah.

54
00:02:15,363 --> 00:02:17,904
Alecia constantly baffles me.

55
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:21,207
She thinks we're allies 
and it's "us against them."

56
00:02:21,332 --> 00:02:24,065
But she doesn't know how 
close I am to guys.

57
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,512
I just do:

58
00:02:25,637 --> 00:02:28,415
"Mmh, that sounds good, I'm walking, whatever 
you want, I'm walking."

59
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,549
I really think 
we made a mistake tonight.

60
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:33,693
That's why.

61
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:36,222
How to win the next event 
with 3 1/2 people?

62
00:02:36,347 --> 00:02:38,258
All I can say

63
00:02:38,383 --> 00:02:41,925
is that with this vote, 
I believe that she trusts me more,

64
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,563
which is good for all of us.

65
00:02:45,017 --> 00:02:47,567
- She clearly wants me gone. 
- In effect.

66
00:02:47,887 --> 00:02:50,103
Things have changed a lot 
tonight at the council.

67
00:02:50,228 --> 00:02:54,417
I lost a third 
of my original alliance.

68
00:02:54,881 --> 00:02:59,045
And here, Alecia feels reinforced 
and could get me in trouble.

69
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,980
So many changes in one day!

70
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,400
Breakfast is ready.

71
00:03:14,635 --> 00:03:16,029
Tai will eat the rest.

72
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,332
He is crazy. 
He eats fish heads,

73
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,132
he eats everything.

74
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:23,869
People watch each 
other like hawks.

75
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:26,473
But I'm going to get the idol 
now. It is time.

76
00:03:26,955 --> 00:03:29,217
A chance. 
My only one, I think.

77
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:33,726
I think the tribe 
really appreciates me, on a human level.

78
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:37,004
But only the idol 
will give me a sense of security.

79
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:38,351
I know where she is

80
00:03:38,476 --> 00:03:40,676
I just have to get the key out.

81
00:03:41,562 --> 00:03:44,746
Gotta take a stick, 
tie the tool to it

82
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,269
and poke through the container

83
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,564
to push the key.

84
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:50,300
No that's not true !

85
00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:51,631
Where is the tool?

86
00:03:52,053 --> 00:03:53,475
It's too stupid.

87
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,849
Don't tell me 
I left it somewhere else.

88
00:03:56,088 --> 00:03:58,545
I don't know how, 
I lost the tool.

89
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,492
I want myself to death.

90
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:02,992
I don't get anything easily 
in life.

91
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,245
Including this idol.

92
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,080
I see you.

93
00:04:07,517 --> 00:04:08,982
Hi !

94
00:04:09,107 --> 00:04:10,826
All my life I have known challenges.

95
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:12,827
In Vietnam, in the refugee camp,

96
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,189
when I came to the USA 
and had to reinvent myself...

97
00:04:15,314 --> 00:04:17,465
And that is another big challenge.

98
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:21,001
So I had to make myself 
another tool for my stick.

99
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:24,097
You are going to be tough 
for me, my friend.

100
00:04:24,343 --> 00:04:26,698
It will happen, 
please, please!

101
00:04:26,823 --> 00:04:30,200
Please ! 
Go back... with me!

102
00:04:30,325 --> 00:04:31,794
We're made for each other.

103
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:43,444
Get in there!

104
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,968
Yes ! Yes !

105
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,250
Oh my God !

106
00:05:00,823 --> 00:05:03,661
â€œCongratulations, you have found the key 
to the Immunity Idol.

107
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:06,481
Follow the map 
to free your treasure."

108
00:05:06,822 --> 00:05:07,825
Merci !

109
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:09,624
Thank you, tree!

110
00:05:14,576 --> 00:05:17,074
It's been way too long.

111
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:19,872
Come see dad.

112
00:05:19,997 --> 00:05:21,483
Here we are.

113
00:05:24,072 --> 00:05:25,091
Oh, here it is!

114
00:05:25,923 --> 00:05:28,261
Oh, my God, this is going to save my life.

115
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,514
It'll save my life.

116
00:05:32,803 --> 00:05:35,135
I found the idol. 
I worked so hard for this!

117
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,504
Jeff made it so... 
It's not easy!

118
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,063
But I never give up.

119
00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:41,918
Because the idol and I 
are made for each other.

120
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:44,177
"Immunity Idol Rules."

121
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:49,044
"If you want to use the idol, 
say so after the vote..."

122
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:50,950
Yes, I know this rule well.

123
00:05:51,075 --> 00:05:52,276
"There is a surprise.

124
00:05:52,401 --> 00:05:55,481
If you match 
two immunity idols,

125
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,860
they form a super-idol.

126
00:05:57,985 --> 00:06:01,471
A super-idol can be played 
after the votes are read."

127
00:06:04,128 --> 00:06:05,340
It is serious ?!

128
00:06:05,822 --> 00:06:07,390
After reading the votes!

129
00:06:07,515 --> 00:06:11,223
Two idols that come together 
form a super-idol

130
00:06:11,348 --> 00:06:13,069
who can save a person.

131
00:06:13,194 --> 00:06:14,828
It's fantastic !

132
00:06:15,193 --> 00:06:17,177
It's quite a surprise 
for this season!

133
00:06:17,302 --> 00:06:19,157
I'm going to wear it a little bit.

134
00:06:57,141 --> 00:07:00,335
Here we are, planning 
our victory strategy,

135
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,722
and we have a guy 
working his chocolate bars.

136
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,325
It's the Intelligence tribe!

137
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:10,030
I have a central alliance with Liz,

138
00:07:10,155 --> 00:07:12,699
but we manage 
two separate groups of two.

139
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,286
Debbie and Joe,

140
00:07:14,411 --> 00:07:15,918
and Aubry and Neal.

141
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,103
But we have control.

142
00:07:18,444 --> 00:07:21,658
It would be a mistake 
to take out Debbie or Joe.

143
00:07:21,783 --> 00:07:23,283
They are puppets.

144
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:26,490
I would love to have them at the end, 
for the ultimate immunity test.

145
00:07:26,615 --> 00:07:28,481
It would be a guarantee, for me.

146
00:07:29,423 --> 00:07:33,826
Peter and I are looking 
for a tight-knit herd of loyal players

147
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:36,122
to guide towards the mixture of tribes 
and fusion.

148
00:07:36,935 --> 00:07:38,733
Debbie seems ideal.

149
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,675
She doesn't seem to have the motivation 
to make a big move.

150
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,263
She's the king's jester.

151
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,066
Joe will probably be 
a loyal soldier.

152
00:07:46,522 --> 00:07:50,245
Aubry doesn't want to talk too much about the game 
or stuff like that.

153
00:07:50,495 --> 00:07:53,705
Neal, on the other hand, is very smart

154
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,048
and could very well eliminate 
one of us by surprise

155
00:07:57,173 --> 00:07:58,678
after mixing or merging.

156
00:07:58,803 --> 00:08:01,163
So we just need 
to split the votes.

157
00:08:01,288 --> 00:08:04,255
We're not telling Deb or Joe 
yet.

158
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,076
So we tell them to vote for...

159
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:08,039
We vote for Aubry.

160
00:08:08,535 --> 00:08:11,624
We have to see it from an 
analytical point of view, think about what we have

161
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:14,396
and all the time that remains. 
It's only been seven days.

162
00:08:14,704 --> 00:08:17,505
Let's put these elements together 
to come up with a good plan.

163
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:19,245
We have things well in hand.

164
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,255
We play like bosses.

165
00:08:22,424 --> 00:08:23,970
My position in this tribe

166
00:08:24,095 --> 00:08:27,148
is to settle down, observe, 
close it and gather information.

167
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:30,218
Peter really feels superior

168
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,255
and Liz is our diva princess.

169
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,750
Their goal is to eliminate us all, 
while we do all the work.

170
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:40,120
For now, 
Peter is an asset in the trials.

171
00:08:40,245 --> 00:08:42,856
So the one who has to go 
is Liz.

172
00:08:43,485 --> 00:08:45,025
I see it clearly.

173
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:48,028
If we recruit Aubry and Neal,

174
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:52,143
we have a solid quartet, 
we take Liz out by surprise,

175
00:08:52,268 --> 00:08:56,545
this damn diva 
who groans about everything.

176
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:58,807
We agree ?

177
00:08:58,932 --> 00:09:03,351
We need to form this foursome 
before Liz and Peter do.

178
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,269
To separate Liz and Peter, 
we have to be subversive,

179
00:09:07,394 --> 00:09:09,549
set up counterintelligence,

180
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,232
we have to act with a purpose, Joe!

181
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,688
And we have to do it now!

182
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,201
I'm asking you outright.

183
00:09:17,326 --> 00:09:19,059
What do you think of Neal?

184
00:09:19,347 --> 00:09:22,080
That he is frank with me.

185
00:09:22,205 --> 00:09:23,992
Good. Me too.

186
00:09:24,117 --> 00:09:26,511
- What are you thinking about ? 
- I like it.

187
00:09:28,464 --> 00:09:31,009
- I felt like it. 
- Good.

188
00:09:31,134 --> 00:09:32,934
Good, very good. Very well.

189
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:36,475
If you face me,

190
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,988
expect 
superior and smarter tactics from me.

191
00:09:40,238 --> 00:09:42,238
The bomb bay is open.

192
00:09:42,645 --> 00:09:44,417
Prepare to fire!

193
00:09:44,737 --> 00:09:46,252
I fully trust you

194
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,175
and I hope 
we have a solid quartet.

195
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,625
What is beautiful in what I do,

196
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,943
it's that nobody 
pays attention to me.

197
00:09:55,068 --> 00:09:57,282
And that's exactly 
what I want to do:

198
00:09:57,407 --> 00:09:58,756
fly under the radar.

199
00:09:58,881 --> 00:10:02,177
During this time, I relax 
and collect information.

200
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,904
'Cause that's how 
we play this game, honey!

201
00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:19,413
- Do you enjoy eating a chicken? 
- Mmm.

202
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:22,697
The one with fewer feathers 
would be best, I think.

203
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,924
He is bigger.

204
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:26,330
We'll kill that one, then.

205
00:10:26,455 --> 00:10:28,536
Killing a chicken 
is best for our tribe.

206
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:29,763
We are all hungry.

207
00:10:29,888 --> 00:10:31,915
But some 
get attached to animals,

208
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,168
like Tai.

209
00:10:33,293 --> 00:10:35,971
It shows his sensitivity.

210
00:10:36,096 --> 00:10:38,104
We'll make sure to be by his side,

211
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,606
because it's hard for him.

212
00:10:42,593 --> 00:10:43,876
Do you see that sound?

213
00:10:44,001 --> 00:10:45,912
- I hear it. 
- They're pretty happy.

214
00:10:46,037 --> 00:10:47,342
They look good.

215
00:10:47,467 --> 00:10:49,156
Maybe they will escape!

216
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,147
- Don't think about it... 
- No, I can't do that.

217
00:10:52,272 --> 00:10:53,534
If they disappear...

218
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:55,513
Tai is guilty!

219
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,832
To me, we don't need 
to kill that chicken.

220
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,691
But boys need protein to 
be strong in the tests.

221
00:11:00,816 --> 00:11:02,124
It is the cycle of life.

222
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:04,639
We have to eat something, 
which eats something else...

223
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,268
You know, the cycle of life.

224
00:11:06,393 --> 00:11:09,010
As long as we are aware 
of the whole... And no waste.

225
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,603
Above all, no waste.

226
00:11:11,327 --> 00:11:14,168
I have to catch it somehow, 
you're gonna have to hold it.

227
00:11:14,293 --> 00:11:15,543
Sorry, buddy.

228
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,552
Come back for a better life!

229
00:11:28,716 --> 00:11:30,390
- It'll be OK ? 
- Yeah.

230
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,103
Just to see 
life slip away into my hand...

231
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:35,637
I feel like...

232
00:11:36,286 --> 00:11:37,622
...to have done wrong.

233
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:38,832
Very bad.

234
00:11:39,356 --> 00:11:41,201
His feet are already cold.

235
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,670
Yeah, he's dead. 
It's just the nerves moving.

236
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:45,862
You know, it had to be done.

237
00:11:45,987 --> 00:11:48,149
But it's still very hard to live with.

238
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,377
It's still a life you took.

239
00:11:54,825 --> 00:11:55,971
He is sad.

240
00:11:57,164 --> 00:11:59,124
I don't like 
when people cry.

241
00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:01,696
Who that, Tai? 
Oh, yeah, he was shaken.

242
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,665
think of tai trop

243
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,373
he has all these feelings, 
these emotions that need to come out,

244
00:12:06,498 --> 00:12:08,294
and that's not the way 
to play.

245
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:12,265
My friends would compare me to a robot, 
a cold-blooded being.

246
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,669
But we don't need 
emotions here.

247
00:12:14,794 --> 00:12:16,602
We just have to seem to have some.

248
00:12:16,727 --> 00:12:18,872
He is in pain, it shows.

249
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,735
I sympathize.

250
00:12:21,748 --> 00:12:22,942
It'll be fine for Tai.

251
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:24,811
Animals 
eat other animals.

252
00:12:24,936 --> 00:12:26,680
They're here for that.

253
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:29,313
Something about Nick 
doesn't inspire confidence.

254
00:12:29,438 --> 00:12:30,744
It's hard to talk to him.

255
00:12:30,869 --> 00:12:34,388
He's just a big smile, 
he irritates me.

256
00:12:34,873 --> 00:12:38,099
I trust Caleb and Tai.

257
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:41,428
We are three girls and three boys, 
we must recruit one of the boys.

258
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:44,111
That's the thing. 
The girls want to stay together,

259
00:12:44,236 --> 00:12:46,718
and these girls and I 
are super loyal.

260
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,475
And never... Anyway, it's a game, 
I could bamboozle you,

261
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,813
but I would 
never betray you like that.

262
00:12:52,673 --> 00:12:55,342
But here's the thing: 
I don't trust Nick.

263
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:57,177
Truly not.

264
00:12:58,093 --> 00:13:01,167
The girls 
form a very solid trio.

265
00:13:02,063 --> 00:13:05,053
Anna offered me 
to join the girls

266
00:13:05,178 --> 00:13:07,147
and we'd eliminate Nick.

267
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,089
This is not a bad thing, 
because in case of defeat,

268
00:13:10,214 --> 00:13:11,791
that means I'm not leaving.

269
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,566
I really don't want to lose.

270
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:15,403
If we lose, it will be...

271
00:13:15,966 --> 00:13:17,666
...drama in shambles.

272
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,543
More litter and leaves.

273
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,545
Like everywhere I looked.

274
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,415
I try to find the idol,

275
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,591
because I don't trust Alecia.

276
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,186
But there are plenty of places to 
hide an idol!

277
00:13:40,311 --> 00:13:42,589
If there is a clue or an idol,

278
00:13:42,714 --> 00:13:45,697
we 
obviously don't want Alecia to find her.

279
00:13:54,061 --> 00:13:55,845
Brothel!

280
00:13:58,098 --> 00:14:00,386
"The idol is buried 
at the foot of this tree."

281
00:14:00,511 --> 00:14:01,873
Let's dig!

282
00:14:02,518 --> 00:14:04,286
A priori, 
I am at the bottom of the scale.

283
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:06,343
And I see a clue 
to find the idol.

284
00:14:06,468 --> 00:14:08,123
That's power, in this game.

285
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:11,604
With the idol, it's like, you're at the bottom 
of the ladder, you take it out and...

286
00:14:11,729 --> 00:14:12,819
You are at the top.

287
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:19,521
I walk,

288
00:14:19,646 --> 00:14:21,695
and here's Alecia and Cydney, 
digging.

289
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:23,430
I'm not stupid.

290
00:14:23,555 --> 00:14:25,255
They are looking for the idol.

291
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,534
- Jason is looking at us. 
- Where ? Where ? Where ?

292
00:14:30,522 --> 00:14:32,640
Was he there long? 
I have not seen it.

293
00:14:32,765 --> 00:14:33,915
- One moment. 
- Shut up.

294
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,276
They'll think it's here. 
We have to find her.

295
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:37,936
But we have to find the hoe.

296
00:14:38,061 --> 00:14:39,062
I stay here.

297
00:14:39,187 --> 00:14:40,705
More, Alecia! Alecia!

298
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,257
Act normal !

299
00:14:46,341 --> 00:14:48,341
And so, I found the idol!

300
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,473
I'll wait until 
she's gone...

301
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:57,267
I let Alecia go,

302
00:14:57,392 --> 00:14:59,667
because I found 
a small tool with a clue

303
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:01,241
and I'm like, "Oh, seriously?"

304
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:03,436
So I start to dig deep,

305
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:06,811
and I scratch with my fingers, 
and it says "idol" on it.

306
00:15:06,936 --> 00:15:08,874
But the box is padlocked!

307
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:11,478
How the hell 
am I going to open this box?

308
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:15,523
And without warning, 
she was already back,

309
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,359
so I covered it.

310
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,242
I couldn't find it anywhere.

311
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:24,591
The hoe?

312
00:15:24,913 --> 00:15:26,192
We need the hoe.

313
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:27,805
Are you going back there?

314
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,617
- Yes. 
- OK.

315
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:41,207
I'm going to rinse my hair.

316
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,316
She found a clue.

317
00:15:47,075 --> 00:15:48,676
Did she find a clue?

318
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:52,744
What's he saying ?

319
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:55,722
"The idol is buried 
at the foot of this tree."

320
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:57,198
What tree?

321
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,025
- Where you saw us. 
- Is that where she found the clue?

322
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:03,779
Of course, Jason having seen us, 
I had to tell him.

323
00:16:03,904 --> 00:16:06,304
It's so 
that they don't wonder,

324
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:08,601
that they don't think I'm 
allied with her.

325
00:16:20,986 --> 00:16:23,648
I may be 
one of the best bounty hunters

326
00:16:23,773 --> 00:16:25,086
of southwestern Michigan.

327
00:16:25,211 --> 00:16:26,394
The tree was there.

328
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,939
- This tree? 
- No, I caught them there.

329
00:16:29,064 --> 00:16:30,156
Here they are.

330
00:16:30,468 --> 00:16:32,722
In my job, 
if we give you a tip,

331
00:16:33,073 --> 00:16:35,851
you have a few seconds, 
minutes, hours maybe.

332
00:16:35,976 --> 00:16:37,130
So you get active!

333
00:16:37,255 --> 00:16:40,342
I try to approach this game 
as I approach my job.

334
00:16:40,872 --> 00:16:41,873
I got it !

335
00:16:42,797 --> 00:16:45,107
Did you find a clue? 
What's he saying ?

336
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:46,580
I found it pretty quickly.

337
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:49,033
I found the clue, 
the box, locked.

338
00:16:49,158 --> 00:16:50,677
And the clue has a map.

339
00:16:50,934 --> 00:16:52,012
I had to act.

340
00:16:53,194 --> 00:16:55,156
Is it the idol or the clue?

341
00:16:58,981 --> 00:16:59,986
My God !

342
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:07,305
I took off like a rocket.

343
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,580
You keep the rhythm or I lose you.

344
00:17:15,889 --> 00:17:18,113
â€œCongratulations, 
you have found the Immunity Idol.

345
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:20,907
But first, you will need a key 
to open this box."

346
00:17:21,922 --> 00:17:24,778
The map was quite telling. 
Then it's a matter of looking,

347
00:17:25,122 --> 00:17:28,087
to be attentive to details, 
to differences, to what is missing.

348
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,507
Here it is !

349
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:31,813
I found the key.

350
00:17:31,938 --> 00:17:34,977
To get it out, you have to push 
into a hole underneath.

351
00:17:35,102 --> 00:17:36,752
But the tool is gone.

352
00:17:36,877 --> 00:17:38,219
We don't know where he is.

353
00:17:38,344 --> 00:17:41,136
It was dumped somewhere, 
the girls didn't know what it was...

354
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:42,262
Who knows ?

355
00:17:42,387 --> 00:17:44,851
- You told her ? 
- Nope. He saw us. That's all.

356
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:51,805
- We're taken. 
- What are you doing ?

357
00:17:52,255 --> 00:17:54,545
Scot and I 
made a makeshift tool

358
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,918
to get the key.

359
00:17:56,043 --> 00:17:58,745
Obviously, Blondie stands there 
to try to sting him.

360
00:17:59,248 --> 00:18:01,414
And... I can't allow it.

361
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:02,839
It will get warmer.

362
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:15,650
Just there.

363
00:18:19,657 --> 00:18:20,707
Hold on !

364
00:18:21,272 --> 00:18:22,372
Get out of there !

365
00:18:35,928 --> 00:18:37,064
Got it, Scott!

366
00:18:37,189 --> 00:18:39,834
In this game, if you want something, 
you have to go get it.

367
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:42,731
And it was good to have an 
NBA player on my side.

368
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:45,392
Especially a swivel! 
You know, with his size!

369
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,670
It paid off!

370
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:50,165
The buried treasure!

371
00:18:50,648 --> 00:18:52,098
The buried treasure...

372
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,811
Coolest thing 
I've seen all week.

373
00:18:57,296 --> 00:18:59,023
I found the clue.

374
00:18:59,148 --> 00:19:01,758
But alas, Jason has the idol.

375
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,245
It was all very disturbing, 
it happened so quickly.

376
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,048
Honestly, at this point, 
I don't trust anyone.

377
00:19:08,173 --> 00:19:09,684
It's the roller coaster.

378
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:11,187
First I'm on top,

379
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:13,687
and there, I think I'm back 
at the bottom of the ladder.

380
00:19:14,048 --> 00:19:16,711
"There is a surprise. If you combine 
two immunity idols,

381
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:18,913
they form a super-idol.

382
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:21,903
A super-idol can be played 
after the votes are read."

383
00:19:23,174 --> 00:19:24,274
Yin et yang.

384
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:28,660
If we find the other, 
it doesn't matter if they vote against us!

385
00:19:28,785 --> 00:19:30,641
"Twin Idol Power 
Activated!"

386
00:19:30,766 --> 00:19:32,193
We will stay, in fact!

387
00:19:32,318 --> 00:19:34,641
It's idol time! 
She is in good hands.

388
00:19:34,766 --> 00:19:37,163
I bind mine, 
but I trust,

389
00:19:37,288 --> 00:19:38,853
Jason will protect me.

390
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:41,014
We just want to make sure 
Alecia doesn't get it,

391
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:44,217
because unless there is a very easy test, 
I doubt that we will win.

392
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,065
Now she is in the minority 
and she will come out.

393
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:05,672
Over here, everyone!

394
00:20:10,973 --> 00:20:15,145
Intelligence, Beauty, 
discover the new Muscles tribe.

395
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:18,593
Jenny was eliminated 
at the last council.

396
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:19,861
Amazing.

397
00:20:22,378 --> 00:20:25,066
Ready for today's immunity test 
?

398
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:26,688
Glad to hear that!

399
00:20:26,813 --> 00:20:29,032
First of all, I take back the idols.

400
00:20:29,157 --> 00:20:30,307
Thank you, Julia.

401
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:31,482
Thank you, Liz.

402
00:20:34,962 --> 00:20:37,779
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

403
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,139
Today,

404
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:43,450
you will jump from a platform 
and swim to a boat

405
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,987
where you will collect 
three bags of rice.

406
00:20:46,237 --> 00:20:49,976
Together you will push 
and pull these bags through a hole.

407
00:20:50,728 --> 00:20:54,095
Then you will cross a plank 
and return to the beach.

408
00:20:54,758 --> 00:20:56,531
There you will rip open the sacks,

409
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:58,058
looking for three balls.

410
00:20:58,767 --> 00:21:02,437
Then, one team member at a time, 
balancing on a board,

411
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:05,807
will take a ball through 
a maze of holes

412
00:21:06,215 --> 00:21:07,340
to the top.

413
00:21:07,465 --> 00:21:10,804
The first two tribes 
to bring their three balls to the top

414
00:21:12,776 --> 00:21:14,761
gain immunity, 
are shielded from the vote.

415
00:21:14,886 --> 00:21:16,330
The losers will go to the board

416
00:21:16,455 --> 00:21:19,593
where someone will be 
the 3rd person eliminated from the game.

417
00:21:19,718 --> 00:21:22,482
You are also playing for a reward. 
Want to know what's at stake?

418
00:21:23,842 --> 00:21:26,434
The first tribe to finish 
will have a choice.

419
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,459
You can choose between...

420
00:21:32,218 --> 00:21:33,868
Comfort material.

421
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:36,611
Or, if you want...

422
00:21:39,621 --> 00:21:41,639
Your emotional objects,

423
00:21:41,764 --> 00:21:45,448
to remind you of the inspiration 
that brought you here.

424
00:21:46,006 --> 00:21:48,147
The first tribe to finish 
will have a choice.

425
00:21:48,272 --> 00:21:50,119
The second tribe 
will have what is left.

426
00:21:50,244 --> 00:21:52,044
The third tribe: nothing.

427
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:55,217
A date with me at the council, 
someone leaving.

428
00:21:55,582 --> 00:21:57,984
Beauty, two people 
will not participate. Who ?

429
00:21:59,001 --> 00:22:00,253
Anna and Michele.

430
00:22:00,378 --> 00:22:02,722
- Intelligence, who in your house? 
- Joe and I.

431
00:22:02,847 --> 00:22:05,003
Aubrey and Joe. 
Take a seat on the bench.

432
00:22:05,128 --> 00:22:07,560
The others, one minute 
to get organized and we'll start.

433
00:22:16,662 --> 00:22:17,980
Well, on and go.

434
00:22:18,362 --> 00:22:20,489
For reward and immunity.

435
00:22:20,614 --> 00:22:21,941
Survivors, ready?

436
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,491
One person 
must board the boat

437
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:32,216
and pass the three bags 
to your teammates.

438
00:22:32,596 --> 00:22:34,796
Neal is on board for Intelligence.

439
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:36,649
Caleb is on board for Beauty.

440
00:22:36,774 --> 00:22:38,724
Scot is on board for Muscles.

441
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:41,183
Put this rice 
in the hands of your teammates.

442
00:22:41,308 --> 00:22:42,829
- Go on ! 
- On the shoulder !

443
00:22:42,954 --> 00:22:44,781
These bags are heavy.

444
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,443
The three tribes have their rice.

445
00:22:48,924 --> 00:22:52,022
Now you have to pass it 
through a very small hole,

446
00:22:52,147 --> 00:22:53,663
one bag at a time.

447
00:22:54,219 --> 00:22:57,544
You can send someone 
to the other side to help you.

448
00:22:57,913 --> 00:22:59,478
Caleb goes there for Beauty,

449
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:08,692
The three tribes 
try to find the trick.

450
00:23:08,817 --> 00:23:10,632
That's a lot of rice

451
00:23:10,757 --> 00:23:12,976
to pass 
through a very small hole.

452
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:14,502
Here, here!

453
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,829
Beauty brought her first bag.

454
00:23:22,115 --> 00:23:24,579
Cydney has a first bag for Muscles.

455
00:23:25,101 --> 00:23:27,407
When wet, the bags 
are even heavier.

456
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,477
Beauty is doing a good job, 
they have their second bag.

457
00:23:30,602 --> 00:23:32,779
Peter and Neal 
are on the second sack.

458
00:23:32,904 --> 00:23:35,523
Jason and Cydney 
are on the second sack.

459
00:23:37,108 --> 00:23:38,704
Beauty has her third bag!

460
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:41,054
Nick needs to get over it 
and they can move on.

461
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:44,691
Intelligence has its second bag.

462
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:49,274
Second bag for the Muscles, 
they move on to the third.

463
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:51,998
You have to cross the plank 
with the bags

464
00:23:52,123 --> 00:23:53,500
and bring them to the beach.

465
00:23:54,117 --> 00:23:56,336
Third bag for Muscles, 
they are gone!

466
00:23:58,696 --> 00:24:02,751
Peter and Neal are now last, 
for Intelligence.

467
00:24:03,001 --> 00:24:04,705
Tai passed for the Beauty tribe.

468
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,912
Forward, Beauty!

469
00:24:06,037 --> 00:24:07,047
Come on !

470
00:24:07,172 --> 00:24:09,057
Beauty has a nice lead.

471
00:24:09,307 --> 00:24:11,055
Neal passed for Intelligence.

472
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,924
Peter gets on the board.

473
00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:16,374
Tear those bags open! 
There are three balls, one per bag!

474
00:24:16,499 --> 00:24:17,965
That's great !

475
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,026
Nice team work!

476
00:24:20,733 --> 00:24:24,705
Jason runs and succeeds. 
Peter went for Intelligence.

477
00:24:25,945 --> 00:24:27,409
Beauty has two balls.

478
00:24:27,534 --> 00:24:29,014
More than one. They got it !

479
00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:30,737
In the labyrinth, Beauty!

480
00:24:32,297 --> 00:24:33,947
And here comes Intelligence!

481
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,497
The key is to avoid the holes 
in the maze

482
00:24:39,212 --> 00:24:40,762
and get to the top.

483
00:24:41,028 --> 00:24:43,178
Intelligence has its third bag.

484
00:24:43,832 --> 00:24:46,311
We're looking for the third ball 
in the Muscles.

485
00:24:46,436 --> 00:24:48,444
They still haven't 
won a race.

486
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:50,123
They have the third ball.

487
00:24:50,248 --> 00:24:52,000
Take your time, Julia!

488
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:55,275
Julia is halfway through. 
She is looking for the right path.

489
00:24:56,174 --> 00:24:58,898
If you fall off the board, 
you have to start over.

490
00:24:59,023 --> 00:25:01,784
If your ball falls, 
you have to start over.

491
00:25:02,302 --> 00:25:03,678
Cydney becomes feverish.

492
00:25:04,113 --> 00:25:06,715
Julia comes closer.

493
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,516
Go slow, you're there!

494
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:11,486
Julia scores a first point 
for Beauty!

495
00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:13,013
It's Tai's turn for Beauty.

496
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,949
Intelligence 
finally has its three bullets.

497
00:25:16,074 --> 00:25:17,224
Liz steps forward.

498
00:25:18,326 --> 00:25:19,837
Cydney loses her ball again.

499
00:25:19,962 --> 00:25:21,988
- Do you want to trade? 
- Yeah, okay.

500
00:25:23,821 --> 00:25:25,619
Jason comes in for Muscles.

501
00:25:25,744 --> 00:25:28,870
Muscles still hasn't won 
an event in this game.

502
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,220
But Beauty is doing very well.

503
00:25:31,345 --> 00:25:33,558
Tai is close 
with the second ball.

504
00:25:33,683 --> 00:25:35,343
Take it easy, honey, you're there!

505
00:25:35,468 --> 00:25:37,604
Tai places the second 
beauty tribe ball!

506
00:25:37,729 --> 00:25:38,738
More than one!

507
00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:41,249
Caleb steps forward for Beauty.

508
00:25:42,011 --> 00:25:43,510
Liz is very close.

509
00:25:43,635 --> 00:25:45,636
Well done, Liz, great!

510
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:49,215
And There you go ! 
First ball for Intelligence!

511
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:51,293
One point for Intelligence.

512
00:25:51,418 --> 00:25:53,061
Beauty leads with two.

513
00:25:53,311 --> 00:25:54,521
One more time,

514
00:25:54,646 --> 00:25:58,300
Muscles is far behind 
in an event.

515
00:25:58,815 --> 00:26:02,192
Caleb flew over that part of the wall.

516
00:26:02,317 --> 00:26:03,496
It's good, that's it!

517
00:26:03,621 --> 00:26:05,532
He made it all the way 
without firing a shot.

518
00:26:05,948 --> 00:26:08,234
And a new victory 
for the Beauty tribe.

519
00:26:10,221 --> 00:26:12,914
For victory ! 
Caleb, Beauty Tribe!

520
00:26:13,654 --> 00:26:15,501
Immunity and a reward!

521
00:26:15,626 --> 00:26:16,676
Come on Jason!

522
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:18,301
Jason is close.

523
00:26:20,222 --> 00:26:21,390
Come on, let's change!

524
00:26:21,515 --> 00:26:23,892
Jason scores a first point 
for Muscles.

525
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:27,737
are vying for second place.

526
00:26:27,862 --> 00:26:29,146
Tied, 1 - 1.

527
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:31,424
Peter for Intelligence. 
Scot for Muscles.

528
00:26:33,451 --> 00:26:35,265
Peter is close.

529
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:39,724
Peter places the second ball 
for Intelligence.

530
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:41,349
More than one for Intelligence.

531
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,602
Debbie steps forward.

532
00:26:44,094 --> 00:26:46,139
Scot is close for Muscles

533
00:26:46,264 --> 00:26:48,116
with their second ball.

534
00:26:50,477 --> 00:26:52,687
And it's done, equality! 
2 - 2!

535
00:26:54,551 --> 00:26:57,225
It's all happening now. 
Debbie versus Cydney.

536
00:26:58,162 --> 00:27:00,184
Intelligence 
did not go to the council.

537
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:01,955
They don't want to go tonight.

538
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,320
Cydney wasn't very lucky 
the first time around.

539
00:27:06,303 --> 00:27:07,969
Jason helps her a lot.

540
00:27:08,428 --> 00:27:09,429
Come on, Debbie!

541
00:27:09,554 --> 00:27:11,854
Debbie is right in front of Cydney.

542
00:27:11,979 --> 00:27:14,709
Intelligence 
is just ahead of Muscles.

543
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:16,997
- Debbie, it's okay! 
- At the top ! At the top !

544
00:27:17,629 --> 00:27:19,105
Nice shot from Cydney.

545
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,349
It's neck and neck, 
perfect equality!

546
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:22,814
Go left. You hold it!

547
00:27:22,939 --> 00:27:24,876
The 2 women 
are in the last section.

548
00:27:25,001 --> 00:27:26,168
At the top ! To the left !

549
00:27:26,293 --> 00:27:27,580
At the top ! To the left !

550
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:31,551
which now leads to Muscles!

551
00:27:32,452 --> 00:27:34,354
Muscles has never been so close!

552
00:27:35,255 --> 00:27:36,777
Sydney is close!

553
00:27:36,902 --> 00:27:38,291
Debbie is losing ground!

554
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,592
Is this the end?

555
00:27:40,685 --> 00:27:41,995
She's not there yet!

556
00:27:42,564 --> 00:27:45,165
Debbie is getting closer, 
she is just below!

557
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:48,268
It's neck and neck, 
the last seconds!

558
00:27:48,902 --> 00:27:50,804
She is there! 
Sydney, close!

559
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:52,305
Debbie, close!

560
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,383
Muscles succeeds!

561
00:27:55,813 --> 00:27:58,452
A few seconds before Intelligence,

562
00:27:58,888 --> 00:28:01,296
sending Intelligence to the council,

563
00:28:01,523 --> 00:28:05,360
where someone will be 
the third person eliminated from the game.

564
00:28:06,068 --> 00:28:07,354
Three bloody seconds!

565
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:12,867
It was time 
for something to work for us!

566
00:28:15,872 --> 00:28:17,639
Beauty, once again!

567
00:28:18,056 --> 00:28:19,675
Unvoted.

568
00:28:23,634 --> 00:28:26,634
Muscles is a 
new experience for you.

569
00:28:28,775 --> 00:28:30,154
Beauty, the choice is yours.

570
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:33,947
It is very clear: comfort or love.

571
00:28:35,024 --> 00:28:36,025
Comfort !

572
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,884
Come get it, go back to camp.

573
00:28:39,652 --> 00:28:41,302
No advice tonight.

574
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,558
come get your emotional items

575
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:48,327
and rejoice that you 
don't see me in the council.

576
00:28:48,452 --> 00:28:49,863
For the first time !

577
00:28:49,988 --> 00:28:51,464
Jason and his teddy!

578
00:28:51,589 --> 00:28:52,989
I have a teddy!

579
00:28:54,034 --> 00:28:56,248
Intelligence, 
for the 1st time: advice,

580
00:28:56,373 --> 00:28:59,437
where someone will be 
the 3rd person eliminated from the game

581
00:28:59,562 --> 00:29:02,019
and the first person 
eliminated from your tribe.

582
00:29:02,144 --> 00:29:04,688
Take your things, return to camp. 
See you tonight at the council.

583
00:29:05,295 --> 00:29:08,007
We lost the race, 
but no worries.

584
00:29:08,132 --> 00:29:11,271
Now Liz and I are going to 
take out the mafia-style intruders.

585
00:29:11,396 --> 00:29:13,009
And the first will be Neal.

586
00:29:13,134 --> 00:29:15,188
Gambling is gambling, 
money is money.

587
00:29:15,477 --> 00:29:17,227
Survivor is Survivor.

588
00:29:24,522 --> 00:29:27,142
All in all, guys, 
great job.

589
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:29,744
I was three seconds away from her.

590
00:29:29,994 --> 00:29:32,881
Yes, it came to nothing. 
We didn't explode mid-flight.

591
00:29:33,826 --> 00:29:36,049
At the long-term level,

592
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:38,378
this defeat serves us, 
Peter and me,

593
00:29:38,648 --> 00:29:40,675
because we can eliminate Neal.

594
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,426
Neal is the one who would cause 
trouble later on.

595
00:29:44,551 --> 00:29:48,363
We're gonna have to tell Aubry and Neal 
that Joe is leaving tonight.

596
00:29:48,488 --> 00:29:51,696
But the real plan 
is that the remaining four

597
00:29:51,821 --> 00:29:54,294
will split their votes 
between Neal and Aubry,

598
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,429
in case Neal has an idol.

599
00:29:56,963 --> 00:30:00,742
The idea is to simplify the process 
for Joe and Debbie.

600
00:30:00,867 --> 00:30:03,588
They just have to write "Neal", 
remember that Neal is the target.

601
00:30:03,713 --> 00:30:05,805
They will have nothing complicated 
to consider.

602
00:30:09,711 --> 00:30:11,186
Our plan will work

603
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:13,262
if you and joe vote for neal

604
00:30:13,832 --> 00:30:15,682
and Peter and I for Aubry.

605
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:18,809
So if Neal doesn't have the idol,

606
00:30:18,934 --> 00:30:21,125
we will have a tie 2 - 2 - 2.

607
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,928
And in the vote, we vote Neal.

608
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:26,300
I'm confident everything will work out 
as expected.

609
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:28,809
Losing this trial 
will actually prove beneficial.

610
00:30:28,934 --> 00:30:30,141
Well !

611
00:30:30,266 --> 00:30:31,354
Liz approaches me.

612
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:33,800
She wants me and Joe 
to vote for Neal

613
00:30:33,925 --> 00:30:36,578
and followed orders, 
like good soldiers.

614
00:30:37,694 --> 00:30:38,919
It will not arrive.

615
00:30:39,044 --> 00:30:41,631
I'm glad we're 
on the same wavelength.

616
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,456
Let's not discuss it too much.

617
00:30:43,581 --> 00:30:45,956
For me, it's settled.

618
00:30:46,081 --> 00:30:47,696
- It is all good. 
- Yes, we know...

619
00:30:47,821 --> 00:30:49,933
When they take me on a boat,

620
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:52,118
I can reciprocate the 
power of ten.

621
00:30:52,243 --> 00:30:55,317
The fact is 
that she is totally oblivious

622
00:30:55,442 --> 00:30:57,624
of the reality of what is happening.

623
00:30:58,044 --> 00:30:59,556
They vote for Aubry.

624
00:31:00,354 --> 00:31:01,828
They think you have the idol.

625
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:05,865
I now know that Liz and Peter

626
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,577
whisper little lies

627
00:31:08,702 --> 00:31:11,174
to pretend that I have an idol.

628
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:13,373
Accordingly, 
they must be punished.

629
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:20,847
We agree, 
all four, to vote Joe?

630
00:31:20,972 --> 00:31:23,216
- We have to keep our strength. 
- Yeah, I know.

631
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:25,418
Let's do what needs to be done.

632
00:31:26,727 --> 00:31:30,924
Liz and I are beautiful and smiling, 
but we'll be merciless.

633
00:31:31,524 --> 00:31:34,369
The others 
are clay in our hands.

634
00:31:34,494 --> 00:31:36,963
They are unable to decide

635
00:31:37,088 --> 00:31:39,715
you have to guide them, like a father.

636
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:42,680
And I'm the father 
who will guide their vote

637
00:31:42,805 --> 00:31:44,671
in the direction I want.

638
00:31:44,796 --> 00:31:46,339
It's a great position.

639
00:31:47,593 --> 00:31:48,926
But Neal and you,

640
00:31:49,051 --> 00:31:51,678
you need to communicate better 
with Liz and me.

641
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,190
This is new to me, I guess.

642
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,425
Peter wants to control everything.

643
00:31:57,675 --> 00:32:01,577
I can't trust 
someone who reveals himself to me,

644
00:32:01,702 --> 00:32:03,656
every day, 
as soon as he opens his mouth.

645
00:32:04,353 --> 00:32:07,260
He has no 
emotional intelligence

646
00:32:07,648 --> 00:32:10,739
and I don't think 
we can move forward with him.

647
00:32:11,685 --> 00:32:14,361
Debbie basically 
decided to target Liz.

648
00:32:14,486 --> 00:32:17,563
But for me, 
Peter is more dangerous.

649
00:32:17,801 --> 00:32:20,273
I want to talk to Debbie about it 
and make a decision.

650
00:32:24,926 --> 00:32:26,613
Peter said something like:

651
00:32:28,348 --> 00:32:30,025
Stop trying to control me!

652
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,951
Does he have a problem with women?

653
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:34,637
- Nope. He's egotistical... 
- Or is it with everyone?

654
00:32:34,762 --> 00:32:37,457
...arrogant and narcissistic. Yeah.

655
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:40,060
I don't like bullies.

656
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:43,685
My biggest regret 
would be if we took Peter too far

657
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:44,964
and fuck us.

658
00:32:45,498 --> 00:32:47,310
Do we get rid of Peter?

659
00:32:47,435 --> 00:32:48,835
That's the question.

660
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,141
We still have a target: Liz.

661
00:32:51,266 --> 00:32:55,183
But Peter plays 
with too much exuberance.

662
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:57,240
He is narcissistic

663
00:32:57,365 --> 00:32:58,753
egotistical

664
00:32:58,878 --> 00:33:02,278
and ultimately a real problem 
for the Intelligence tribe.

665
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:07,095
Liz and Peter will slit anyone's throat

666
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,753
without the slightest hesitation.

667
00:33:08,878 --> 00:33:10,625
So it's a big decision.

668
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:14,669
But tonight's elimination 
will be a total surprise

669
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:18,217
and it won't be pretty 
when we get home, kids!

670
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:23,385
Total surprise.

671
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,178
Behind you, torches.

672
00:33:44,303 --> 00:33:46,961
Take one 
and light it in the fire.

673
00:33:54,325 --> 00:33:56,444
It is part 
of the council ritual,

674
00:33:56,569 --> 00:33:59,372
because the fire represents your life.

675
00:33:59,751 --> 00:34:00,982
If he disappears

676
00:34:01,232 --> 00:34:02,342
you too.

677
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,345
In a group that does not know each other,

678
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,847
some get along, 
others maybe not.

679
00:34:08,191 --> 00:34:11,009
Have you seen friendships 
formed quickly?

680
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:14,347
Absolutely. From the start, 
things stuck between Liz and me.

681
00:34:14,472 --> 00:34:17,361
Aubry and Neal 
also got along well.

682
00:34:17,486 --> 00:34:20,360
There's an age difference 
between Debbie and Joe,

683
00:34:20,908 --> 00:34:22,629
but as the days go by,

684
00:34:22,754 --> 00:34:24,343
we all got along well.

685
00:34:24,468 --> 00:34:28,942
Does this mean that three duos 
will vote the same way tonight?

686
00:34:29,502 --> 00:34:31,905
Yes, I see that 
as three voting units.

687
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:34,629
Is it fair to consider,

688
00:34:34,754 --> 00:34:36,142
for the Intelligence tribe,

689
00:34:36,267 --> 00:34:38,520
that everything is mathematical,

690
00:34:38,645 --> 00:34:39,794
pragmatic?

691
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:42,160
- Debbie, you're already nodding. 
- Absolutely.

692
00:34:42,285 --> 00:34:44,451
We are excessively analytical.

693
00:34:44,576 --> 00:34:46,962
We know it's better to get 
the facts,

694
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:48,688
examine them without panicking,

695
00:34:48,813 --> 00:34:50,332
reassess, reanalyze,

696
00:34:50,457 --> 00:34:52,934
and that emotions are 
just a waste of time and energy.

697
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:56,825
Or else, everyone thinks 
they are the smartest and quiet.

698
00:34:57,174 --> 00:34:59,674
Aubry, 
which is truer?

699
00:34:59,924 --> 00:35:02,878
You are all very analytical 
and leave emotions aside

700
00:35:03,128 --> 00:35:05,913
or do you all think you 
have it all figured out?

701
00:35:06,038 --> 00:35:07,374
We are in troubled waters.

702
00:35:07,499 --> 00:35:08,984
You can have the majority

703
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:11,511
and feel fully confident,

704
00:35:11,769 --> 00:35:15,090
but there are comments 
or silences,

705
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,125
and you should also know

706
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:20,028
what they mean, 
even if they are not numbers.

707
00:35:21,279 --> 00:35:23,665
Aubry talks about capturing the subtleties

708
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,725
social interactions.

709
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:27,127
All done.

710
00:35:27,252 --> 00:35:28,769
As an emergency physician,

711
00:35:28,894 --> 00:35:31,064
I am a pro 
at social interactions.

712
00:35:34,427 --> 00:35:37,045
Liz, let's talk about paranoia.

713
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,634
She settles in every tribe 
at some point.

714
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:42,113
Does it already exist 
in the Intelligence tribe?

715
00:35:42,238 --> 00:35:44,511
"Paranoia" is a bit strong.

716
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:49,889
But whoever here doesn't fear 
a plot to eliminate him

717
00:35:50,143 --> 00:35:53,061
probably doesn't think 
enough about the game.

718
00:35:54,312 --> 00:35:57,832
To pick up on what Liz said, 
that there is a degree of paranoia:

719
00:35:57,957 --> 00:36:00,627
does your past career come 
into play?

720
00:36:01,962 --> 00:36:03,730
I am always suspicious.

721
00:36:03,855 --> 00:36:07,242
I'm always suspicious 
of people's motives

722
00:36:07,492 --> 00:36:08,812
and that kind of stuff.

723
00:36:08,937 --> 00:36:10,003
Often,

724
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:12,172
people are smiling, 
looking good,

725
00:36:12,451 --> 00:36:14,494
seem believable, 
but are not.

726
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:16,076
That could be the case here.

727
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:19,554
Peter, that's a 
pretty interesting statement.

728
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:21,890
You can't trust 
appearances here.

729
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:23,920
But I trust appearances.

730
00:36:24,045 --> 00:36:25,452
Joe is a policeman.

731
00:36:25,577 --> 00:36:27,582
He spent 25 years at the FBI.

732
00:36:27,707 --> 00:36:29,164
So whatever he tells me,

733
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:30,290
I believe him.

734
00:36:30,415 --> 00:36:34,102
I would just mention 
that the 1st Intelligence/Muscles/Beauty

735
00:36:34,352 --> 00:36:37,768
was won by Tony, 
also a policeman,

736
00:36:37,893 --> 00:36:39,799
who lied every half hour.

737
00:36:40,412 --> 00:36:41,468
I agree.

738
00:36:41,593 --> 00:36:43,919
And I think Joe 
is from another generation.

739
00:36:44,044 --> 00:36:45,847
His word carries more weight to me

740
00:36:45,972 --> 00:36:47,407
than that of a Tony.

741
00:36:48,842 --> 00:36:51,778
Peter, what was the atmosphere 
on the camp after the defeat?

742
00:36:51,903 --> 00:36:53,303
We were very bad.

743
00:36:53,613 --> 00:36:55,270
But I reassured myself

744
00:36:55,395 --> 00:36:57,250
telling me 
that the plan was in motion.

745
00:36:58,067 --> 00:37:00,486
Neal, when a team member says:

746
00:37:00,611 --> 00:37:02,155
"The plan is in place.",

747
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,533
unless you're part of the plan, 
that must make you...

748
00:37:06,216 --> 00:37:08,361
The question is: 
what plan is he talking about?

749
00:37:09,621 --> 00:37:11,539
Well, that's not your plan.

750
00:37:17,494 --> 00:37:19,648
- To fart. 
- Let's be clear.

751
00:37:19,773 --> 00:37:23,051
The guy with the "ice cream" cap 
could be a cap snake.

752
00:37:23,176 --> 00:37:24,177
Is not it ?

753
00:37:24,302 --> 00:37:27,097
So that's the plan. 
If we want to take out Neal or Aubry,

754
00:37:27,222 --> 00:37:30,025
one can split the votes and move 
forward as an Intelligence.

755
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,893
Debbie. Peter, bluntly,

756
00:37:32,018 --> 00:37:33,960
dictates what he wants to see happen.

757
00:37:34,459 --> 00:37:36,690
It does him good to 
expose everything like this.

758
00:37:40,351 --> 00:37:44,205
Do you think tonight's vote 
will go according to plan?

759
00:37:44,455 --> 00:37:48,405
I don't think the person who leaves 
will be totally shocked.

760
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,137
Neal, how about you?

761
00:37:50,262 --> 00:37:52,505
What do you think will be 
the outcome of the vote?

762
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,940
What are you hoping for?

763
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:56,209
I think the tribe 
will come out stronger.

764
00:37:56,334 --> 00:37:59,721
What "reinforced" means... 
will be interpreted later.

765
00:38:02,126 --> 00:38:04,517
Peter, this self-awareness 
is essential.

766
00:38:04,642 --> 00:38:06,004
Oh yeah, absolutely.

767
00:38:06,129 --> 00:38:08,496
One thing I know 
is that I love all these people.

768
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:10,623
I respect 
some of their strategies.

769
00:38:10,748 --> 00:38:12,634
But at this key moment in the game,

770
00:38:12,759 --> 00:38:13,908
there are three duets.

771
00:38:14,033 --> 00:38:15,328
So what do you want?

772
00:38:15,453 --> 00:38:17,964
Liz and I are smart. 
We have thought of everything.

773
00:38:18,089 --> 00:38:19,090
Wow.

774
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:21,935
I just want to take this parchment 
and write names on it.

775
00:38:23,495 --> 00:38:25,472
- Shall we go to the vote? 
- We are ready.

776
00:38:25,597 --> 00:38:27,396
- We are ready. 
- Fine, let's go.

777
00:38:27,521 --> 00:38:28,861
It's time to vote.

778
00:38:28,986 --> 00:38:30,186
Aubrey, over to you.

779
00:38:46,888 --> 00:38:49,070
The world doesn't revolve around you.

780
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,970
But good luck.

781
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:06,980
I will count the votes.

782
00:39:14,879 --> 00:39:17,590
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

783
00:39:17,715 --> 00:39:19,359
now is the time to do it.

784
00:39:22,595 --> 00:39:24,889
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

785
00:39:25,014 --> 00:39:27,367
The eliminated person 
will leave the board immediately.

786
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:28,868
I will read the votes.

787
00:39:31,216 --> 00:39:32,416
First vote:

788
00:39:36,201 --> 00:39:37,202
Aubry.

789
00:39:42,705 --> 00:39:43,950
To fart. Equality.

790
00:39:44,075 --> 00:39:46,161
Two votes Aubry, two votes Peter.

791
00:39:50,014 --> 00:39:51,658
Liz. Upvote Liz.

792
00:39:51,783 --> 00:39:53,034
Two votes Peter,

793
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,369
two Aubry votes,

794
00:39:54,494 --> 00:39:55,729
one vote remains.

795
00:39:59,357 --> 00:40:02,010
Liz. 
We have a three-way tie.

796
00:40:04,771 --> 00:40:06,406
So we're going to vote again.

797
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,013
Aubry, Liz, Peter, 
you won't vote.

798
00:40:10,138 --> 00:40:12,812
The others, you can only vote 
for one of these three.

799
00:40:12,937 --> 00:40:14,377
Joe, come get the ballot box.

800
00:40:40,407 --> 00:40:41,908
I'll get the votes.

801
00:40:49,426 --> 00:40:50,784
I will read the votes.

802
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,520
First vote:

803
00:41:03,254 --> 00:41:06,775
Third person eliminated 
from Intelligence vs. Muscles vs. Beauty.

804
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,437
Liz, that's two, that's enough. 
Bring me your torch.

805
00:41:09,562 --> 00:41:12,105
- Really sorry. 
- Do not worry. Hang on.

806
00:41:14,215 --> 00:41:15,875
You, then!

807
00:41:22,117 --> 00:41:23,758
Liz, the tribe has spoken.

808
00:41:29,089 --> 00:41:30,290
Good luck to everyone !

809
00:41:37,155 --> 00:41:41,300
With all the talk tonight 
about the intelligence of this tribe,

810
00:41:41,425 --> 00:41:44,967
the vote illustrates 
that Survivor still rests

811
00:41:45,092 --> 00:41:47,014
on emotional intelligence,

812
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:50,062
your ability to pick 
up on social cues.

813
00:41:50,187 --> 00:41:51,778
That's what brings you to the end.

814
00:41:51,903 --> 00:41:54,489
Take your torches, 
return to camp. Good night.

Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

819
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:14,335
Next time in Survivor...

820
00:42:15,537 --> 00:42:17,894
Survivor's most grueling season ...

821
00:42:18,504 --> 00:42:19,981
The exhaustion shows.

822
00:42:20,106 --> 00:42:21,111
Doctor !

823
00:42:21,236 --> 00:42:23,051
...continues to do damage.

824
00:42:23,176 --> 00:42:25,466
- We need water! Some water ! 
- Oh my God !

825
00:42:25,591 --> 00:42:27,769
Physiological serum, 
in the refrigerated box!

826
00:42:27,894 --> 00:42:30,150
We will evacuate it! 
Call the helicopter!

827
00:42:32,388 --> 00:42:33,946
I was pretty sure that,

828
00:42:34,071 --> 00:42:36,828
whether we win or lose, 
I'll be calm.

829
00:42:36,953 --> 00:42:39,631
I really don't know what happened

830
00:42:39,756 --> 00:42:42,223
so that my tribe wants to eliminate me.

831
00:42:42,348 --> 00:42:44,401
I don't think 
the numbers lied to me.

832
00:42:44,526 --> 00:42:46,239
These are the people who lied to me.

833
00:42:46,364 --> 00:42:49,487
And when we add 
up fictitious promises,

834
00:42:49,612 --> 00:42:51,570
we obtain a fictitious total.
