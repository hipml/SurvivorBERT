>> JEFF: Previously on<i> Survivor:</i>

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,754
Sparks flew between Kimmi and
Alicia.

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:05,672
>> KIMMI: Don't wave your finger
in my face.

4
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:07,590
>> ALICIA: I will always wave my
finger...

5
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,426
>> KIMMI: What have I said about
the chickens, though, nothing!

6
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,094
>> ALICIA: I'm tired of and you
the (<i> bleep</i> ) chickens!

7
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,304
(<i> bird squawks</i> )
>> JEFF: Ogakor had their own

8
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,056
problems-- they kept losing
challenges.

9
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,891
>> AMBER: I'm so tired of
losing.

10
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,769
>> JEFF: But a pep talk from
Colby fired up the troops.

11
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,605
>> COLBY: It is going to take
every ounce of strength.

12
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,774
It is going to be one hell of a
show today.

13
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,609
>> JEFF: Survivors ready!
Go!

14
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,236
>> Get it.
>> Where is it? Here it is.

15
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:30,321
>> JEFF: After a long losing
streak, Ogakor rebounded and

16
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,158
regained the immunity idol.
>> TINA: We're out.

17
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:35,452
(<i> screaming happily</i> )
>> JEFF: So Kucha made the hike

18
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,288
to Tribal Council.
Next vote, Kimmi.

19
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,666
The tribe has spoken.
Eleven remain.

20
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:51,760
Who will be voted out tonight?
(<i> thunder crashing</i> )

21
00:00:51,843 --> 00:01:51,319
Who will be voted out tonight?
(<i> thunder crashing</i> )

22
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:55,824
>> ALICIA: Wow, you guys.
>> ELISABETH: Oh, my God.

23
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:58,034
Did we find the matches?
(<i> thunder crashing, rain</i>

24
00:01:58,117 --> 00:02:01,746
<i>pouring</i> )
>> RODGER: The rain, yes.

25
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,249
We got to Tribal Council last
night, hadn't been there

26
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:07,377
probably five minutes, I guess,
and then all of a sudden, here

27
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,380
comes... the heaviest rain we've
had since we've been here.

28
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,215
I mean, it really came down.
Put our fire out.

29
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:16,845
So then we had to use one of our
matches to light a candle in our

30
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,888
hut.
Got the candles going and

31
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,100
searched through and found the
very warmest, well, not the

32
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,936
warmest, but really the driest
clothes that we had.

33
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:28,231
A lot of us had wore our clothes
to Tribal Council that we'd been

34
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,900
used to sleeping in.
I know I did, for one.

35
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,070
That was a mistake.
(<i> thunder crashing</i> )

36
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:35,238
>> ELISABETH: Oh, my God!
This is crazy.

37
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,866
Is that coming in from the
outside?

38
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:41,119
>> JEFF V.: Yeah, I think it is.
>> ELISABETH: Oh!

39
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,412
>> JEFF V.: Oh, my God.
It's coming in hard.

40
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:48,251
This is going to suck.
>> ELISABETH: When it rains

41
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,254
here, it means you're cold at
night, you don't sleep.

42
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:59,429
Rain is... I mean, it puts you
in such an extreme disadvantage.

43
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,598
It's... it takes you a day to
recover from rain.

44
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,267
I mean, there's a risk of
getting sick, you're sleeping in

45
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,936
the cold, wet.
There's nothing worse than the

46
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,813
rain here.
(<i> thunder crashing</i> )

47
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,816
Nothing worse.
'Cause being cold is guaranteed

48
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,776
at night.
But cold and wet?

49
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,948
Stick a fork in me.
It stinks.

50
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,076
>> JEFF V.: Good night, Jim Bob.
(<i> scattered chuckling</i> )

51
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,122
>> ALICIA (<i> chuckles</i> ): Shut up.
"Jim Bob."

52
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,290
(<i> thunder crashing, rain</i>
<i>pouring</i> )

53
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,418
>> JEFF V.: I love this place.
You gotta love it.

54
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:41,012
(<i> thunder echoing</i> )
>> MICHAEL: It's amazing how you

55
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:45,683
can live off the land, eight
city people can come out here

56
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,477
and live off the land.
It's amazing.

57
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,649
Not only food wise, but shelter
wise and safety wise, and, um,

58
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:56,110
heat wise.
And starting a fire this morning

59
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:59,447
with wet wood.
It's just amazing to me.

60
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,368
It's a whole... my outlook on
life has changed 180 degrees.

61
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:08,539
And I'm this kind of guy.
I'm this kind... you know, this

62
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,668
should be nothing for me.
But, uh, I am a changed man

63
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,879
already, after 16 days.
Very changed.

64
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:21,177
And if I last another 16 days,
who knows what's going to happen

65
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,182
to me.
>> ALICIA: Today is day 16.

66
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:31,020
We are thinking ahead now to,
uh, the merger.

67
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,064
We have four more days until
that happens.

68
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,525
>> JEFF V.: We started with 16
people.

69
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,361
Six people are voted out of the
outback.

70
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,447
Then when it gets to ten people,
everybody comes together into

71
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,367
one tribe and the game, all of a
sudden, becomes every man for

72
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,661
himself.
>> NICK: There's one more

73
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,580
immunity challenge left, we have
six and they have five, and, uh,

74
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:54,252
that's a huge advantage because
the pressure is on them to win

75
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,588
the next challenge, and, uh,
we're really hoping to go into

76
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:01,884
the merger six to four, and that
way we could basically pick them

77
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:07,724
off one by one.
>> JEFF V.: We are a very cocky

78
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,059
group.
It's fun to beat them and make

79
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,396
fun of it.
It's fun to have them talk about

80
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,566
how hungry they are, and us go
in there and win all their food.

81
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:24,532
That's fun!
>> AMBER: Oh, my God, I'm so

82
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:27,785
hungry.
>> JERRI: There's enough in here

83
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,579
for...
>> AMBER: I'd say three

84
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,040
tortillas.
>> JERRI: Yeah, I could get

85
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,542
three tortillas out of that, but
I'd say we go two.

86
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,921
>> AMBER: Oh, my God.
(<i> Jerri laughs softly</i> )

87
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,049
And to think the other tribe is
eating eggs.

88
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:44,469
>> JERRI: Bastards.
And soup, and spices.

89
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:49,265
>> AMBER: And chicken, and pig.
>> JERRI: I just, at some point,

90
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:54,270
have to get my hands on some
chocolate.

91
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:57,940
I fear I might go psycho.
And I'm not kidding.

92
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,902
I had a discussion with Colby
regarding chocolate and how

93
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:05,615
chocolate releases the same
endorphins that sex does, and

94
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:10,161
since none of us are having sex,
that that's probably why we keep

95
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,662
reverting to the chocolate
discussions.

96
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:18,419
I'm going to bathe myself in
chocolate.

97
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,297
>> AMBER: I can't get over... I
just want to bite into one of

98
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,801
those so bad, it's unbelievable.
Like a peppermint patty.

99
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:28,805
>> JERRI: Right now, I can
actually, in my wildest fantasy,

100
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,934
picture pouring hot chocolate
all over...

101
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:37,021
some hot dude's bod and having
sex while licking it off at the

102
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,982
same time.
That's like my ultimate fantasy

103
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,692
right now.
>> AMBER: It's like when you

104
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:46,489
pull apart the chocolate...
(<i> Jerri squeals in frustration</i> )

105
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,117
(<i> Amber laughs softly</i> )
>> COLBY: When you're asleep at

106
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,828
night in the tent, and you hear
moaning and groaning about

107
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,539
Hershey Kisses, you know
what's really going on though.

108
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,667
It ain't about the chocolate.
>> JERRI: Vanilla ice cream...

109
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,794
>> AMBER: Oh, my God.
>> JERRI: ...with hot fudge

110
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,504
trickled all over the top!
>> AMBER: Yes!

111
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:05,216
(<i> both scream happily</i> )
>> COLBY: She's using her

112
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,468
thoughts of chocolate to
substitute for her thoughts of

113
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,428
sex.
It's just making for a very

114
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,181
uncomfortable camping trip.
>> AMBER: Peppermint Pattie!

115
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,225
>> JERRI: I think Colby's
afraid of me.

116
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,894
Because this fantasy I have
about chocolate and sex

117
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,646
definitely involves him.
Oh, God, I can't take.

118
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:24,068
I can't take it anymore!
>> COLBY: I may be a lot of

119
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,070
things, but I ain't no Hershey
bar.

120
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,991
(<i> laughing</i> )
>> JERRI: Snickers!

121
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,701
>> AMBER: Kit Kat, Milky Way,
M&Ms!

122
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:36,747
Reese's Cup!
A meatball sub!

123
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,375
>> JERRI: Oh, yeah!
I love those!

124
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,335
>> COLBY: This is ridiculous
man.

125
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,254
They're driving me nuts.
(<i> girls yelling, bongo playing</i> )

126
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:46,799
Bring on... get rid of
these goons, and let's get

127
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:47,842
something going.
This is crazy.

128
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:54,724
(<i> Jerri laughing</i> )
>> AMBER: Oh, my God!

129
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,559
>> COLBY: Hey, girls, guess
what's for dinner?

130
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,894
(<i> Jerri laughs</i> )
>> BOTH: Rice.

131
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,395
>> COLBY: We're having white
rice.

132
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:04,275
(<i> both moan</i> )
(<i> bongo plays</i> )

133
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:24,712
(<i> chicken clucks softly</i> )
>> ELISABETH: Chicken feed, huh?

134
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:25,755
>> RODGER: I really don't think
there's a thing in there that

135
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,716
will hurt you.
>> ELISABETH: I think it would

136
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,427
probably be better cooked, we
know it's clean... after I eat a

137
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,763
handful.
I just wonder if it's been,

138
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,558
like, stepped on and stuff by
other chickens, and...

139
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,768
>> RODGER: Well, if it's
cooked...

140
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,937
>> ALICIA: That's good,
actually.

141
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:49,737
>> ELISABETH: Actually, not bad.
(<i> Michael speaks indistinctly</i> )

142
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:55,618
>> ALICIA: Chicken feed.
We bring back the chicken, the

143
00:08:55,701 --> 00:09:02,291
rooster, the chicken feed, and
of course, in true Kucha style,

144
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,586
we're trying to figure out how
we can utilize every single

145
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,423
little thing we brought back.
Elisabeth and I said, "Can we

146
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,801
eat that?"
Because it just looks like nuts

147
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:16,973
and grains and corn and wheat,
and, you know, it just looks so

148
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,809
good to us for some reason.
And he told us, you know, he's

149
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:23,479
like, "Yeah, it's good for you."
>> MICHAEL: Ow, ow, ow, ow.

150
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:24,689
Yeow.
You guys, it's popping.

151
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:29,443
You guys should see this stuff.
It's popping like popcorn.

152
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,321
You guys, come here quick.
It is popcorn!

153
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,950
It's popcorn!
It's cracking, it's popping.

154
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,827
>> ALICIA: Can you believe that?
It is popcorn.

155
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,872
It's popcorn.
There's popcorn in this pan.

156
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,833
This camp just gets better and
better every minute.

157

Ow.

158

00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:55,177
this chicken pop feed, whatever.
I just... I don't know.

160
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,014
It's good, and I hated it, the
whole thought of eating chicken

161
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,684
feed just made me sick.
But the more I eat it, the

162
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,894
better it gets.
>> ALICIA: Do you love it?

163
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,814
>> JEFF V.: Oh, my God.
>> ALICIA: That just, we--

164
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,691
forget it.
We are now addicted.

165
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:12,320
It's so good.
>> MICHAEL: Oh, my gosh.

166
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,363
>> ALICIA: And we have, like,
chicken popcorn.

167
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,073
We wake up in the morning, we
make it.

168
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,200
After we eat breakfast, in the
afternoon, we make it.

169
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,578
(<i> thunder crashing</i> )
At night, we make it.

170
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,539
And we're going to find out,
like, somewhere down the road

171
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:26,375
that, like, something was in it,
and we're going to have like

172
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,587
eight nipples and laying eggs,
and I don't know, but until that

173
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,590
happens, I'm going to keep
eating it because it's so good.

174
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:33,841
It's so good.
>> MICHAEL: Let's kill those

175
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,510
chickens so they don't eat any
more feed.

176
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:41,891
(<i> Michael laughing</i> )
(<i> chicken clucking</i> )

177
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,858
>> KEITH: Jerri and Amber went
to pick some tomatoes.

178
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:55,112
Jerri has, um, decided she wants
to do fried green tomatoes, but

179
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,074
they're cherry tomato.
>> JERRI: But I can tantalize

180
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:02,411
our taste buds with fried green
tomatoes this evening.

181
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:06,457
>> AMBER: Getting creative.
>> JERRI: Have to.

182
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,001
>> COLBY: Thank you.
>> JERRI: They aren't quite as

183
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,920
ripe, but...
>> KEITH: You don't do fried

184
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,547
green tomatoes with cherry
tomatoes.

185
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,050
My thought was maybe leave them
on the vine just another couple

186
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,260
days, they'll be nice and bright
red and real juicy and good to

187
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,096
eat.
Another day, those would have

188
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,431
been perfect.
But, uh, doesn't look like

189
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:26,268
that's going to happen.
>> JERRI: Well, it just would

190
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,270
help if you weren't quite so
pessimistic about ideas that

191
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,439
others have other than your own.
>> KEITH: I wasn't pessimistic.

192
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,024
I'm not picking on you about
you tomatoes.

193
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,567
>> JERRI: You already did on the
way here.

194
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,902
You said, "I don't think that
can be done."

195
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,488
>> KEITH: That's good, well,
then this will be good.

196
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,074
We have fried green tomatoes.
>> COLBY: Keith and Jerri, are

197
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,909
just... like two alley cats
scratching with each other.

198
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:45,663
They're fighting over fried
green tomatoes of all things,

199
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,165
and it's ridiculous that the
rest of us have to sit through

200
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,919
all this.
>> JERRI: I don't... yeah, I

201
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:55,005
think it's done yet, Keith.
It looks totally soupy.

202
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:59,468
It needs to sit there till it's
dry.

203
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,471
It's going to be soupy.
>> COLBY: Keith is a chef,

204
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,306
man.
You don't have to insult the guy

205
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,350
by telling him he doesn't know
what he's talking about.

206
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,519
I think it's disrespectful and
rude.

207
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,813
And that's what Jerri loves to
do, because she knows it's going

208
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,024
to ruffle his feathers.
>> JERRI: You got to let the

209
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,025
rice sit.
>> KEITH: You can't.

210
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,986
...sticking to the bottom and
burning.

211
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,071
>> COLBY: It's all breaking up,
though.

212
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,032
>> JERRI: It's 'cause he kept
stirring it.

213
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,493
You've got to leave it in there.
>> TINA: Stop it!

214
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,079
Both of you!
Or you're going to time out.

215
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,707
I'm not their mother.
It's not my position to get in

216
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,875
the middle and send them both to
time out.

217
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,629
But to be honest, I think one of
the problems needs to go.

218
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,174
We can't afford for people not
to get along.

219
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,468
Jerri makes me feel
uncomfortable.

220
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:44,013
You know, you're always walking
on eggshells around her.

221
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:49,518
And it's just no fun living in
that type of situation.

222
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,979
>> KEITH: Another...?
>> COLBY: Oh, yeah!

223
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,939
They're kind of like okra.
They really are kind of like...

224
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,525
>> AMBER: Did you try one?
You didn't like it?

225
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,902
>> TINA: It has a sour... almost
a sour bite to it.

226
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:01,363
>> JERRI: It's 'cause they're
green.

227
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,366
(<i> Jerri chuckles</i> )
>> KEITH: So the fried green

228
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,828
tomatoes sucked.
I knew they would.

229
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,706
Poor Colby stomached all of
them, including mine, told her

230
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:16,212
they were great.
'Cause Colby is a gentleman.

231
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:24,011
But I do not like them.
>> AMBER: What will the reward

232
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,889
be today?
>> JERRI: I don't know.

233
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:30,976
I'm feeling good about it today,
though.

234
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,565
"The next challenge you face is
no walk in the park.

235
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,901
Now we'll find out who's afraid
of the dark!

236
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:42,863
To lead the whole tribe there
can only be one.

237
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,366
The winners will picnic and the
losers get none!"

238
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,035
A picnic!
>> AMBER: Oh, my God!

239
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,704
Like a barbecue!
>> JERRI: Oh, my God.

240
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,581
Oh, my God.
(<i> Jerri screams happily</i> )

241
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,251
Yeah!
Oh, my God!

242
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,962
>> KEITH: This better be good.
>> JERRI: Oh, my God.

243
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:58,963
>> COLBY: Peanut butter and
jelly sandwiches.

244
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,090
>> JERRI: A picnic!
Food!

245
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,926
Can you imagine, like, real
food!

246
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,470
>> AMBER: Sandwiches.
>> JERRI: I can't, oh...

247
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,638
You know there's going to be
dessert.

248
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,933
Tina!
>> TINA: ...and there's food

249
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,435
involved.
>> JERRI: Yes, there is.

250
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,147
>> AMBER: A huge at of food!
>> JERRI: "The winners will

251
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:20,693
picnic and the losers get none!"
>> AMBER: Picnic. A picnic.

252
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,404
>> JERRI: Picnic.
>> TINA: And I am not afraid of

253
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,114
the dark, sister.
(<i> whooping</i> )

254
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,491
>> JEFF V.: I have really good,
uh, vision.

255
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,618
>> ELISABETH: If it's in the
water, we're afraid of the dark.

256
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,120
>> ALICIA: We don't want to be
in the dark.

257
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,913
We're not eat leading... we're
not leading the tribe.

258
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,290
>> ELISABETH: I'll follow.
>> ALICIA: Me, too.

259
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,583
>> MICHAEL: "The winners
will..."

260
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,293
>> JEFF V.: Picnic.
>> ALICIA: Picnic, honey.

261
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,461
>> NICK: We just got you're tree
mail for tonight's reward

262
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,256
challenge.
It sounds like we're going to be

263
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:45,134
doing something at night, almost
definitely, um, and it says "to

264
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,762
lead the whole tribe there can
only be one."

265
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:52,141
Um, so it sounds like one person
will be leading the tribe

266
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,477
through the dark.
You're good, you're good, you're

267
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,771
good.
Okay, toward my voice, toward

268
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,107
my voice, toward my voice.
>> ALICIA: We don't want the

269
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,776
opposition to win the picnic,
because we have a big immunity

270
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,322
challenge tomorrow and, uh, if
they win, it could... it could

271
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,491
give them that little boost, uh,
and we don't want them to have

272
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,619
that.
>> NICK: Towards my voice,

273
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:17,499
towards my voice.
>> JERRI: Definitely.

274
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,668
>> AMBER: Oh, my God, a picnic
is so much better...

275
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:23,172
>> JERRI: There's no mess.
No plucking, no cutting.

276
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,048
>> AMBER: It's already made for
us.

277
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:27,343
>> JERRI: Oh, a bottle of
chardonnay.

278
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,679
A little cheese and crackers.
>> NICK: Uphill a little bit.

279
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,222
Right, right.
To your right a little bit.

280
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:45,486
Right, straight, straight.
>> JERRI: Put your hands above

281

your heads, interlacing your
fingers, pointing to the sky.

282
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:52,701
If Kucha wins this is reward, it
would suck!

283
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,079
(<i> laughs</i> )
They don't deserve it.

284
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,831
They've been eating like kings
over there, and I think it would

285
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,084
be really nice of them if they
threw this one for us.

286
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,711

picnic, picnic...

>> JERRI: Ah... picnic!
>> COLBY: Dinner.

288
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:09,134
It's all about the grub.
>> JERRI: That's right.

289

>> JEFF: Come on in, guys.
How goes it?

290
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,236
>> ALICIA: Good.

291
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,363
you're playing for?
>> JERRI: Yeah!

292
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:34,243
>> AMBER: Yes, yes.
>> JEFF: Give you a little

293
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,954
sample.
One Doritos chip for each tribe.

294
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,540
>> AMBER: Oh! Doritos!
>> TINA: Oh, my gosh.

295
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,709
A Doritos!
>> AMBER: You can have first

296
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,459
bite.
>> ALICIA: Oh, my God.

297
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,754
Take a bite.
>> AMBER: Oh, my God!

298
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,550
Wow!
>> JEFF: One chip and one sip.

299
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:54,430
(<i> Jerri squeals happily</i> )
>> AMBER: Oh, my God!

300
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,432
Something besides water.
>> JERRI: Do the Dew.

301
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,268
>> JEFF: A little Mountain Dew.
>> JERRI: Do the Dew, baby!

302

>> AMBER: Oh, my God.

303
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,940

going.

>> JERRI: Unbelievable!

305
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,447
>> AMBER: Oh, my God.
It's so good.

306
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,866
>> JEFF: Certainly you guys have
figured out to survive out here

307
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,743
you have to be able to trust
each other, to a certain degree

308
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,662
anyway.
Each tribe will select one set

309
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,623
of eyes.
That will be your tribe's

310
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,792
leader.
The rest of the tribe will be

311
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,627
blindfolded.
And it's your leader's

312
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,588
communication skills that are
going to be the name of this

313
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:30,174
game.
Sitting atop two elevated

314
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,260
perches and using only your
voices, the two chosen leaders--

315
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:37,264
Jerri for Ogakor, Nick for
Kucha-- you're going to navigate

316
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,933
your blind tribes through a
series of tasks.

317
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,312
The first tribe to complete all
the tasks wins the reward.

318
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,857
Here's how the course works:
First task involves two logs

319
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,359
and a sawhorse.
You need to get the logs into

320
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,820
the sawhorse.
Your next task: Get to this

321
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,656
table, take this trap, switch it
for the other trap that's in the

322
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,451
water.
When you've completed that,

323
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:00,496
you'll see a series of buckets.
Each member needs to get a

324
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:04,833
bucket, go to the water tower,
fill their bucket with water.

325
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,337
Once it's full, guide them to
the wine barrel, have them dump

326
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,464
their water into the wine
barrel.

327
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:13,884
When the wine barrel overflows,
you move to the final task.

328
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:17,513
That is getting the picnic
basket to the finish table.

329
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:29,066
First tribe to get their basket
on the table wins the reward.

330
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,235
Survivors ready!
Go!

331
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,862
>> NICK: Okay, stay there.
Stay there.

332
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,198
Hold hands and walk straight.
Walk straight.

333
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,367
Stop, stop, stop.
Bend down, bend down...

334
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,828
There's two logs.
No, Mike, stay.

335
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,579
Mike, back up.
There's a log, Jeff, you've got

336
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,039
a...
>> JERRI: Tina, keep going

337
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:44,873
straight.
Keep going straight.

338
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,710
Stop! Stop!
Amber, keep to your left.

339
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:53,048
Towards me, towards me.
Keith and Amber, come forward.

340
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:55,384
The other way.
>> NICK: Walk straight, Alicia.

341
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,677
There you go.
No, no, okay, stop.

342
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,262
>> JERRI: There's a log by your
leg, Colby, you're going to pick

343
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:01,223
it up, pick it up.
There's a sawhorse to your

344
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,559
left, a sawhorse to your left.
You're going to put it on the

345
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,353
sawhorse at both ends.
Amber, Keith, Amber, Keith, go

346
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,606
back, go back.
>> NICK: There you go, there you

347
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,024
go, there you go.
You got one.

348
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,234
Okay, Elisabeth stay there,
there you go.

349
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,028
There you go.
There, stop, drop it, drop it.

350
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,865
>> JERRI: Colby, go the other
side of the sawhorse, go the

351
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,366
other side.
Climb over it if you have to.

352
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,785
There's another log.
You're going to do the same

353
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,412
exact thing.
>> NICK: Okay, walk forward,

354
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,414
walk forward, walk forward.
There you go, there you go...

355
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,292
Walk, two more steps.
Stop, stop, stop.

356
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,459
There's a trap, just like our
fish trap.

357
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:33,255
Grab that, grab that, okay.
>> JERRI: There's a yabby trap

358
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,132
on the table.
>> COLBY: A what?

359
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,467
>> JERRI: A yabby trap.
Grab it, shuffle side step to

360
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,095
your right.
You're going to go in the water,

361
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:41,430
in the water, in the water is
another yabby trap.

362
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,433
Colby, back step.
>> NICK: One step more, one step

363
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:48,729
more, Mike and Elisabeth.
>> JERRI: It's hooked around the

364
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,439
flag.
Go back.

365
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,566
Colby, it's hooked around the
flag.

366
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,527
Lift it up then around.
No, no, no, the other way, the

367
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,695
other way.
No, Colby, down.

368
00:19:56,778 --> 00:20:00,115
(<i> Colby yells</i> )
Colby, underneath, underneath

369
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:01,950
the rope, underneath the rope,
underneath it.

370
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,327
Okay.
Now shuffle, side step, side

371
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,456
step, Tina, to your right.
You're going to go in the water.

372
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,415
>> NICK: Right in front of you
is the table.

373
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,792
Right in front of you is the
table.

374
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,169
Mike, drop the trap on the
table.

375
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,630
There you go, there you go.
Mike, Elisabeth, side step left.

376
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,466
Side step left, side step left.
Side step left, side step left.

377
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,468
Stop, stop, stop.
Forward, Jeff, three steps

378
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,802
forward.
Three steps forward.

379
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,638
Stop, stop, stop.
Take a bucket right in front of

380
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,389
you.
>> JERRI: Up on land, up on

381
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,643
land.
Go backwards, go backwards.

382
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,811
Yabby trap on the table.
On the table.

383
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,855
Set it down.
Come forward, come forward.

384
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,608
Colby stop, reach down.
Um, there's going to be buckets,

385
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,525
there are buckets in front of
you.

386
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,402
Right to your left.
Yeah, grab that bucket.

387
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,697
Tina, there's another bucket.
>> NICK: Everybody, side step

388
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,240

>> Whose left?

389
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,952
(<i> Nick and Jerri shouting</i> )
>> JERRI: Okay, you guys, now,

390
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,204
both of you move forward.
Go forward. Go, go.

391
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,665
You can just keep going.
Keep going back, backwards,

392
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,042
backwards.
There's a silo back there.

393
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,003
There's a hook that you're going
to pull and fill your buckets

394
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,297
with water.
Face to your left then go.

395
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,841
There's a straight open shot.
Keith, go to your right.

396
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,177
Keith, go to your right.
>> COLBY: Jerri!

397

>> JERRI: Move to the right
of the silo.

398
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,555
There you go.
Right above your head, there is

399
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,850
a thing you're going to pull.
Right... no!

Pull it, Colby, pull it.
Pull it, you'll feel water.

There's water-- fill up your
buckets.

407
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,581
Fill up your buckets.

Straight, your hands straight in
the air.

00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,836
There you go, Jeff, grab it.
Now fill the bucket.

410
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,214
Fill the bucket.
Fill the bucket.

411
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,300
Fill the bucket.
>> JERRI: Colby, take your full

Keep heading straight, straight,

00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,388
straight.
You got it, you got it.

414
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,557
There's a thing.
Dump your thing in... dump your

A big tub.
Pour your bucket.

00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,366
Pour your bucket in there.
There you go, there you go.

Okay, bend down.

Everybody.

It is a have-to-win day.
But that's pressure.

challenge today, that means we

will be down four to six.
The other tribe will probably

just pick us off one by one.

thing off today, I don't think
it's over at all.

471
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:19,226
It seems to be the attitude of
everyone to just lay down and

00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,686
die if we don't pull this thing
off.

473
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,731
I'm certainly not going to just
sit around and wait to be picked

474
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:27,317
off by Kucha once we merge.
That's not happening with this

475
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:35,659
kid.
>> JERRI: There's a weird

476
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,662
tension in the camp right now.
Colby wants to just think about

477
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:42,332
nothing but the game, and then
Amber and Tina are braiding each

478
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:45,293
other's hair and talking about
college days.

479
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:50,006
>> AMBER: And it's funny because
in my sophomore year...

480
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,051
>> JERRI: Everybody was kind of
chitchatting and being very

481
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:56,304
lighthearted, and I needed to
get more centered and focused.

482
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,806
>> KEITH: It was around my head,
it catches the back...

483
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,767
>> JERRI: So I knew that I
needed to get away from camp.

484
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,478
>> KEITH: And go like this and
it all like, whoosh, and now

485
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:07,607
it's dark out, and I'm all
tangled in this line and...

486
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:22,831
>> COLBY: Everyone was kind of
going in their different

487
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,125
directions, and I decided just
to come upstream, and think

488
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,835
about the game.
You have to be a lot more

489
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:31,172
selfish when you merge, because
at that point it is all about

490
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,008
getting yourself as far as you
can go.

491
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:37,721
You can't help but think about
what's around the corner.

492
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,893
>> JERRI: Everyone else in the
camp is looking at it as if, if

493
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,688
we lose today, that's it, we're
all going to be sitting ducks,

494
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,857
or we're going to get picked
off one by one.

495
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:53,028
I see it almost as an
opportunity to, uh, finagle my

496
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:58,366
way into the other tribe a bit
and mix things up, and freak

497
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:04,372
some people out.
If they're going to pick us off

498
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,833
one by one, I'm at least going
to cause a big ruckus going

499
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,752
down.
I'm going to wreak a little

500
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:18,845
havoc.
>> MICHAEL: Four bites, two

501
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:29,773
havoc.
>> MICHAEL: Four bites, two

502
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:37,947
fish, that's it.
They died in the tin just as

503
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:41,242
fast as they died anywhere else.
I don't think I put enough water

504
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,287
in it.
I put enough to cover their

505
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,748
backs, but... I don't know if it
got too hot.

506
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:50,251
It was hot out there. Ooh.
>> ALICIA: It is hot.

507
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,795

and popcorn as a snack and then

508
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:55,965
have the fish and rice as a
dinner.

>> MICHAEL: You guys do what's

632
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,850
right.
You guys know what to do.

633
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,268
>> RODGER: Okay.
>> MICHAEL: You guys know what

634
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,479
to do.
You know exactly what to do.

635
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:10,233
ALICIA: How many fish do you
want?

636

disturbing.

646
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:27,536
little strange.
"There has been an accident at

647
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,372
the Kucha camp, and one of their
members has been evacuated.

648
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:32,833

As a result, there will be no

immunity challenge today...
(<i> Amber gasps</i> )

650

...and all five of you will
continue to the merge.

651
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,508
You will receive further
instructions soon."

>> KEITH: Hopefully, they're all

655
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,393
right.
>> AMBER: I wonder that this

656
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,353
means.
Like, I wonder if we...?

657
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,106
If... if they...
>> JERRI: If they have someone

658
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,482
hurt, they have five now, right?
>> AMBER: I hope it's not a

659
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:59,527
snakebite.
I hope it's something that heals

660
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,863
like... a broken... you know.
(<i> Tina moans</i> )

>> JERRI: I think a snakebite
might be better than a broken

00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:05,533
something.
"Evacuated."

663
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:10,997
I mean, that's... that's hard
core.

664
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:26,178
>> ELISABETH: It was... it was
so strange to sit there, and

665
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:29,056
we're all smiling at him, and
he's cracking jokes and it was

666
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,768
so hard, 'cause the minute, you
know, the minute he was out of

667
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,938
sight, it was like decompress
and just, like, oh, gosh, that

668
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:42,737
just happened.
And it just really hit hard.

669
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:47,742
Because it makes you... makes
you realize that...

670
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,452
you're out here for a period of
time with a group of people, and

671
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:53,914
you're doing everything
together, and, you know, you win

672
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:57,752
games, you lose games, you know,
you're sleeping in the same

673
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:01,547
quarters, and one of your
teammates goes down, and for him

674
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:06,719
to ask to see each of us.
I mean, I know at one point he

675
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,721
was like, "Wait, I can't see
Elisabeth."

676
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,723
And I'm... I was, like, behind
someone.

677
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:15,269
I'm like, "I'm right here, Mike.
You know, here I am."

678
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:21,776
And his eyes were just locked on
ours, locked.

679
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,945
>> RODGER: We're going to either
go win this thing or lose this

680
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,824
thing as a team, I think.
I don't think there's... unless

681
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:32,620
somebody jumps boat on us in
mid... in the middle of the

682
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:36,832
stream, which is possible.
Uh, we're either going to stick

683
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:43,964
together as a team, and, uh,
possibly Mike's accident, uh,

684
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,591
might have brought some of them
to the realization that, you

685
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:49,178
know, maybe there's other things
more important than even the

686
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:54,475
million dollars, you know.
>> JEFF V.: This merge is going

687
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,520
to be intense.
Ogakor will be relieved.

688
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:01,524
I think, that they'll... I mean,
I think they're good people, and

689
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:06,487
I think that they're going to
feel bad, and sincerely have

690
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:11,617
compassion for us and for Mike.
But they weren't part of that,

691
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:17,289
they didn't experience it.
They didn't... hear it.

692
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:21,669
And so that feeling of, oh, my
goodness, it's going to have to

693
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,504
be very quickly replaced with
relief.

694
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:27,758
That we're merging together,
'cause we had them.

695
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:31,512
We had them.
They had to have been scared.

696
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,223
They had to have been afraid.
There's no way we were losing

697
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:39,270
this challenge today, no way.
And, um, we're going to... we're

698
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:42,523
going to kill 'em.
We're going to eat 'em up and

699
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,526
spit 'em out, and that's the way
Mike would want it to be.

700
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,195
It was the last thing he said
to us before he left, and it's

701
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:58,247
exactly what we're going to do.
(<i> fire crackling</i> )

702
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:15,764
exactly what we're going to do.
(<i> fire crackling</i> )

703
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,745
>> RODGER: God, we give thee
thanks today for this beautiful

704
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:41,874
Lord's day and for all thy many
wonderful blessings.

705
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,584
We thank thee, dear Lord, for
this food, which Mike caught for

706
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,837
us today, and we pray dear Lord
that you will be with him as he

707
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:50,549
undergoes surgery.
We pray that you will be with

708
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:52,801
the doctors.
Give them the knowledge and the

709
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:58,599
experience and the wisdom to fix
his hands so that they will be

710
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:03,729
once again returned to normal.
We just pray that you will be

711
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:08,234
with him, be with his family,
and we just ask that you would

712
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,945
bless them and give them
strength.

713
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:14,406
And we would ask, dear Lord,
that you would also bless the

714
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,993
ones remaining here in this
group, and ask that you would be

715
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:21,789
with us and give us your
guidance and also your strength

716
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,666
and your support.
In your son's holy name we ask

717
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,668
it. Amen.
>> ELISABETH: Amen.

718
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:35,803
>> JEFF: Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode and hear

719
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:40,474
what Michael has to say.
Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>

720
00:42:40,557 --> 00:42:42,768
>> JERRI: We're moving!
>> JEFF: Due to Michael's

721
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:45,479
accident, Kucha and Ogakor will
merge with five members each.

722
00:42:45,562 --> 00:42:47,314
>> JEFF V.: Damn it.
>> JEFF: Is it a time of

723
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,274
celebration...
>> Yeah!

724
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,401
>> JEFF: ...or do tribal
loyalties run deep?

725
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,486
>> JEFF V.: I saw Colby walk
over to Keith, and they're,

726
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:53,779
like, pointing at us and
counting fingers, like, "She's

727
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,656
going to go first" and "He's
going to go second."

728
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:59,618
We weren't together 15 minutes
and it started.

729
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,500
>> MICHAEL: You don't... you
don't want to leave.

730
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:10,879
The longer you're here, the
longer you want to stay here.

731
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:14,675
And it's not even about winning
as much as... playing.

732
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:20,014
The winning will be
anticlimactic.

733
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:23,642
The playing is where it is for
me.
