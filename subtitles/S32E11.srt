2
00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:04,244
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,562
Tai, Jason and Scot 
thought they had full powers.

4
00:00:08,687 --> 00:00:10,310
From now on, we are unstoppable.

5
00:00:10,435 --> 00:00:12,153
Julia was their mole.

6
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:13,845
Want to know their plan?

7
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,422
They had an advantage...

8
00:00:15,547 --> 00:00:17,420
"You have won 
an extra vote."

9
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:20,729
...and two immunity idols 
that could be paired

10
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,384
to form a super-idol.

11
00:00:22,509 --> 00:00:24,139
If something happens, play it.

12
00:00:24,264 --> 00:00:26,138
What's great about the super-idol 
,

13
00:00:26,263 --> 00:00:28,670
it can be played 
after the votes have been read.

14
00:00:29,087 --> 00:00:31,149
But Aubry wanted to turn the game around

15
00:00:31,274 --> 00:00:33,539
and schemed 
behind Michele and Julia's back

16
00:00:33,664 --> 00:00:36,511
for Tai to turn 
against Jason and Scot...

17
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:38,138
Cydney, Joe and I:

18
00:00:38,263 --> 00:00:39,796
you have three people with you.

19
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:42,475
Tai has all the cards in hand.

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,586
...leaving Tai 
with a big decision.

21
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,190
I do not know what to do.

22
00:00:49,248 --> 00:00:50,458
At the council,

23
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,218
Scott received the majority of votes.

24
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,721
Ninth person eliminated 
and fourth member of the jury:

25
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:59,293
He then turned to Tai for 
the other half of the super-idol.

26
00:01:00,355 --> 00:01:02,588
But Tai betrays Scot and Jason...

27
00:01:02,713 --> 00:01:03,830
You don't?

28
00:01:05,123 --> 00:01:06,124
Wow.

29
00:01:06,249 --> 00:01:07,809
...sending Scot to the jury

30
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,769
with Jason's idol...

31
00:01:10,397 --> 00:01:12,456
Scotus, the tribe has spoken.

32
00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:16,851
...leaving Michele and Julia 
out of the picture

33
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:18,745
and Jason alone.

34
00:01:19,586 --> 00:01:20,840
There are seven left.

35
00:01:20,965 --> 00:01:22,765
Who will be eliminated tonight?

36
00:01:42,123 --> 00:01:43,564
It's a game, friends.

37
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:45,200
We eliminated Scot by surprise.

38
00:01:45,325 --> 00:01:47,307
It's a big hit. 
The smallest

39
00:01:47,432 --> 00:01:50,151
knocked out the biggest of the season.

40
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,716
It was excellent, 
really excellent.

41
00:01:52,841 --> 00:01:54,079
It was good.

42
00:01:54,204 --> 00:01:56,771
- So happy for you. 
- I'm happy for us!

43
00:01:56,896 --> 00:01:59,248
I'm so happy for you.

44
00:01:59,373 --> 00:02:00,723
And me for you!

45
00:02:01,544 --> 00:02:02,931
Scott and Jason

46
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,820
weren't listening to me.

47
00:02:05,945 --> 00:02:09,552
Tonight, I took control 
of my own game.

48
00:02:09,677 --> 00:02:11,096
We got the power now

49
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:13,041
and it's me who has the most,

50
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,468
because I have the idol 
and the extra vote.

51
00:02:16,694 --> 00:02:18,656
You won't be able 
to eliminate it now.

52
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:21,897
You won't be able to 
eliminate Tai now.

53
00:02:22,164 --> 00:02:23,977
But hey, well done. 
Well done, Cyd.

54
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,103
Yeah...

55
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,416
Great shot. As a fan, 
I tell you, a great shot.

56
00:02:29,754 --> 00:02:32,193
But as an 
opponent of the alliance...

57
00:02:32,592 --> 00:02:33,593
Grrrr!

58
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,937
Tai betrayed. 
I didn't see it coming.

59
00:02:37,062 --> 00:02:41,770
The only thing 
that could go wrong went wrong.

60
00:02:45,468 --> 00:02:46,918
Tai played the shot,

61
00:02:47,162 --> 00:02:49,678
Scotus had my idol, and alas,

62
00:02:49,928 --> 00:02:53,177
he was eliminated 
and therefore could no longer return it to me.

63
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,142
So I don't have any more.

64
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,016
I lost an ally and an idol.

65
00:02:59,141 --> 00:03:00,722
All this in a single instant.

66
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,083
Now 
I will have to hold on.

67
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,393
I'm all alone now, 
you know that.

68
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,643
If you want to try something crazy,

69
00:03:08,202 --> 00:03:10,165
you know I'm crazy about it.

70
00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:14,127
I won't forget, I promise.

71
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:17,430
Julia, you look 
completely shocked.

72
00:03:17,555 --> 00:03:19,417
Yes I am.

73
00:03:19,857 --> 00:03:23,404
Like Michele, I'm upset that I was 
n't warned.

74
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:26,009
I voted Nick with you, 
I voted Debbie with you,

75
00:03:26,134 --> 00:03:28,274
and tonight 
I voted for who I said.

76
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:30,004
You voted against me.

77
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:32,419
It happened, and I'm upset,

78
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:34,244
But it is okay. No matter.

79
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:36,883
I was playing on both counts.

80
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:40,666
But Aubry, Joe, Tai and Cydney

81
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:44,473
have formed an unbeknownst alliance

82
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:46,159
and eliminated Scot.

83
00:03:46,284 --> 00:03:48,528
You want to know why 
I voted against Scot?

84
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,918
Honestly, 
I don't really care.

85
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,718
Now Michele and I 
have lost a few notches

86
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:56,593
after this vote.

87
00:03:58,926 --> 00:04:01,416
We are at the bottom of the scale.

88
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,891
It's like that...

89
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,422
- It's like that. 
- We're done.

90
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,555
Friends, we made it!

91
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,024
Final square assured.

92
00:04:11,149 --> 00:04:13,161
- Jason no longer has an idol? 
- Nope.

93
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,287
OK.

94
00:04:14,412 --> 00:04:16,827
No idol. I don't think 
there is another one.

95
00:04:16,952 --> 00:04:18,718
I can't stop smiling anymore.

96
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:20,427
We eliminated Scot

97
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,913
and it feels crazy!

98
00:04:24,522 --> 00:04:27,542
It completely changed 
the dynamic of the game.

99
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,903
From now on, 
no more surprises.

100
00:04:30,028 --> 00:04:32,215
We know what we have to do 
and we don't change.

101
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,900
We have the majority, 
we have to release Jason.

102
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:38,585
We have the majority 
and Jason no longer has an idol.

103
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,023
Let's hope Jason loses, 
we take him down,

104
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:44,426
and let's continue on 
our merry way.

105
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:27,665
I force myself to keep reminding myself

106
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,574
that Survivor is just a game,

107
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,564
that I made a big blow,

108
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:34,609
but this is the very first time 
i've done this to someone,

109
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,607
lie so much.

110
00:05:36,732 --> 00:05:38,299
It's a big betrayal.

111
00:05:38,424 --> 00:05:40,157
I want to talk to Jason,

112
00:05:40,282 --> 00:05:43,585
because he trusted me 
and I betrayed him.

113
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,462
It's painful.

114
00:05:45,587 --> 00:05:46,746
I feel guilty.

115
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:48,990
Listen to me.

116
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,116
I'm here.

117
00:05:51,243 --> 00:05:53,727
It's the hardest thing 
I've ever done.

118
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:55,455
Betray someone.

119
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,110
You and Scot 
grew closer and closer

120
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:00,992
and that worried me.

121
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:02,996
You could have let me down.

122
00:06:03,121 --> 00:06:05,540
I don't know, 
maybe you wouldn't have done it,

123
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,155
but I had to act first.

124
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,637
I understand what you did 
and why you did it.

125
00:06:10,762 --> 00:06:13,114
I did it out of respect for the game.

126
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:16,689
In this game, you can do everything well 
and still lose.

127
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,280
Hey, Mark!

128
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:22,182
I was afraid that on returning

129
00:06:22,307 --> 00:06:24,693
you wring his neck in anger.

130
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,645
I wouldn't have done that 
to the little chicken.

131
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,331
Mark and I are still allies. 
Hey, boy?

132
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:31,411
thank you for listening to me

133
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:33,768
and understand why

134
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,955
I screwed up your game.

135
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,528
It's not funny, but...

136
00:06:37,653 --> 00:06:39,744
- It's a game. 
- It's just ironic.

137
00:06:39,869 --> 00:06:41,677
Tai apologized well this morning,

138
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:44,466
half-baked excuses,

139
00:06:44,591 --> 00:06:48,390
but I can't let see 
how much it pissed me off.

140
00:06:48,927 --> 00:06:51,321
- Where are they all? Gone ? 
- I do not know.

141
00:06:51,446 --> 00:06:53,304
I just want my revenge.

142
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:57,179
It enraged me 
to remain without an idol or an ally

143
00:06:57,304 --> 00:06:59,252
and that Tai 
still has all his assets.

144
00:06:59,683 --> 00:07:01,947
For someone 
with such a big heart,

145
00:07:02,072 --> 00:07:03,823
he turns his jacket around,

146
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:05,825
scam full of people.

147
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,494
He fucked me up, me,

148
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:10,196
and he will meet the same fate 
because of it.

149
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:11,621
And he deserves it.

150
00:07:12,803 --> 00:07:14,994
Where do I sneak?

151
00:07:26,705 --> 00:07:27,981
Over here, everyone!

152
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:42,037
Ready for 
today's reward event?

153
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,095
Today,

154
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,334
you will run 
through a series of obstacles

155
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:48,343
while collecting rings.

156
00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:51,413
When you have the three rings,

157
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:54,282
you will throw them 
on a moving hook.

158
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,242
The first ones will win the reward.

159
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:57,957
Want to know what's at stake?

160
00:07:58,082 --> 00:07:59,779
A helicopter will pick you up.

161
00:07:59,904 --> 00:08:01,014
Oh my God !

162
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:04,720
You will have an aerial view 
of the island you live on

163
00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:06,626
for 28 days.

164
00:08:06,908 --> 00:08:09,578
You will land on a sandy island 
in the middle of the ocean

165
00:08:09,703 --> 00:08:11,399
where you will have a good picnic.

166
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:12,592
You chicken free,

167
00:08:13,871 --> 00:08:15,337
corn cobs,

168
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:16,763
Apple pie,

169
00:08:17,404 --> 00:08:19,507
sodas, wine.

170
00:08:19,757 --> 00:08:21,710
- Did you say "wine"? 
- Yes, wine.

171
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,410
He said "wine"!

172
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,757
- Is it worth it ? 
- Absolutely !

173
00:08:25,882 --> 00:08:28,508
Another thing: 
you will not run alone,

174
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:31,444
you will be tied in pairs.

175
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,150
We will draw lots

176
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:37,270
and therefore, a person 
will not participate.

177
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,186
We draw lots and we start.

178
00:08:43,684 --> 00:08:46,063
Our draw 
resulted in three pairs.

179
00:08:46,188 --> 00:08:48,003
Joe and Tai,

180
00:08:48,253 --> 00:08:49,905
Julia and Aubry,

181
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,102
Jason lost in the draw,

182
00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:55,973
he will not participate.

183
00:08:56,098 --> 00:08:58,158
Here we go, for the reward.

184
00:08:58,283 --> 00:08:59,406
Survivors, ready?

185
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,861
Go over 
this first obstacle.

186
00:09:06,986 --> 00:09:08,548
Julia and Aubry pass it quickly.

187
00:09:09,974 --> 00:09:11,293
Tai and Joe.

188
00:09:11,543 --> 00:09:13,728
It is necessary to detach this first ring.

189
00:09:14,229 --> 00:09:17,799
You need three rings 
to complete this trial.

190
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,836
Michele and Cydney quickly finish 
this first part.

191
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,306
Tai and Joe have their first ring.

192
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:26,287
Julia and Aubry, just behind.

193
00:09:26,412 --> 00:09:28,910
And already, they are falling heavily.

194
00:09:29,526 --> 00:09:32,280
Cydney and Michele, 
over then under!

195
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,121
Above.

196
00:09:34,246 --> 00:09:36,337
Go over the first 
and under the next.

197
00:09:36,462 --> 00:09:37,477
Below.

198
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:38,895
Above.

199
00:09:39,437 --> 00:09:41,399
Michele and Cydney still in the lead,

200
00:09:41,524 --> 00:09:43,049
undoing the second ring.

201
00:09:43,174 --> 00:09:44,880
Julia and Aubry just behind.

202
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,954
Tai and Joe try to catch up with them.

203
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,522
Prepare to climb.

204
00:09:50,225 --> 00:09:53,146
Michele and Cydney 
go for the third ring.

205
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:54,827
For my part !

206
00:09:54,952 --> 00:09:56,296
Aubry and Julia arrive.

207
00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:58,098
You have to climb that ladder.

208
00:09:58,483 --> 00:10:00,683
Hop, I pass and I arrive at the top.

209
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:03,511
Tai and Joe have their second ring.

210
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,076
Michele tries to take it off.

211
00:10:10,955 --> 00:10:12,583
Aubry also tries.

212
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,200
Tai's turn!

213
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:16,216
Everyone 
is more or less equal.

214
00:10:18,038 --> 00:10:19,828
Aubry and Julia have theirs!

215
00:10:20,257 --> 00:10:21,763
They take the lead!

216
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:22,889
Try you!

217
00:10:23,014 --> 00:10:25,101
Cydney will try, 
can she make it?

218
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:26,711
It's Cydney versus Tai!

219
00:10:28,076 --> 00:10:29,299
Tai a le temple!

220
00:10:29,424 --> 00:10:30,661
Cydney at her temple!

221
00:10:30,786 --> 00:10:32,432
Everyone has the three rings!

222
00:10:33,741 --> 00:10:35,343
Now we have to hang them.

223
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,536
Give them to me.

224
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:38,304
Tai and Joe are right behind.

225
00:10:39,497 --> 00:10:40,774
It's difficult.

226
00:10:41,609 --> 00:10:43,552
Everybody 
throw the rings now.

227
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,786
Cydney sends one.

228
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,159
Cydney grabs one!

229
00:10:48,284 --> 00:10:50,173
Cydney and Michele 
have their first ring.

230
00:10:50,298 --> 00:10:51,302
We go back !

231
00:10:51,427 --> 00:10:52,827
A big reward!

232
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:56,197
A chance to get away from the game

233
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,124
or even change the game.

234
00:10:59,772 --> 00:11:01,127
Let me try a little.

235
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,473
Joe grabs one!

236
00:11:05,852 --> 00:11:06,998
Tied, 1 - 1.

237
00:11:07,123 --> 00:11:09,073
Michele and Cydney have one.

238
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:10,894
Cydney grabs a second one!

239
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:12,906
Attractive !

240
00:11:13,031 --> 00:11:15,710
Joe grabs a second one! 
Tie, 2 - 2!

241
00:11:15,835 --> 00:11:17,904
Julia and Aubry 
are still trying to get into it.

242
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:19,379
Why can't we get there?

243
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:22,390
More than a ring 
for Cydney and Michele,

244
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,616
Joe and Tai!

245
00:11:24,332 --> 00:11:25,860
Here we are !

246
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:27,854
For victory !

247
00:11:28,352 --> 00:11:29,431
Just missed!

248
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:30,924
Cydney, for the win!

249
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:36,338
Cydney rolls and wins!

250
00:11:36,588 --> 00:11:38,840
Cydney and Michele 
win the reward!

251
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,042
I want that chicken, Jeff!

252
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:46,373
Michele and Cydney, come here.

253
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:49,276
Just there.

254
00:11:50,485 --> 00:11:51,486
Congratulation.

255
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:52,988
Your first victory.

256
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:55,724
- She wanted fried chicken, so... 
- For a while!

257
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,325
This is how it goes:

258
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,136
the helicopter will land, 
take you for a ride,

259
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,123
and drop you in the middle of the ocean 
where you will have your picnic.

260
00:12:03,248 --> 00:12:06,902
Well, like the last 28 days,

261
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:09,004
there were 
only surprise eliminations,

262
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:12,574
that means alliances 
are constantly changing.

263
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:15,777
So this decision 
should be interesting.

264
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:19,381
You can choose a person 
to accompany you.

265
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:22,484
Anyone, even Jason, 
who didn't participate.

266
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:25,078
You must agree 
on the person chosen.

267
00:12:27,976 --> 00:12:29,090
It was quick!

268
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,427
Michele, does it surprise you, 
this consensus, so fast?

269
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:35,187
No. Someone has not eaten, 
and that person must.

270
00:12:35,312 --> 00:12:36,865
Alright, who do you choose?

271
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,768
Aubry, come!

272
00:12:48,326 --> 00:12:50,516
Enjoy your afternoon, 
the helicopter is coming.

273
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,280
Here it is.

274
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:03,970
I'm glad we decided to have 
Aubry split the reward,

275
00:13:04,095 --> 00:13:07,162
because last night, 
I did not vote with the majority,

276
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,357
and at some point, I have to say to myself: 
"Okay, this is my game."

277
00:13:10,482 --> 00:13:14,300
It's a great chance 
to make sure I'm with them,

278
00:13:14,425 --> 00:13:17,239
that they trust me, 
that they want to move forward with me.

279
00:13:20,947 --> 00:13:23,870
We needed this! 
Day 28, girls!

280
00:13:26,564 --> 00:13:29,158
Good. Joe, Tai, Julia, Jason, 
I have nothing for you.

281
00:13:29,283 --> 00:13:31,251
Pack your things, head back to camp.

282
00:13:31,376 --> 00:13:34,723
The horizon is dark there, really.

283
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,405
But I'm not giving up yet.

284
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,480
I can't. 
For my family, I can't.

285
00:13:39,748 --> 00:13:41,302
I have to keep trying.

286
00:13:41,427 --> 00:13:42,749
I'll do my best.

287
00:13:42,874 --> 00:13:46,195
I'm going to try to manipulate these people, 
to find a flaw somewhere.

288
00:13:57,052 --> 00:13:59,080
Oh my God !

289
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,307
It's incredible !

290
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:06,388
We are free !

291
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,572
That feeling of flying! 
It was the foot.

292
00:14:09,697 --> 00:14:12,193
It's too good.

293
00:14:12,443 --> 00:14:14,534
It is an unforgettable experience.

294
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:15,889
Look, united!

295
00:14:16,014 --> 00:14:18,868
- Beauty, Intelligence and Muscles! 
- Perfect !

296
00:14:20,302 --> 00:14:23,196
I'm in a helicopter, 
down to a beautiful beach,

297
00:14:24,755 --> 00:14:27,409
She is only for us.

298
00:14:28,557 --> 00:14:31,207
Survivor 
is about unique experiences.

299
00:14:31,764 --> 00:14:35,283
It's a great pick-me-up 
to get back on your feet

300
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:37,786
and readjust 
for the next 11 days.

301
00:14:41,103 --> 00:14:42,415
It's chicken time!

302
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,098
White or rosé?

303
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,310
That's good.

304
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:47,387
- The coleslaw is super good. 
- The coleslaw?

305
00:14:52,771 --> 00:14:55,028
- Treat yourself, my dear. 
- It's the best day.

306
00:14:55,153 --> 00:14:56,703
The best day.

307
00:14:57,454 --> 00:15:00,368
I get by in life 
thanks to my social skills.

308
00:15:00,493 --> 00:15:02,027
I build links

309
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,270
and that's what got me this 
far in the game.

310
00:15:04,395 --> 00:15:07,175
Julia and I are close, 
and even though I trust her

311
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,808
and enjoy working with her,

312
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:10,337
we are only two.

313
00:15:10,462 --> 00:15:11,806
To rejoin the group,

314
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:13,955
they will have 
to trust me.

315
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,853
So I want to be sure that even if 
I was out of the vote,

316
00:15:16,978 --> 00:15:19,127
I'm not 
out of the covenant.

317
00:15:19,648 --> 00:15:22,664
Well, it's obvious 
that Julia and I are close,

318
00:15:22,914 --> 00:15:25,033
but I've been super loyal.

319
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:28,362
I don't want 
you to doubt me.

320
00:15:28,832 --> 00:15:31,682
I think everyone 
wants to work with you.

321
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,900
That's what I want. 
I want it to work.

322
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:35,929
I told you, I trust you.

323
00:15:36,054 --> 00:15:38,171
- Me too. 
- It's true, I trust you.

324
00:15:38,296 --> 00:15:41,380
Michele proved her loyalty, 
every time she voted with us,

325
00:15:41,505 --> 00:15:43,643
except for the time 
we had to leave it in the dark.

326
00:15:43,768 --> 00:15:45,618
So I trust him.

327
00:15:46,385 --> 00:15:47,614
It's too good.

328
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,616
It's clear, 
it's the best test.

329
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:53,091
I feel reintegrated into the group.

330
00:15:53,216 --> 00:15:57,148
That says a lot about my ability 
to inspire confidence,

331
00:15:57,273 --> 00:15:59,153
staying happy,

332
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:01,942
while remaining humble and poised.

333
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:06,474
I hope my loyalty 
will make them keep me a little longer.

334
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,668
Well, what do you think?

335
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:11,883
I think we are fine.

336
00:16:12,008 --> 00:16:14,649
Michele is a good option.

337
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,077
This is also my opinion.

338
00:16:16,202 --> 00:16:19,157
I don't want to say we're on top, 
because I don't want to think that.

339
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:20,283
The same.

340
00:16:20,408 --> 00:16:22,824
But I think we're going like this, 
rather than like this.

341
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:23,950
Exactly.

342
00:16:24,075 --> 00:16:25,230
But at the same time,

343
00:16:25,355 --> 00:16:28,096
we can't go to the final 
with that damn Tai.

344
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,980
It wouldn't be 
our best choice.

345
00:16:30,105 --> 00:16:32,021
If we go with Joe or Michele,

346
00:16:32,146 --> 00:16:33,946
we would have a better chance.

347
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:35,986
You have to think about it.

348
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,098
It's good to start thinking about it,

349
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:41,690
but right now, 
we have to get Jason and Julia out.

350
00:16:42,429 --> 00:16:45,818
For now, we have to keep 
our alliance with Tai super strong,

351
00:16:45,943 --> 00:16:48,475
because it can help us move forward.

352
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,718
As Tai has an immunity idol 
and an advantage,

353
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:55,026
it would be better to eliminate 
it as soon as possible.

354
00:16:55,151 --> 00:16:57,162
And we can use Michele 
to make it happen.

355
00:16:57,287 --> 00:16:59,782
This is what I need 
to go all the way.

356
00:16:59,907 --> 00:17:03,298
When to make that big shot, 
that's the question.

357
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,252
- We'll figure out what to do. 
- Yeah.

358
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,578
We have to win immunity.

359
00:17:20,836 --> 00:17:23,576
- We have to keep fighting. 
- Yes.

360
00:17:24,254 --> 00:17:26,955
They will surely vote against me.

361
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:29,619
We have to be able to get out of this, Julia.

362
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:32,063
You and me.

363
00:17:32,787 --> 00:17:35,297
I am at the bottom of the scale. 
It sucks.

364
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:37,480
I will not give up, 
you have to try.

365
00:17:37,605 --> 00:17:39,568
There is always room.

366
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:41,403
There is a way to stay.

367
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:44,064
You just have to figure out how 
before it's too late.

368
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,675
I can't believe 
I'm so close.

369
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,944
But I want to get even closer.

370
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,438
I just have to figure out how.

371
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:56,668
Getting rid of Tai 
would leave us free.

372
00:17:56,793 --> 00:17:57,794
Absolutely.

373
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,399
But if they keep it on purpose...

374
00:18:00,524 --> 00:18:02,490
- That's stupid. 
- Really stupid.

375
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,640
But we don't have the majority.

376
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,230
What would be the ideal scenario?

377
00:18:10,731 --> 00:18:12,596
There are four voices against him,

378
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:15,328
either he plays his idol 
and someone else is eliminated

379
00:18:15,615 --> 00:18:17,565
or he goes home with his idol.

380
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,834
You, me, Michele, we have to try.

381
00:18:21,272 --> 00:18:23,550
But I don't know 
who would be our fourth.

382
00:18:23,675 --> 00:18:25,113
A fourth is needed.

383
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:27,682
Tai is a huge threat 
in the game.

384
00:18:27,932 --> 00:18:30,643
He has an immunity idol,

385
00:18:30,768 --> 00:18:32,361
he has an advantage,

386
00:18:33,484 --> 00:18:36,953
and he will win if he goes to the final.

387
00:18:37,078 --> 00:18:40,095
Gotta find someone 
who realizes it's stupid

388
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,647
not to use Jason, Michele 
and me to eliminate him today.

389
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:45,467
As a good doggie, Joe will stay at the foot.

390
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:46,642
Yeah, I know.

391
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:50,096
Aubry told him not to move 
while he was gone.

392
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,999
We could probably 
convince Cydney.

393
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:55,135
Yeah, we need to talk to Cyd.

394
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,524
We can't do anything 
before she comes back.

395
00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:00,576
We have a plan for Tai.

396
00:19:00,701 --> 00:19:03,919
There is a real possibility 
with Julia and Michele,

397
00:19:04,044 --> 00:19:05,788
but we need a fourth.

398
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:07,947
The only possibility left 
is Cydney.

399
00:19:08,953 --> 00:19:11,892
Cydney likes surprise votes, 
that's obvious.

400
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:14,262
Maybe she wants 
to do another big hit.

401
00:19:15,045 --> 00:19:16,898
- Hi ! 
- Hello !

402
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:19,267
We got along well at first.

403
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:21,106
Maybe she'll switch sides.

404
00:19:21,231 --> 00:19:23,672
I have to sell, sell, 
sell my plan.

405
00:19:27,104 --> 00:19:29,269
Thinking about 
doing something crazy then, Cyd?

406
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:31,268
What's your plan?

407
00:19:31,393 --> 00:19:34,207
It all depends on 
whether you want to release Tai or not.

408
00:19:34,332 --> 00:19:36,576
If you would like to listen to us...

409
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,938
I am always open 
to proposals.

410
00:19:39,063 --> 00:19:40,879
When we're on the council,

411
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,083
we will write TAI.

412
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,654
With Michele, we vote Tai.

413
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:47,773
Everyone else 
will vote for one of us,

414
00:19:47,898 --> 00:19:50,056
since you are not going to 
eliminate each other.

415
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,958
Tai plays his idol,

416
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,482
remains, and one of us is eliminated,

417
00:19:54,607 --> 00:19:58,531
or Tai gets caught 
and all the idols are gone.

418
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,834
And you will still have the majority.

419
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,034
It holds up, that's for sure.

420
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:04,982
I put myself 
in a great position,

421
00:20:05,107 --> 00:20:06,449
my options are open.

422
00:20:06,574 --> 00:20:08,753
Now I have to see 
what's best for me.

423
00:20:08,878 --> 00:20:10,708
It's a solo game, 
not a team game.

424
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,113
If staying with my alliance 
is better for me,

425
00:20:13,238 --> 00:20:14,738
that's what I have to do.

426
00:20:14,863 --> 00:20:17,158
If I have to turn tail 
and vote Tai to advance,

427
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:18,502
I'll do that instead.

428
00:20:18,627 --> 00:20:20,482
It's a win/win, 
either way.

429
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,931
At least you know where our votes will go,

430
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,095
and uh...

431
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,725
Do your thing, girl.

432
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,202
That's to say ?

433
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:29,133
The real fans of this game

434
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:31,120
know it's designed 
to be vicious.

435
00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:34,512
You won't win 
if you're just loyal.

436
00:20:34,637 --> 00:20:37,916
You have to cheat, steal 
and knock things over

437
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,674
and this surprise vote against Tai 
could really change the game.

438
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,710
As soon as Tai leaves, 
we eat Mark.

439
00:20:45,182 --> 00:20:47,380
I'm not even kidding, 
I can't wait.

440
00:20:48,553 --> 00:20:50,203
What do you want ?

441
00:21:06,453 --> 00:21:08,043
Over here, everyone!

442
00:21:19,602 --> 00:21:22,023
Ready for the immunity test?

443
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,698
First, Jason, 
I have to take the necklace back.

444
00:21:25,823 --> 00:21:27,373
Sorry to hear that.

445
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:29,429
Win it again!

446
00:21:32,435 --> 00:21:34,745
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

447
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:37,909
Today you will run 
to a platform,

448
00:21:38,034 --> 00:21:40,709
where you will memorize symbols

449
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:42,878
and their corresponding numbers .

450
00:21:43,003 --> 00:21:45,402
Then you'll come back 
and use these numbers

451
00:21:45,527 --> 00:21:48,228
to find the combination 
that will release a key.

452
00:21:48,353 --> 00:21:49,676
If you just do,

453
00:21:49,801 --> 00:21:52,520
the key will open a box 
containing puzzle pieces.

454
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:55,789
The first person 
to find the mystery word

455
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,337
will win immunity

456
00:21:57,462 --> 00:22:01,947
and will ensure a one in six chance 
of winning this game.

457
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:05,590
The losers will go to the council, 
where after 29 days,

458
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:08,528
someone will become 
the fifth member of the jury.

459
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:10,772
You don't want it to be you.

460
00:22:10,897 --> 00:22:13,066
We draw the places at random 
and we start.

461
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,441
OK, let's go !

462
00:22:21,898 --> 00:22:23,777
For immunity, Survivors, ready?

463
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:34,956
Jason leads quickly,

464
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:37,891
raising the legs 
to reach the obstacle.

465
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,770
You have to get 
over this platform.

466
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,004
Finally, we will test your memory,

467
00:22:45,351 --> 00:22:47,876
and after 29 days 
in this environment,

468
00:22:48,557 --> 00:22:49,578
who knows

469
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:53,878
how many symbols and numbers 
you can memorize at once.

470
00:22:57,378 --> 00:23:00,989
Match 
numbers with symbols.

471
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:05,917
When you've had your fill, 
you can leave.

472
00:23:07,642 --> 00:23:12,033
There is no logical connection 
between the number and its symbol.

473
00:23:12,283 --> 00:23:14,102
You have to make the connection.

474
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,363
You have to find a way, 
in your head,

475
00:23:17,393 --> 00:23:20,808
to link each symbol 
and not forget.

476
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:23,670
You don't know which one you will need

477
00:23:23,795 --> 00:23:25,947
when you return to departure.

478
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,701
It is unlikely to 
memorize them all at once.

479
00:23:28,826 --> 00:23:31,826
You have to memorize 
what you can and start again.

480
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,242
Cydney has had enough and leaves.

481
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:38,852
Jason, following in his footsteps, leaves too.

482
00:23:38,977 --> 00:23:40,852
This is Michele and Julia,

483
00:23:40,977 --> 00:23:41,978
and Aubrey.

484
00:23:42,618 --> 00:23:45,092
Cydney drove off 
and everyone followed.

485
00:23:45,217 --> 00:23:46,826
There, it is the race to return.

486
00:23:46,951 --> 00:23:47,952
Here is Tai.

487
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,706
Even a tiny obstacle

488
00:23:52,256 --> 00:23:56,311
can be exhausting 
after 29 days of Survivor.

489
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:59,281
And as you move forward,

490
00:23:59,406 --> 00:24:02,117
you try 
to remember the symbols

491
00:24:02,242 --> 00:24:03,624
and numbers,

492
00:24:03,899 --> 00:24:05,887
over and over again, in your head.

493
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,045
Joe shifts into another gear.

494
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,432
71 years old. Not bad.

495
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:16,909
Cydney and Jason 
return first.

496
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:21,387
With Michele, 
here is Aubry accelerating again!

497
00:24:21,512 --> 00:24:23,163
Julia follows her closely!

498
00:24:23,923 --> 00:24:25,707
Now you have to remember

499
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:28,312
which number goes with which symbol.

500
00:24:28,437 --> 00:24:31,437
This will tell you how many squares to 
turn the wheel.

501
00:24:36,634 --> 00:24:40,471
Michele writes the numbers 
in the sand to remember them.

502
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,924
Tai does the same now.

503
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:48,210
There are 12 symbols, 
but you only need 5.

504
00:24:48,335 --> 00:24:51,235
The question is: 
have you memorized the good ones?

505
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:53,668
Do you have the right numbers

506
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:55,295
to find the combination?

507
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,772
Otherwise, you will have to leave.

508
00:25:00,492 --> 00:25:02,689
Aubry has a little, 
but she has to go again.

509
00:25:02,814 --> 00:25:05,780
Cydney leaves as Joe arrives.

510
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,316
Tai leaves, he doesn't have enough.

511
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:10,986
Julia and Michele try again

512
00:25:11,236 --> 00:25:14,136
after only seeing the numbers 
once.

513
00:25:14,261 --> 00:25:15,991
Jason pulls out a key.

514
00:25:16,116 --> 00:25:17,350
There are eight keys

515
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:19,575
and only one opens the box.

516
00:25:19,962 --> 00:25:21,562
Julia unties a key.

517
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,739
The question is: are you right?

518
00:25:23,864 --> 00:25:26,035
Did you memorize 
the correct numbers?

519
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,737
Jason thinks so and he will try.

520
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:33,041
It would be an impressive victory 
to get there without having to leave.

521
00:25:33,572 --> 00:25:35,052
It's up to Julia to try.

522
00:25:35,177 --> 00:25:36,211
If it's good,

523
00:25:36,336 --> 00:25:37,533
the padlock will open.

524
00:25:37,658 --> 00:25:38,705
If it's wrong,

525
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,807
you will have to go back 
to the platform,

526
00:25:40,932 --> 00:25:42,594
so it better be good!

527
00:25:43,022 --> 00:25:45,045
Jason made a mistake, he has to go back.

528
00:25:45,926 --> 00:25:47,152
It's good for Julia!

529
00:25:47,277 --> 00:25:48,652
She opened her box!

530
00:25:48,777 --> 00:25:50,517
Start searching for 
the mystery word!

531
00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:53,259
Michele will try.

532
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:56,668
- Joe, are you giving up? 
- Yes, I'm out of juice.

533
00:25:56,793 --> 00:25:58,692
Joe gives up.

534
00:26:00,447 --> 00:26:01,734
Michele found it!

535
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:03,865
It's between Julia and Michele,

536
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,072
both very advanced

537
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:10,478
while the others 
check numbers and symbols.

538
00:26:10,728 --> 00:26:12,872
An incredible performance!

539
00:26:12,997 --> 00:26:16,028
Julia and Michele 
found it very quickly!

540
00:26:18,066 --> 00:26:20,766
You must find the word.

541
00:26:20,891 --> 00:26:22,916
What is this mystery word?

542
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:25,318
Shit !

543
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,222
Jason and Aubry return.

544
00:26:31,141 --> 00:26:33,068
Julia tries to move on.

545
00:26:33,193 --> 00:26:35,143
Michele hurries forward.

546
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:37,772
You have to find the right order.

547
00:26:37,897 --> 00:26:40,235
What word do you need to find?

548
00:26:42,993 --> 00:26:46,043
Michele is moving fast now. 
She thinks she has it.

549
00:26:52,312 --> 00:26:54,484
If she is right, 
it will be a big win!

550
00:26:54,609 --> 00:26:55,891
-Jeff? 
- Say it!

551
00:26:56,016 --> 00:26:57,350
"Eliminated by surprise"!

552
00:26:57,475 --> 00:26:59,819
Michele wins 
individual immunity,

553
00:26:59,944 --> 00:27:02,622
she won't be 
eliminated by surprise tonight,

554
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:04,199
to the council!

555
00:27:14,323 --> 00:27:15,823
Michele, come closer!

556
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:20,681
- Congratulation ! 
- Thanks !

557
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,142
I have to ask you,

558
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:24,587
how many numbers 
did you memorize at once?

559
00:27:24,712 --> 00:27:25,778
All.

560
00:27:28,052 --> 00:27:30,191
You finished so quickly!

561
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:31,317
nice job,

562
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:34,580
you are guaranteed 
to have a one in six chance of winning.

563
00:27:34,705 --> 00:27:37,165
As for the rest of you, 
someone will be eliminated tonight

564
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:40,001
and will become 
the fifth member of the jury.

565
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:41,973
It won't be you. 
Congratulation.

566
00:27:42,098 --> 00:27:44,957
Take your things, return to camp. 
See you tonight at the council.

567
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:48,561
I needed this victory 
and I got nothing.

568
00:27:48,686 --> 00:27:51,079
I could barely try.

569
00:27:51,204 --> 00:27:54,285
We need to be sure 
that Cydney and Michele are okay

570
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,752
to eliminate Tai,

571
00:27:57,015 --> 00:27:58,016
or

572
00:27:58,141 --> 00:27:59,546
I'm exhausted.

573
00:28:13,633 --> 00:28:15,154
Well done, Michele.

574
00:28:17,282 --> 00:28:18,540
It was impressive.

575
00:28:18,665 --> 00:28:21,135
I can't believe you 
memorized all those numbers.

576
00:28:21,957 --> 00:28:24,880
My family is going crazy!

577
00:28:25,483 --> 00:28:28,483
Since the reward, 
we are four plus Michele.

578
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:31,686
Jason and Julia are on the sidelines.

579
00:28:32,258 --> 00:28:34,258
Jason is a ticking time bomb,

580
00:28:34,383 --> 00:28:36,883
so tonight's vote 
looks super easy,

581
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:39,586
but I'm not sure 
that's the best option.

582
00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:46,234
So, what do we do, my beauties?

583
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:48,163
Me, I'm leaning towards Jason,

584
00:28:48,288 --> 00:28:50,972
because if there is another test 
in the water, he will beat us all.

585
00:28:51,097 --> 00:28:53,121
Julia finished 
right behind you today?

586
00:28:53,246 --> 00:28:54,567
Yes, she is very strong.

587
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:56,626
She is good at puzzles.

588
00:28:56,751 --> 00:28:59,147
She is very fast, 
she has a great memory.

589
00:28:59,272 --> 00:29:02,375
If it's balance, 
she'll deliver.

590
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,560
I said "Jason"

591
00:29:04,685 --> 00:29:07,357
before you knew 
she was so close to you,

592
00:29:07,482 --> 00:29:08,682
I didn't know.

593
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:12,008
Jason is a physical threat ,

594
00:29:12,133 --> 00:29:15,475
but he's also 
a very polarizing character.

595
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,288
In the jury 
there will be people who like it

596
00:29:18,413 --> 00:29:20,093
and people who hate him.

597
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:23,342
So I don't think 
he can win.

598
00:29:23,997 --> 00:29:25,478
The thing with Julia,

599
00:29:25,603 --> 00:29:29,290
is that his physical game 
is complete

600
00:29:29,415 --> 00:29:32,180
and that in addition, 
she has no blood on her hands.

601
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:35,208
She proved 
she could be quite strategic

602
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:38,276
to dodge and scheme

603
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,013
to get to stay in the game.

604
00:29:40,384 --> 00:29:41,881
Julia must leave.

605
00:29:43,076 --> 00:29:45,752
So, have you decided? 
What is the instruction?

606
00:29:45,877 --> 00:29:48,144
- I believe so, dear. 
- It will be Julia.

607
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:49,723
The group agrees?

608
00:29:53,845 --> 00:29:56,506
Basically, I was okay 
with voting Jason

609
00:29:56,631 --> 00:29:59,089
and there, we decide to take Julia out.

610
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,608
It seriously sucks.

611
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:03,555
In a perfect world, 
I would love to continue with Julia:

612
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,830
I trust him completely,

613
00:30:06,129 --> 00:30:09,851
she proved her loyalty to me 
many times

614
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:11,912
and we've been together 
since day one.

615
00:30:12,037 --> 00:30:15,123
So I don't want to write the name 
of my closest ally.

616
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,647
We all know 
she's coming to ask me.

617
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:19,572
So I tell him it's Jason?

618
00:30:19,697 --> 00:30:22,589
If they ask you and me, 
we say we're doing the thing against Tai.

619
00:30:24,367 --> 00:30:27,193
I don't wanna hear my name, 
it's never good in Survivor.

620
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:32,510
I don't trust them 
and I don't feel Michele and Cydney.

621
00:30:32,635 --> 00:30:34,770
- Wooden cross, iron cross. 
- If I lie...

622
00:30:34,895 --> 00:30:36,311
It's Survivor

623
00:30:36,436 --> 00:30:39,251
and I want to 
dot the T's

624
00:30:39,376 --> 00:30:42,117
and the bars on the I's, 
I don't know how to say it anymore.

625
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:45,820
Tonight, I will take 
my idol and my advantage.

626
00:30:45,945 --> 00:30:47,345
I won't leave

627
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,649
with an idol in his pocket.

628
00:30:54,995 --> 00:30:56,898
So what's the plan?

629
00:30:57,023 --> 00:31:00,226
We're back to the wall 
with this Tai idol thing.

630
00:31:00,351 --> 00:31:02,729
If Tai goes to the final, he wins.

631
00:31:02,854 --> 00:31:05,765
So you, me, 
Jason and Cydney are voting Tai.

632
00:31:07,468 --> 00:31:11,092
Earlier I told the others 
that I would vote Julia

633
00:31:11,217 --> 00:31:12,939
so that everyone is happy,

634
00:31:13,064 --> 00:31:16,409
to assure them 
that I am fully with them.

635
00:31:16,534 --> 00:31:19,618
But if Jason and Julia 
really have Cydney's vote,

636
00:31:19,743 --> 00:31:21,448
the vote against Tai might work

637
00:31:21,573 --> 00:31:24,284
and it would also save Julia, 
that would be great.

638
00:31:24,409 --> 00:31:25,859
because it kills me

639
00:31:26,297 --> 00:31:28,597
to imagine having to vote against it.

640
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:31,107
Getting rid of Tai is crucial.

641
00:31:31,232 --> 00:31:32,558
Yes, I will vote Tai.

642
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:34,994
Good me too.

643
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:36,796
Hope Cydney is with us.

644
00:31:50,472 --> 00:31:53,044
What's new ? 
Are we good?

645
00:31:53,169 --> 00:31:55,582
So we're doing the plan against Tai 
you were talking about?

646
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,650
It's logic.

647
00:31:58,314 --> 00:32:00,061
At least one idol is leaving tonight.

648
00:32:00,186 --> 00:32:01,187
Exactly.

649
00:32:01,312 --> 00:32:04,047
I hope we have the majority 
to get rid of Tai,

650
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,292
but that doesn't mean 
it's safe.

651
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,225
If Tai plays his idol,

652
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,338
he will stay and one of us will leave.

653
00:32:11,811 --> 00:32:13,400
Julia and I make two.

654
00:32:13,525 --> 00:32:16,032
If you and Michele are with us, 
it doesn't matter what they do.

655
00:32:17,633 --> 00:32:19,038
It should be interesting.

656
00:32:19,163 --> 00:32:20,515
We agree ?

657
00:32:23,377 --> 00:32:25,311
Tonight, Michele and I 
have two options.

658
00:32:25,684 --> 00:32:28,882
We can either go 
with Julia and Jason

659
00:32:29,007 --> 00:32:30,592
and eliminate Tai by surprise,

660
00:32:30,717 --> 00:32:33,467
or follow the original plan 
of our alliance

661
00:32:33,592 --> 00:32:35,564
and eliminate Julia by surprise.

662
00:32:38,109 --> 00:32:39,225
What do you think ?

663
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,486
It's good for us to have the choice.

664
00:32:41,796 --> 00:32:42,925
For sure.

665
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:46,484
But everything we do 
must have a purpose.

666
00:32:46,609 --> 00:32:47,834
Absolutely.

667
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:52,539
So are they voting Tai 
or are they trying to get me?

668
00:32:52,948 --> 00:32:55,092
Michele says she will vote Tai.

669
00:32:55,217 --> 00:32:56,218
Sydney too.

670
00:32:56,343 --> 00:32:59,170
If it works, Tai will leave 
with his idol in his pocket.

671
00:32:59,295 --> 00:33:00,845
And we will still be here.

672
00:33:01,404 --> 00:33:03,683
And then we will go to the final.

673
00:33:04,028 --> 00:33:05,161
If I leave,

674
00:33:05,286 --> 00:33:07,706
maybe at least 
he'll lose all his goddamn idols.

675
00:33:08,662 --> 00:33:12,011
Like he made 
my fucking idol disappear.

676
00:33:16,523 --> 00:33:19,585
I have a lot at stake 
on the board tonight.

677
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,769
I have to make a decision 
about my relationship with Julia

678
00:33:22,894 --> 00:33:24,234
and with my alliance.

679
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:26,559
I don't want to betray either of them.

680
00:33:28,451 --> 00:33:31,978
I'm having a hard time choosing what to do.

681
00:33:32,103 --> 00:33:35,257
It can really affect your game 
mentally and emotionally.

682
00:33:35,507 --> 00:33:38,581
All I can do 
is try to play my game.

683
00:33:54,934 --> 00:33:56,836
Now here are the members of the jury.

684
00:34:05,203 --> 00:34:07,989
and Scot, eliminated at the last council.

685
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:16,431
Julia, where are we in the game 
now?

686
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:20,235
I believe we are 
at a crucial moment.

687
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,416
Every decision we make, 
every person we eliminate,

688
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:26,661
every conversation we have 
can make or break your game.

689
00:34:26,786 --> 00:34:30,011
The only person who can feel 
100% safe tonight,

690
00:34:30,136 --> 00:34:31,246
it's Michelle.

691
00:34:32,497 --> 00:34:35,450
you think the same, 
that everything you do

692
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:39,030
from now will have an impact 
on the gain of the million?

693
00:34:39,155 --> 00:34:40,156
It's certain.

694
00:34:40,281 --> 00:34:43,083
Every thing we do, 
every word we say,

695
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:44,651
everyone remembers it.

696
00:34:44,776 --> 00:34:47,596
Sometimes people want to listen, 
other times they don't.

697
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,868
But you have to weigh 
all the options,

698
00:34:50,993 --> 00:34:53,034
because anyone among these five

699
00:34:53,284 --> 00:34:54,634
is the fifth.

700
00:34:55,464 --> 00:34:57,630
Julia, who do you think is at the bottom of the scale 
?

701
00:34:57,755 --> 00:35:01,434
I think of the five, 
Michele and Cydney are downstairs.

702
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:04,970
Aubry holds Joe's hand 
to take him to the final.

703
00:35:05,095 --> 00:35:07,273
Tai is a great competitor

704
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:09,309
and he has the potential 
to win the game.

705
00:35:09,629 --> 00:35:12,754
We must be wary of that 
and try to change it.

706
00:35:14,272 --> 00:35:16,067
Tai, it must be a little stressful

707
00:35:16,192 --> 00:35:18,526
to hear Julia call out your name.

708
00:35:18,651 --> 00:35:21,030
Yes, because I have the idol

709
00:35:21,155 --> 00:35:24,332
and I also have the secret advantage.

710
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:25,960
I am fully aware of that.

711
00:35:26,085 --> 00:35:27,694
It's scary.

712
00:35:27,819 --> 00:35:30,038
I want to remind my allies,

713
00:35:33,644 --> 00:35:35,343
why sink the boat?

714
00:35:35,468 --> 00:35:37,940
Why jump on a sinking boat and row with them,

715
00:35:38,065 --> 00:35:40,365
when do you have a guaranteed place?

716
00:35:40,692 --> 00:35:42,655
Aubry, we also 
mentioned your name.

717
00:35:43,144 --> 00:35:45,053
Is it also scary for you

718
00:35:45,178 --> 00:35:47,055
that it seems to be for Tai?

719
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,811
It's true that it's a little scary,

720
00:35:48,936 --> 00:35:53,213
but you have to base yourself on the relationships 
you have built with people

721
00:35:53,338 --> 00:35:55,023
and trust that.

722
00:35:55,148 --> 00:35:57,691
At the same time, 
I trusted my allies,

723
00:35:57,816 --> 00:35:59,092
and what happened?

724
00:35:59,217 --> 00:36:00,769
Scott? Goodbye !

725
00:36:01,646 --> 00:36:04,039
Tai flipped 
over more times than a pancake.

726
00:36:04,164 --> 00:36:06,587
He's done it twice already!

727
00:36:06,712 --> 00:36:08,843
To his strong allies!

728
00:36:08,968 --> 00:36:11,580
What makes you think 
there won't be a 3rd time around?

729
00:36:12,401 --> 00:36:15,951
The bond between Scot and you 
was so strong,

730
00:36:16,076 --> 00:36:17,725
you two were in control.

731
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:20,113
It made me feel uncomfortable, 
I had to break that.

732
00:36:20,523 --> 00:36:24,559
So you left my wedding ring, 
because Scot and I were close.

733
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:26,619
And you left for an alliance

734
00:36:26,744 --> 00:36:27,963
where Aubry and Joe

735
00:36:28,088 --> 00:36:29,564
are even more so!

736
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:34,736
Jason argues that Tai cannot 
be trusted.

737
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:37,230
That's what makes 
alliances so complicated.

738
00:36:37,355 --> 00:36:39,841
Are you 
constantly assessing the situation?

739
00:36:39,966 --> 00:36:41,360
"Are the five united?"

740
00:36:41,485 --> 00:36:43,778
"Should I do a hit?" 
"Is this the right move?"

741
00:36:44,028 --> 00:36:46,997
Yes, I'm constantly thinking

742
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,943
and you have to anticipate, in this game.

743
00:36:50,331 --> 00:36:52,821
You have to make a move 
at one time or another

744
00:36:52,946 --> 00:36:54,647
if we want his game to be respected.

745
00:36:54,772 --> 00:36:58,593
When you are present at the end, 
you have to have something to say.

746
00:36:59,546 --> 00:37:01,855
Cydney, Michele brings up 
an interesting point:

747
00:37:02,135 --> 00:37:04,966
it's difficult 
to eliminate a person,

748
00:37:05,216 --> 00:37:08,003
to crush his dream 
of making a million,

749
00:37:08,128 --> 00:37:10,397
then turn around and say, 
"Give it to me!"

750
00:37:10,878 --> 00:37:13,566
You want the jury 
to respect your game.

751
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:16,505
They'll give the million 
to someone who played the game

752
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:19,806
rather than someone 
who only betrayed people

753
00:37:19,931 --> 00:37:22,224
and only advanced like that.

754
00:37:22,742 --> 00:37:26,221
Jason, you have a common interest, 
it overlaps.

755
00:37:26,346 --> 00:37:29,291
You want to stay, 
the five want to make a hit

756
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:31,087
to plead their case in the end.

757
00:37:31,212 --> 00:37:33,128
There may be a marriage of interest

758
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:34,863
where one helps the other.

759
00:37:34,988 --> 00:37:36,544
Couldn't have said it better, Jeff.

760
00:37:36,669 --> 00:37:38,324
Every person in this clique

761
00:37:38,449 --> 00:37:41,995
must be able to justify themselves 
to those on the benches.

762
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,141
"Why me? 
What did I do?

763
00:37:44,266 --> 00:37:45,638
How did I dominate,

764
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,942
how did I foil,

765
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:48,835
how did I last longer?"

766
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,237
We're two castaways 
looking for a home.

767
00:37:51,707 --> 00:37:55,725
The ideal people to ask to 
do something crazy.

768
00:37:56,009 --> 00:37:59,921
Everyone knows from the tips 
that I love doing crazy stuff.

769
00:38:00,764 --> 00:38:01,765
So Michele,

770
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:04,284
if the right situation arises,

771
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:07,395
are you the type to say, 
"Yeah, I'm willing to have a shot." ?

772
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:10,432
You have to follow your instincts 
in the game

773
00:38:10,682 --> 00:38:13,897
and you have to feel sure 
of your decisions.

774
00:38:14,226 --> 00:38:17,218
If you're not comfortable, 
maybe that's telling.

775
00:38:17,343 --> 00:38:20,242
Intuition counts a lot 
in this game,

776
00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:22,711
and I try to follow mine.

777
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:26,748
Cydney, are you open 
to big shots?

778
00:38:27,161 --> 00:38:28,250
Downright.

779
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:31,144
If an idea arises, 
you have to think about it and listen to it.

780
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:33,013
Every decision at this stage

781
00:38:33,138 --> 00:38:35,123
will make or break your game.

782
00:38:35,248 --> 00:38:37,366
You have to determine 
what you want to see happen.

783
00:38:37,701 --> 00:38:39,851
Tai, you were very careful.

784
00:38:39,976 --> 00:38:42,155
How are you feeling 
right now,

785
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,899
just before the vote?

786
00:38:44,605 --> 00:38:46,220
Not comfortable at all.

787
00:38:46,345 --> 00:38:47,418
I'm going...

788
00:38:50,342 --> 00:38:52,240
I'm not comfortable at all.

789
00:38:54,473 --> 00:38:55,911
Wow, once again

790
00:38:56,036 --> 00:38:59,381
we come to the votes 
with many doubts.

791
00:38:59,902 --> 00:39:01,301
It's time to vote.

792
00:39:01,426 --> 00:39:02,626
Jason, over to you.

793
00:39:21,994 --> 00:39:24,172
Sorry, I'm not crossing it 
this time.

794
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:44,150
I will count the votes.

795
00:39:51,674 --> 00:39:53,721
Should I play my idol?

796
00:39:56,969 --> 00:40:00,567
I don't think so, 
but it's up to you.

797
00:40:04,545 --> 00:40:07,315
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

798
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,275
now is the time to do it.

799
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:21,287
Good. Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

800
00:40:21,412 --> 00:40:24,232
The eliminated person 
will leave the board immediately.

801
00:40:24,357 --> 00:40:25,767
I will read the votes.

802
00:40:29,362 --> 00:40:30,452
First vote:

803
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:31,791
That is.

804
00:40:37,404 --> 00:40:38,938
Tai. 
That's two Tai votes.

805
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,518
Julia. 
That's two Tai votes,

806
00:40:43,643 --> 00:40:44,920
two votes Julia.

807
00:40:46,828 --> 00:40:48,548
Julia. 
That's three votes Julia,

808
00:40:48,673 --> 00:40:49,923
two Tai votes.

809
00:40:54,546 --> 00:40:57,365
Tenth person eliminated 
and sixth member of the jury...

810
00:40:57,615 --> 00:40:59,414
Julia, that's four, 
that's enough.

811
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:00,894
Bring me your torch.

812
00:41:02,862 --> 00:41:03,863
Good luck.

813
00:41:16,086 --> 00:41:17,786
Julia, the tribe has spoken.

814
00:41:20,398 --> 00:41:22,048
It's time to go.

815
00:41:30,101 --> 00:41:32,815
For the first time perhaps,

816
00:41:33,126 --> 00:41:36,125
no one came confident 
to the council.

817
00:41:36,688 --> 00:41:39,174
Fear came into play

818
00:41:39,424 --> 00:41:41,409
and when fear controls you,

819
00:41:41,534 --> 00:41:42,953
everything can happen.

820
00:41:43,078 --> 00:41:45,804
Take your torches, 
return to camp. Good night.

Next time in Survivor...

826
00:42:06,793 --> 00:42:08,047
Jason is down.

827
00:42:08,172 --> 00:42:10,163
Nobody wants 
to play games with me.

828
00:42:10,288 --> 00:42:11,457
It annoys me too much!

829
00:42:11,778 --> 00:42:14,267
Until the majority 
cracks from within.

830
00:42:14,392 --> 00:42:16,803
I think it's Michele. 
It's a bigger threat.

831
00:42:16,928 --> 00:42:18,914
Are you trying to lead the dance? 
I say no.

832
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:21,905
If it comes to that, 
will you vote with me or with them?

833
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,785
It's super hard.

834
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:26,441
I'm disgusted, 
but proud of how I played.

835
00:42:26,566 --> 00:42:28,853
Being one of the youngest 
to ever participate,

836
00:42:28,978 --> 00:42:32,127
I had the opportunity to grow up here.

837
00:42:32,252 --> 00:42:33,916
I learned a lot about myself.

838
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:35,791
I played big shots

839
00:42:35,916 --> 00:42:38,123
and contributed 
to some awesome surprise kills.

840
00:42:38,248 --> 00:42:40,137
I didn't go out 
without trying,

841
00:42:40,262 --> 00:42:42,305
I did not go out 
after being passive.

842
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:43,930
At least I played.
