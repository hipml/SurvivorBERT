00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:03,128
<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:05,463
Tom brought in the big one.

4
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:06,589
( laughing )

5
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:07,632
>> How did you get it?

6
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:08,258
>> I hit it with the machete.

7
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,009
>> Oh, now, who's

8
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:10,593
the great white shark killer?

9
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,011
>> And wham!

10
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:12,595
>> It's gonna be a lot harder

11
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,888
to vote him off now.

12
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:14,597
>> Yeah!

13
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:15,640
( Tom whoops )

14
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:16,725
>> PROBST: When tree mail

15
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,852
arrived, the tribes learned

16
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:20,228
they were to build an SOS signal

17
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,771
that could be seen from the air.

18
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:22,313
>> Little rain...

19
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:23,189
>> I say we burn

20
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:23,648
our friggin' shelter.

21
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,192
>> PROBST: Ulong jumped right

22
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,610
in, while Koror took a more

23
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,361
methodical approach.

24
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,654
>> The first thing that we want

25
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:30,989
to do is find the right

26
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:31,656
location.

27
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,074
>> PROBST: When the plane flew

28
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,784
over Ulong, the drop master

29
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,452
was not impressed.

30
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,995
>> Unless you're flying

31
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:37,829
right over the top,

32
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:38,329
it would be hard to see.

33
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,707
>> PROBST: And although Koror

34
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,750
had trouble with their fire...

35
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,834
Do you have enough information

36
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:43,710
to make a decision?

37
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:44,711
>> Yes, I do.

38
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:45,754
>> PROBST: ...it was their

39
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,130
signal that best caught the eye

40
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,590
of the drop master.

41
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:50,216
( cheering )

42
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,511
>> I'm so happy!

43
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:54,304
>> In the box was three

44
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,556
bottles of red wine...

45
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:57,599
>> Cheese tortellini

46
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:58,308
and tomato sauce.

47
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,185
>> And then we had all of these

48
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,187
military food packages

49
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,438
that you could heat up

50
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,439
and eat as meals.

51
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,191
>> To a great tribe.

52
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,275
>> PROBST: At Ulong, the tribe

53
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,693
took the loss hard.

54
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,111
>> We lost the reward challenge

55
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:10,653
because they worked harder.

56
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,405
Or I'm sure they worked

57
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,490
smarter, knowing them.

58
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,240
>> PROBST: At Koror, Jenn and

59
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,701
Gregg's budding romance

60
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:17,911
raised some red flags.

61
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:18,870
>> I'm concerned

62
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:19,704
with Gregg and Jenn.

63
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,206
It just could be a monkey wrench

64
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,457
that we don't see coming.

65
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,501
>> PROBST: At the immunity

66
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,127
challenge, Ulong couldn't get it

67
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,462
together.

68
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,505
Ulong may be worse off

69
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,380
than when you started.

70
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,632
>> Back.

71
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:31,800
>> PROBST: And Coby moved his

72
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:32,717
tribe to another Koror victory.

73
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:33,384
>> Left-- empty spot,

74
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,011
and I swear we got it.

75
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:35,762
>> PROBST: And with that,

76
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:36,763
Koror wins immunity

77
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,139
for the sixth straight time.

78
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,891
Before Tribal Council,

79
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,851
Stephenie feared the worst

80
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,102
when Bobby Jon couldn't commit.

81
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:43,686
>> I thought we were sticking

82
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,270
together, no matter what.

83
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,313
>> Well, it's just kind

84
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,357
of a toss up, you know?

85
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:47,816
>> You're not sticking

86
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:48,274
with your word, then?

87
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,317
>> I don't really want

88
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,360
to talk about it.

89
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,862
>> I can tell by the way he's

90
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,197
acting he's gonna vote for me.

91
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,448
>> PROBST: But the votes came

92
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,866
in, and Ibrehem was voted out,

93
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,827
when Bobby Jon honored his

94
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,369
arrangement with Stephenie

95
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,245
to be the last

96
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:04,374
two members of Ulong.

97
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,376
Ten are left.

98
00:02:06,459 --> 00:03:36,466
Who will be voted out tonight?

99
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:41,054
( blowing )

100
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,972
>> There it goes.

101
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:43,306
>> I thank you

102
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,349
for keeping your word.

103
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:45,350
>> Yeah?

104
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,392
>> I was a little nervous.

105
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,477
I-I knew it was

106
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,854
a hard decision for you.

107
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,273
>> It's over. It's done.

108
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,358
There wasn't no good way

109
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,442
to do it, you know?

110
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,610
>> I know.

111
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:56,819
Tonight we went to Tribal

112
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:57,946
Council, and I was

113
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,739
really nervous.

114
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:00,657
I really thought

115
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,366
I was gonna be the one to go.

116
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,283
Bobby Jon, he beat

117
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,035
around the bush.

118
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:04,994
He didn't really want

119
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:05,495
to give me an answer on

120
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,413
whether he was going to vote

121
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:07,830
for me or Ibrehem,

122
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,540
but luckily he kept his word

123
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:15,380
and Ibrehem went home.

124
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,341
>> Ibrehem and I, we had a

125
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,385
friendship, we had a bond, but

126
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,469
in competition you have

127
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,513
to rule out feelings, and

128
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:23,846
I just thought

129
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,347
Stephenie has performed

130
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,099
better than Ibrehem

131
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,142
at challenges, so... I did what

132
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:28,643
was best for the tribe.

133
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,395
>> I'm glad that we're still

134
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,312
here.

135
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:31,688
I'm still ready

136
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,523
to bring home a victory.

137
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,857
I think we can do it.

138
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,192
>> Yeah, I do, too.

139
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:37,527
>> It was tough with three,

140
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,529
and it's already weird being

141
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,780
here only with two, but

142
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:41,489
I don't feel

143
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,199
that my time is up here.

144
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:44,409
I'm still ready to win,

145
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,160
and it's clear now

146
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:46,577
that Bobby Jon and I

147
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,246
are the two people

148
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,707
best for the job right now.

149
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,602
( buzzing )

150
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,032
>> Eww! Go!

151
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,366
Get out of here!

152
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,076
>> What's with the rats today?

153
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,411
There's like six of them playing

154
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,579
in front of the steps.

155
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,496
>> They're looking for...

156
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,456
>> Yeah.

157
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,000
>> Just took them a few days

158
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:34,417
to lose their fear.

159
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,501
The rats, they're

160
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,712
going crazy today.

161
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,380
I don't know if, uh, if we've

162
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,381
gotten sloppy with food

163
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,799
or we're cutting the coconuts

164
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,384
too close to the camp or...

165
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,510
I just think it's that the rats

166
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,055
have got comfortable with us

167
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:47,597
and realize that we're not

168
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,269
a threat to them.

169
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:53,770
>> The rats have become

170
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,605
bolder and bolder, and it's all

171
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,939
our tribe's fault because nobody

172
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:57,857
will listen to me.

173
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,691
There's coconut everywhere,

174
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,109
so of course the rats are going

175
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,319
to become more and more bold.

176
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,320
They're eating our coconut,

177
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:02,862
which is all over the camp

178
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:03,613
because people won't clean up.

179
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,115
So every bit of rat that we get

180
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,201
all over us is deserved.

181
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,536
>> You are?

182
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,621
>> Uh, I'm not smelling

183
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,206
it anymore.

184
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,290
I've told people for days.

185
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:14,791
I have told Tom every day

186
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,625
since he caught that shark

187
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,668
to move his damn shark head,

188
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:18,669
because it stinks,

189
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,545
there's flies everywhere.

190
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,630
It's not even 20 feet

191
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,464
from our camp.

192
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,673
So I got up this morning,

193
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,591
I moved the shark head,

194
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:24,675
I moved the guts because nobody

195
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,676
was doing anything, as usual.

196
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,761
I'm the one who has to get the

197
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:27,929
firewood, I'm the one who has to

198
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,180
keep the fire going, I'm the one

199
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,181
whoa has to boil the water.

200
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,140
I'm the one who has

201
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,058
to go hunt food.

202
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:32,934
Those girls don't do anything,

203
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:33,851
especially Jennifer,

204
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,019
Katie and Janu.

205
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:35,603
Katie and Jennifer don't do

206
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,562
anything all day long.

207
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,648
I've never seen them touch a

208
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,066
piece of wood since we've been

209
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,818
here, and now Janu is on her

210
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,944
eighth straight day of,

211
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,362
"Boo-hoo! I want to go home."

212
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,238
Would you quit already?

213
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,239
Get out of the game.

214
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,448
You know, I'm too much of a

215
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,032
feminist to watch this happen.

216
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,450
These Alpha males are just

217
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:49,992
totally waiting on them hand

218
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,494
and foot, and the girls

219
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,411
are loving it.

220
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,412
They're eating it up.

221
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,455
It's making me sick.

222
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:54,789
I want to take

223
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,457
all three of those girls

224
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,792
and push them in that fire.

225
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:01,462
( sighs ): Oh...

226
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:09,470
>> Come on in, Koror.

227
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,265
We'll now bring in Ulong.

228
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,724
Ibrehem voted out

229
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,935
at the last Tribal Council.

230
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:16,477
>> Hi.

231
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,437
>> PROBST: You're only two,

232
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:18,980
but you're still a tribe.

233
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:19,689
>> Yep.

234
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,316
>> PROBST: Okay, let's get

235
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,985
to today's challenge.

236
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,403
It is going to require

237
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,572
an adventurous spirit,

238
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,656
a willingness to try

239
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:29,532
something new

240
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,616
and an overall open

241
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,534
attitude toward life.

242
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,744
It is a food challenge.

243
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,246
The food you're going

244
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,831
to be eating is a delicacy.

245
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:37,707
It's also very nutritious.

246
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,251
It's from this part of the

247
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,669
world, and it's called balute.

248
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,087
Balute is a fertilized egg

249
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,672
that contains

250
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,841
partially-formed duckling.

251
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:47,133
These ducks

252
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,968
are about 20 days old.

253
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,261
>> Oh, my gosh.

254
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:50,803
>> PROBST: You can see the

255
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,889
beak... and it is full of

256
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:53,973
protein.

257
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,349
Here's how it'll work.

258
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,934
We're gonna go in rounds.

259
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,019
Each round, we will

260
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,228
increase the number

261
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,146
of balute you eat.

262
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,105
In the first round

263
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,356
you'll eat one balute,

264
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,107
then two balute,

265
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,109
then three balute

266
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,068
and finally four balute.

267
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,236
There will be four rounds.

268
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,696
Each time you get it down, you

269
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:09,947
score a point for your tribe.

270
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,157
At the end of four rounds,

271
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,116
whoever has the most

272
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,992
points wins reward.

273
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:13,784
Makes sense?

274
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:14,702
>> Mm-hmm.

275
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,745
>> PROBST: Want to know what

276
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:16,204
you're playing for?

277
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,288
>> Yeah.

278
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,289
>> Yeah.

279
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,457
>> PROBST: I know you both have

280
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,291
showers.

281
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,500
What you don't have for

282
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,585
those showers is fresh water.

283
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,045
First part of your reward,

284
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,088
55 gallons of fresh water

285
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,632
in a tank with a showerhead

286
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:28,966
delivered to your camp.

287
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,009
That's water

288
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,219
you don't have to find,

289
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,011
water you don't have

290
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:32,553
to bring back,

291
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,888
water you don't have to boil.

292
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,014
To go along with that,

293
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,140
because, trust me,

294
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,308
you guys reek...

295
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:37,683
( laughing )

296
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,684
...a little

297
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,644
luxury gift bag here.

298
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,270
>> Wow.

299
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:41,771
( cheering )

300
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,981
Everything you need to get

301
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,733
clean, get that taste

302
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:46,984
out of your mouth,

303
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:47,652
get that smell off your body.

304
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,403
Do not underestimate

305
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,739
how revitalizing that can be

306
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:52,698
to get clean again.

307
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,158
That's what you're playing for.

308
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:54,700
Koror, because you have

309
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,370
six extra members now,

310
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,621
you're sitting six people out.

311
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,747
Just tell me the two

312
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,873
that are going to compete.

313
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,709
Ian... and Tom.

314
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:04,835
It'll be Ian and Tom

315
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,587
versus Steph and Bobby Jon.

316
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,255
Everybody else,

317
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:11,217
take a spot on the bench.

318
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,802
Round one, come on up.

319
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,179
This is not a race.

320
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,847
This is just get it down.

321
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:17,723
Here's how you know

322
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,182
when you're finished.

323
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,684
Show me an empty mouth.

324
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:20,977
I'll say you're good.

325
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,644
Once I say you're good, if it

326
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,812
comes back up, it's fine.

327
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,523
Balute is served.

328
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:26,607
>> Oh.

329
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,692
>> PROBST: Survivors ready?

330
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,818
>> Ready.

331
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,903
>> Ready.

332
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,365
>> PROBST: Eat.

333
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,157
>> How's it, Tom?

334
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,284
>> PROBST: Bites right in.

335
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,702
>> Come on, Tom, it's beer.

336
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:42,290
>> PROBST: So does Steph.

337
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,291
>> Down.

338
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:43,916
>> PROBST: Tom's clean.

339
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,542
He's good.

340
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,042
>> Give me a wink, Tom.

341
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:45,835
Come on, show me something.

342
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,503
All right.

343
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:49,380
>> PROBST: That's good.

344
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,923
Koror and Ulong both score.

345
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:51,674
We're tied one-one

346
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,633
after the first round.

347
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,385
>> Watch the beak.

348
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,177
>> Okay.

349
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,346
>> PROBST: Next two, come on up.

350
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,763
>> "Watch the beak."

351
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,807
>> PROBST: Survivors ready?

352
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:04,603
Eat.

353
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,856
>> Mmm!

354
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,899
That was a juicy one.

355
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,151
>> Echh.

356
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,445
( Ian chuckles )

357
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:12,862
>> Oh... Umm...

358
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:13,821
What's going through

359
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,615
your head, Ian?

360
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,198
>> There was some egg shell

361
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,616
in that one.

362
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,617
>> PROBST: Sure that was what

363
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,493
was the crunchy part?

364
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,286
>> I don't know.

365
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,245
>> I don't either.

366
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,496
>> But I need the soap.

367
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,080
>> PROBST: Bobby Jon, we got a

368
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,874
little piece right there on the

369
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,208
plate.

370
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:26,667
Let me see that thing.

371
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,171
That'll work.

372
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,381
All right. That'll work.

373
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,049
>> All right, Ian.

374
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:33,674
>> Good job, Ian.

375
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,800
>> PROBST: We're good after two

376
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:35,801
rounds.

377
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:36,135
Tom and Steph,

378
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,137
we are tied at two-two.

379
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,430
You now have three balute

380
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,473
to get down.

381
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:47,813
Survivors ready... and eat.

382
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,231
>> PROBST: Thinking at all about

383
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,441
what you're eating, Steph?

384
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,400
>> Eggs.

385
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,109
>> PROBST: Eggs.

386
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:52,943
It's just eggs.

387
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,153
>> Just don't look at it.

388
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:54,737
>> I got a chirp out of that

389
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,447
one.

390
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,908
>> Mmm. Mmm.

391
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,117
>> PROBST: Tom has three down.

392
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,202
He's clearing that mouth.

393
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:01,744
That's good.

394
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,912
>> Damn, Tom.

395
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,790
>> Hungry.

396
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,208
>> I can feel the feet

397
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,169
a little, too-- they scratch.

398
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,003
>> PROBST: That looks good.

399
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,588
Tom and Steph--

400
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:13,798
they've downed three balute.

401
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:14,882
We are tied three-three,

402
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,926
moving into the last round.

403
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,677
Ian, Bobby Jon,

404
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,471
four balute waiting for you.

405
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:21,680
Survivors ready...

406
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,016
eat.

407
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,392
>> Come on, Ian.

408
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:24,892
>> Good job, I.

409
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,811
>> PROBST: Bobby Jon not messing

410
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:27,061
around.

411
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:27,728
He's almost done.

412
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,355
>> Come on, I.

413
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,981
>> Come on, I. Just keep...

414
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,274
>> It's all right, I.

415
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,442
Get it down.

416
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,568
>> PROBST: Open that mouth,

417
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,694
brother.

418
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,823
That's good.

419
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,784
Ian gets down all four

420
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,159
just like that.

421
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:42,952
Head back.

422
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,287
We are tied four-four.

423
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,205
>> PROBST: Okay, moving into

424
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,706
a tiebreaker.

425
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,666
You'll pick

426
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:49,583
your strongest person.

427
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:50,668
You'll eat five balute.

428
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,002
It's a time trial.

429
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,379
First one to get five down

430
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,463
wins reward.

431
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,381
>> I was hoping

432
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:55,881
for a few more of these.

>> PROBST: Who's it going to be

434
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:58,801
for Koror?

435
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,844
>> It's going to be Tom.

436
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:00,970
>> PROBST: Tom's going to take

437
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:01,804
the five.

438
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:02,054
>> Got it.

439
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:02,847
>> PROBST: And Bobby Jon.

440
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,849
Come on up.

441
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:05,975
>> Come on, Tom.

442
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,309
>> Attaboy, Tom. Come on.

443
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,227
>> PROBST: At stake:

444
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,979
55 gallons of fresh water.

445

That is a lot of water.

446
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:11,897
Plus everything you need

447
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,650
to get clean-- get this taste

448
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:15,776
out of your mouth.

449
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,403
First one to get all five down,

450
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:17,903
show me an empty mouth,

eat.

454
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,329
Bobby Jon two-fisting it.

455
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,372
>> Good job. Good job.

456
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,331
>> PROBST: Tom trying,

457
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,833
taking nibbles from both.

>> Come on, now.

459
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,127
>> PROBST: Gonna come down

460
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,211
to an empty mouth.

461
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,045
>> Guiness, Guiness.

>> PROBST: Bobby Jon shoving

463

>> PROBST: Keep it in there.

466
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,887
Keep it over the plate.

467
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,054
>> You can do it, Tom.

468
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,014
Mind over matter, fireman.

469
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,056
>> You got it, Tom.

470
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,849
>> Nice job. Nice job.

471
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:47,183
Nice job, Tom.

472
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,601
>> Come on, Tom.

473
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:49,435
You got it, Tom.

474
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,186
Come on, now.

475

but he's got to get it down.

( clapping )

484
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:03,032
>> Think about how dirty I am

485
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,034
now, come on.

486
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,827
>> You can do it, Tom.

487
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:07,912
Show him that mouth.

488
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,038
>> Come on, Tom.

489
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,998
>> Just swallow, Tom.

490
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:11,999
Hurry, before him.

491
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,167
>> Bobby Jon's getting it.

492
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,210
>> Hurry!

493
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,711
>> Swallow. Swallow.

494
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,379
Swallow it, Bobby Jon.

495
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,547

496
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,632

( Bobby Jon retching )

498

Tom's got it for Koror!

500
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:29,517
( cheering )

501
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,776
Might as well finish it.

502
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:39,902
Right, Bobby Jon?

503
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:40,986
>> Good job.

504
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,071
>> PROBST: Tom?

505
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,074
Rinse that out of your mouth.

506
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,534
A little Scope will make

507
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,910
that taste go away, huh?

508
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:48,994
>> Hook a brother

509
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,039
up, will you?

510
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:52,957
>> This tastes good enough

511
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,291
to drink.

512
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,376

Grab your stuff,

00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:01,006
head on back to camp, guys.

516
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,009
>> Man, I almost had him.

517
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:04,885
>> PROBST: Koror, 55 gallons of

518
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,929

showerhead, will be delivered to

520
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,724
your camp.

521
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:11,892
You can take this back with you.

522
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,270
Congratulations.

523
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,646
>> That's the soap.

524
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:16,939
I'm getting the dirt off!

>> Whoo!

528
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,218
>> The challenge today

529
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,096
was for a reward.

530
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,598
We got 55 gallons of water,

531
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,223
which is great,

532
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,100
and we won a basket of shampoo

533
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,061
and conditioner and toothpaste

534
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,104
and toothbrushes.

535
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,188
>> Cheers.

536
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,565
>> I'd say I'm a big fan

537
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:00,524
of the Scope mouthwash.

538
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,358
I particularly like

539
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,109
the Citrus Splash.

540
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,319
Tastes a little bit like

541
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,153
oranges.

542
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,195
( chuckling )

543
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,322
>> We all took a swig,

544
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,198
and just... it felt so good

545
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,992
'cause it was just tingling.

546
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:10,367
It was wonderful.

547
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,202
>> Did y'all want to come see

548
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,287
what you won back here?

549
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,204
New water thing.

550
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,414
>> Seeing the big drum up

551
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,373
there...

552
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,167
Oh! We have a shower.

553
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,960
I was looking forward

554
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,503
to feeling human for one day.

555
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,713
You think you should

556
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:23,797
use all that for showers?

557
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:24,882
Given that we're all still

558
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:25,549
drinking poisoned water.

559
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,925
>> We should use none of it

560
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:27,760
for showers.

561
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:28,802
>> I agree.

562
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:29,845
>>> I think we should

563
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:30,679
take off that showerhead

564
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,263
and fill canteens right out of

565
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,056
that spigot.

566
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,098
>> I think most people want

567
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,850
a shower, though.

568
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:35,768
Don't you?

569
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:36,226
>> Let's see how much

570
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,770
is over there.

571
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:38,854
>> Can we just have

572
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:39,688
one shower, and then...

573
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,314
>> We can, but we're still in

574
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,982
a survival situation here.

575
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,734
Jenn was crestfallen that she

576
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:44,234
wasn't going to get in.

577
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,904
I had to assert myself,

578
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:47,655
and it's something

579
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,989
I've been trying not to do.

580
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:49,990
But there were people

581
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:50,991
within the tribe who

582
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,451
actually thought that the first

583
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,994
fresh water that we've seen

584
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,120
in 19 days should actually

585
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,414
be used for shower purposes.

586
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,583
It's ridiculous.

587
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,210
>> What do you think, Jenn?

588
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,252
>> Jenn wants a shower.

589
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,462
>> Everybody takes a shower,

590
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,546
we're down to two-thirds.

591
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,756
I agree.

592
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,633
>> Tom is the one who spoke up.

593
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:08,926
"Well, I think we need

594
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,010
to, uh, conserve, you know,

595
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:10,386
and use that water

596
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,012
for drinking."

597
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,889
And it's 55 gallons of water!

598
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:15,432
I mean, come on.

599
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,517
You can't let us use,

600
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,685
like, a gallon or two?

601
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,227
>> I vote for not using the

602
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,104
fresh water, but like, I know

603
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,230
there's some people who

604
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,189
really want a shower

605
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,190
and really want

606
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,358
that comfort, so...

607
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,693
>> No, it's all right.

608
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:26,985
>> Nobody wants to speak up,

609
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:27,403
and I'm not going

610
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,153
to be that person.

611
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,364
I could see that coming back

612
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,407
to haunt me.

613
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,157
"Oh, Jenn really wanted to use,

614
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,909
you know,

615
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:35,369
the clean water for her bath."

616
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,286
>> So we're okay?

617
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:36,662
Everybody's good

618
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,122
with the decision?

619
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:38,997
>> Everyone's good, or...?

620
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:39,581
>> Yeah. Yeah, makes sense.

621
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,083
>> He really is not letting it

622
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,335
be a vote.

623
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,128
Maybe, in the end, that'll

624
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,672
make him be voted off, you know,

625
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:47,214
for being such a sourpuss

626
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:50,259
about the whole thing.

627
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,064
>> You see how much of that

628
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,899
stuff I had left in my hand?

629
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,025
Okay?

630
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:07,776
>> Yeah, I know.

631
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,153
It's always like that.

632
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,196
It's, like, we're there, but we

633
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,574
miss it by, like, an inch.

634
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,658
>> Today's defeat

635
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,075
is heartbreaking.

636
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,118
I mean, I had my throat open

637
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,245
as much as I could,

638
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,664
shoving it in there, but Tom,

639
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:21,915
he shoved his in faster.

640
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,000
Well, I'm getting tired

641
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,376
of losing to him, you know?

642
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,377
>> Right.

643
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,628
For some reason, you keep

644
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,463
matching up against him.

645
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,255
Well, you're the strongest

646
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,381
on our tribe, and he's

647
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,215
the strongest on theirs.

648
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:30,507
That's why.

649
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,217
>> I feel like I can beat

650
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,260
anybody else on that tribe.

651
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:33,510
>> I know.

652
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,094
>> If you want to

653
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,929
know the truth.

654
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:36,930
>> I know you can.

655
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:37,890
That's why you're not

656
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:38,474
going up against anybody else.

657
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,141
You're going up against him.

658
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,809
>> It just seems like Tom

659
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:41,477
beats me every single time, and

660
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,645
that's something

661
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,189
that's getting real, real old,

662
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,316
so I'm real pissed right now.

663
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:52,488
I mean, I see fire.

664
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,573
>> Bobby Jon?

665
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,824
I think he's been

666
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,910
too positive about the losses.

667
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:58,911
He's, like, "It's okay.

668
00:17:58,994 --> 00:17:59,620
We lost again.

669
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,038
We'll get them next time."

670
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:01,789
But he's starting

671
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:06,043
to get frustrated.

672
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:06,376
I don't know.

673
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,294
I guess guys

674
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,129
need to throw things,

675
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:09,671
punch things, make noise--

676
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,465
whatever they can to feel manly

677
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,549
when they're pissed off.

678
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,634
But, half the time,

679
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,260
he scares me.

680
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,814
Bobby Jon is sick of losing,

681
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,023
and I think he's finally,

682
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:28,440
finally starting

683
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,776
to take it to heart.

684
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:31,860
So, I was actually happy

685
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,029
to see him mad like that.

686
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,589
>> Being undefeated is glorious,

687
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,340
but it's a lot of days

688
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,216
of monotony.

689
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,760
We've been with the same people

690
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,637
for many days now, but

691
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,180
things are going to change real

692
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:00,556
quick around here.

693
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,724
No more Happy Koror Day.

694
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,101
No more... ( cheering )

695
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,185
It's going to be...

696
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,562
( growls )...

697
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,479
eating each other.

698
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,989
>> If they turn, then they need

699
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,073
to be broken up.

700
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:18,657
Gregg and Jenn-- they're part

701
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,283
of the alliance.

702
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,284
But I'm still worried about

703
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,286
them switching over and trying

704
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,495
to pick Tom and I off.

705
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,204
They're two votes strong.

706
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,372
That makes it a threat.

707
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,707
I think they're definitely

708
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,708
using their relationship

709
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,917
for strategic advantage, so we

710
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,210
know, going into it, you know,

711
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,795
that we're going to need to take

712
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:32,880
one of them out eventually.

713
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:33,964
We're all family, but there's

714
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:34,548
a business side to it, too,

715
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,551
so we are on the verge

716
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,302
of utter ridiculousness,

717
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,554
for sure, and I can't wait.

718
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,722
>> Well, listen, we

719
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:42,723
got good news.

720
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:43,807
Stephenie's still there...

721
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:44,683
>> We really need...

722
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:45,517
we're gonna need...

723
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,435
>> We needed that.

724
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,853
We have to keep that quiet here.

725
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:48,896
You can't slip in front

726
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:49,479
of Gregg, you know, and Jenn,

727
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,355
'cause just... 'cause we

728
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,231
are all together.

729
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,442
You got to keep that quiet.

730
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,110
Katie and Ian and I hooked up

731
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:56,695
on day two, and said let's see

732
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,280
how far we can take this.

733
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,364
And Stephenie also

734
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,407
was part of that group.

735
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,159
Except for myself,

736
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,118
Ian and Katie,

737
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:04,661
nobody even knows that there is

738
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,664
a relationship that Stephenie

739
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:08,749
would be the wolf

740
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:09,374
in the sheep's clothing

741
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,126
that they wouldn't

742
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:12,002
even see coming.

743
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,086
>> Final four is me,

744
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,880
you, Stephenie and-and Katie.

745
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:18,842
>> Right.

746
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,315
( grunts )

747
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,192
>> You all right?

748
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:35,776
>> Yeah. I just make noises.

749
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,361
I feel like if I scream

750
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,278
at it that, uh...

751
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:38,820
>> My boyfriend does that,

752
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,739
and I want to friggin' kill him.

753
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:41,365
>> Really?

754
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,449
>> It's hard being here

755
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,617
with just Bobby Jon.

756
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,077
Sometimes I don't know what

757
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,578
to say to him, you know?

758
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,371
It's just the two of us left.

759
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,873
We don't have a lot in common.

760
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,208
It's just tough.

761
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,209
( Bobby Jon burps )

762
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,627
Bobby Jon is totally turning

763
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,670
into a caveman.

764
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,547
( blowing gourd )

765
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,298
I mean, I'm not going to lie.

766
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,592
Like, I am disgusting,

767
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,010
but I scrub so much

768
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:02,386
with that sand--

769
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,721
my armpits, and my whole body--

770
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,014
that I really don't think

771
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,140
I smell that bad.

772
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:07,808
But Bobby Jon?

773
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:08,517
He's just gross.

774
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,269
He is always dirty.

775
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:10,519
Always.

776
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,729
( crunching )

777
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,147
And then he eats everything

778
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:14,481
and anything.

779
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,525
Like, today, we caught a crab.

780
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,402
And he's eating the whole

781
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,861
thing, and I'm, like, you know,

782
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,029
you're supposed to eat the

783
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:21,655
white meat inside.

784
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:22,489
Not the shell.

785
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:23,907
Oh, man...

786
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:24,491
>> I know that's gross.

787
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,618
>> Snot rocket.

788
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,830
>> I'm sorry. I got to do it.

789
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:30,998
>> Occasionally, I will turn

790
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,082
around and see him

791
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,041
blowing a snot rocket

792
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,126
straight out directly in

793
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,253
the middle of where we sleep.

794
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,421
He does apologize, but, um...

795
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:42,634
it's nasty.

796
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,094
It's hard, 'cause I-I think

797
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,345
about Koror all the time,

798
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,055
and I know that they are just,

799
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,140
like, living the life

800
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:48,473
over there.

801
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,308
They're having

802
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:50,809
the time of their life,

803
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,145
and here me and Bobby Jon are,

804
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,604
you know, busting our butts

805
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:55,397
to try to keep the fire

806
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,566
in the cave going.

807
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,817
I thought this was going

808
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,401
to be a piece of cake.

809
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,611
I could do this.

810
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:01,987
It's totally me.

811
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,281
I'm totally cut out for this.

812
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,282
And I am.

813
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:05,824
And I still believe that.

814
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:10,912
But it's tough.

815
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,332
Damn!

816
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,459
>> Got to let it down.

817
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,210
>> Holy crap!

818
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,920
Oh, man, need help?

819
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:23,633
( grunts )

820
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,718
>> Just getting that outrigger

821
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,136
into the water

822
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,512
damn near killed us.

823
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,056
Good job.

824
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:29,473
>> One, two, three.

825
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:33,477
( grunting )

826
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,147
( loud grunting )

827
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,315
>> Rest.

828
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:39,691
>> If I make it through this,

829
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,276
I can make it through anything.

830
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,402
( grunting )

831
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:43,820
I mean, it's tough physically,

832
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,280
it's tough mentally,

833
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:49,826
it's tough emotionally.

834
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,078
It's hard, it's like

835
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,204
we're halfway through,

836
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:55,832
but we have so long to go.

837
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,375
( voice breaking ): And...

838
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,418
I'm trying to be so strong

839
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,211
and it's like,

840
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,504
you can only do so much work.

841
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,422
And it's hard, it's like,

842
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,882
you're out here with no one.

843
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:07,552
And it is really hard.

844
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:11,056
I won't give up hope,

845
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,599
but I feel like we're at,

846
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:17,896
like, a dead end.

847
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:27,864
>> We are really

848
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,116
kind of down right now

849
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,075
'cause we're really tired

850
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,076
and we're really hungry,

851
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,619
but we're just going to keep

852
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,662
trying and trying.

853
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:34,454
You know, we don't give up,

854
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:42,129
and I-I value that.

855
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,672
>> I got one. I got one!

856
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:47,300
>> Wow!

857
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,426
Good job!

858
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,010
>> A school of needlefish swam

859
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,470
up, and I just shot

860
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,763
right in the middle of them

861
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:52,806
and happened to get one.

862
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:53,515
So I kind of felt like,

863
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,474
you know,

864
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,978
like I'd accomplished something.

865
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,354
Golly, the meat!

866
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:00,897
( whistles )

867
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,315
>> That's going to be

868
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,235
a lot to eat tonight.

869
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:08,572
Oh, my God.

870
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,031
>> How good is it?

871
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,241
>> Oh, my God.

872
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,284
This is so good.

873
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,285
There's so much meat.

874
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,578
The fish that we had, it was

875
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,246
like the best thing I ever had

876
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,289
in my life.

877
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:17,873
You can feel the protein going

878
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:18,498
into your body.

879
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,417
>> This is the breakfast

880
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,251
of champions.

881
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,669
>> We are having a feast.

882
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:23,753
It's been 21 days

883
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:24,504
and we've barely had any fish,

884
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,923
so it was a really nice treat

885
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:27,883
to have that.

886
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,092
And that's all we needed

887
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,178
to really get our spirits up.

888
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,189
>> Puzzle.

889
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,315
>> "Sink or swim."

890
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,482
>> "Sink or swim.

891
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:44,858
Think and swim."

892
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,526
>> "Today they mean the same.

893
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,028
For the tribe who can't do

894
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,154
either, one more will

895
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:49,529
leave the game."

896
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,531
>> It's imperative we win today,

897
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:52,616
because it's for immunity,

898
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,285
and if we lose,

899
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,287
there will be no more Ulong.

900
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:57,871
It's pretty much do or die.

901
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:58,747
>> It really is.

902
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,624
>> We're pretty tough

903
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:01,833
competitors, so I think today

904
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:02,959
immunity is going to be

905
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:03,793
Ulong's, finally,

906
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:04,711
'cause I'm pretty good

907
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,796
at this stuff.

908
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,311
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

909
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,270
to today's challenge?

910
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,355
>> We are.

911
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,356
>> Mm-hmm.

912
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,440
>> PROBST: First things first.

913
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:27,901
Janu has it today.

914
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:28,693
Immunity once again

915
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:32,948
back up for grabs.

916
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,074
Ulong, that means

917
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,367
anyone can win.

918
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,451
Okay, for today's challenge,

919
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:38,453
you're going to swim out

920
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,080
to a series of pontoons.

921
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:40,830
Underneath the pontoons

922
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,165
there's a rope

923
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:42,666
that leads to four bags

924
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,542
of puzzle pieces

925
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:45,710
spaced out along the course.

926
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,921
First person will swim out,

927
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:48,755
pull yourself along the rope

928
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,299
to the first bag of puzzle

929
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,592
pieces and unclip the bag.

930
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,010
You'll then hop up on the

931
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,178
pontoon, cross the balance beam

932
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,930
come back to the start.

933
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,390
Then the next person will go

934
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,599
out to collect the second bag.

935
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:00,642
You will alternate

936
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,227
until you have all four bags.

937
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:02,811
Once you have all four bags

938
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,230
of puzzle pieces, open them up,

939
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,606
start putting together

940
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,732
a word scramble puzzle.

941
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,025
Once you have the puzzle

942
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,402
put together,

943
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:11,486
start circling the words

944
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:13,738
that are on your puzzle board.

945
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,657
Any time two words intersect,

946
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,741
take that intersecting letter

947
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,536
and write it on a letter cube.

948
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,662
When you've found all the words,

949
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:21,913
take the intersecting letters,

950
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,456
use them

951
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,209
to form a three-word phrase.

952
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:26,751
That phrase holds the key

953
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,004
to immunity.

954
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,088
Koror, you're only running

955
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,339
two members.

956
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:31,840
The only people who cannot

957
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:32,799
participate are the people

958
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,842
who participated yesterday,

959
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,677
that's Ian and Tom.

960
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,761
Who are the two today?

961
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:37,762
>> Me and Coby.

962
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:38,305
>> PROBST: Coby and Gregg.

963
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:38,847
All right, everybody else

964
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,765
take a spot on the bench.

965
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:44,060
Wait for my "go."

966
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,065
Here we go, for immunity.

967
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,776
Survivors ready... go!

968
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,152
Gregg and Steph

969
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:55,322
into the water first.

970
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,406
Pull yourself underwater looking

971
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:59,200
for a bag of puzzle pieces.

972
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,869
Steph gets to the pontoon first.

973
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,204
Gregg right behind.

974
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:15,300

Puzzle pieces are not light.

978
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,601
Working the balance beam.

979
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:27,896
Gregg with a bit of a lead.

980

981
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,483
>> All right, Gregg.

982
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,610
Looking good.

983
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:34,110

almost walked on water.

990
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:53,171

Bobby Jon's got his, he's up.

997
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,560
We're dead even.

998
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,770

closing that gap.

1029
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:26,222

>> This has got to be it.

1056
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:30,912
The one we had before.

1057
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:34,040

"Victory at sea."

1078
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,543
Koror is right.

1079
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:21,170

Koror, once again immunity

1083
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:30,263
is going back to camp.

1084
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,431
Gregg.

1085

>> Good job, guys.

1086
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,935
>> PROBST: Ulong, I wish I had

1087
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:36,978
better news.

1088
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,396
Tribal Council tonight,

1089
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,856
because there are only two

1090
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,316
of you, there will be no vote.

1091
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,400
There will be an individual

1092
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,401
immunity challenge.

1093
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,485
Loser goes home.

1094
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,070

1095
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,322
>> PROBST: Grab your stuff.

1096
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:50,033

>> Nice job!

1098
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:08,092
>> Yay!

1099
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,385
>> Clean sweep.

1100
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,970
>> Way to rock it out, guys.

1101
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,056
>> A lot of effort.

1102
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,474
>> We won another immunity,

1103
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:15,600
which means that we've won

1104
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:16,643
every single immunity.

1105
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:17,644
It's mind-boggling.

1106
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:18,603
I never fathomed coming into

1107
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,146
this game I would be on a team

1108
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,064
this strong.

1109
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,732
>> I loved that we started out,

1110
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:23,358
it was like,

1111
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,317
the three oldest people,

1112
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,318
the gay guy...

1113
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,319
>> The skinny, gangly guy...

1114
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,236
>> The tall, skinny guy,

1115
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,279
the dancer...

1116
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,322
>> The skinny showgirl.

1117
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:30,198
>> You know?

1118
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,157
>> We were absolutely

1119
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,075
the underdogs.

1120
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,618
We were silly and goofy

1121
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:36,162
and kind of quirky-looking,

1122
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,331
and I cannot believe we won

1123
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,917
immunity every single time.

1124
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,503
>> We all made the jury.

1125
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:44,837
Isn't that crazy?

1126
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:45,922
>> It's a good thing.

1127
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:46,923
>> Today meant a lot

1128
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:47,465
because my whole life I've

1129
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,467
wanted to be part of a team.

1130
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,468
Because, you know,

1131
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:51,552
when I was a kid,

1132
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,054
the jocks would make fun of me,

1133
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,430
I'd quit, I'd run off crying.

1134
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,682
That was one of the reasons

1135
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:56,391
I came here.

1136
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,058
>> Good job, Coby.

1137
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:57,433
>> You know what?

1138
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,976
Every time we've

1139
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,977
done a physical challenge,

1140
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:00,937
you've stepped up, man.

1141
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:01,938
Like, you've been very physical.

1142
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:02,855
>> Don't make me cry.

1143
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,440
I never got to be part of a

1144
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,858
team,much less a winning team.

1145
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,151
As a kid I never played sports.

1146
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,528
I was always called the girly

1147
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,113
guy, you know, I was the sissy.

1148
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,447
People would pick on me,

1149
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,740
and I would just give up.

1150
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:13,241
I ended up quitting school

1151
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,535
because people made fun of me.

1152
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:16,619
( voice breaking ): I've given

1153
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,705
up a lot in my life.

1154
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,169
But I wasn't going to let

1155
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,504
anybody make me quit this time,

1156
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,297
no matter how hard it is.

1157
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,674
So nobody was gonna, nobody was

1158
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:30,258
gonna take this away from me,

1159
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,884
and that's why

1160
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,636
I've worked so hard.

1161
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,763
'Cause I'm not quitting.

1162
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,948
>> Well, we didn't get immunity.

1163
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:56,117
The final challenge.

1164
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,953
Today we lost our last shot

1165
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:00,246
at immunity.

1166
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,623
We had a great lead.

1167
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,250
We just suck at puzzles.

1168
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,627
And it's, like, what can we do?

1169
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:10,882
It's over now.

1170
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,341
>> You know,

1171
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,342
we've tried to prepare,

1172
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,761
we've tried to strategize, we've

1173
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:15,595
tried this, tried...

1174
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,054
nothing has worked for this

1175
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:17,555
tribe-- I mean, nothing.

1176
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,807
In a way I feel like, you know,

1177
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:20,349
I lost the thing today, you

1178
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,100
know?

1179
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,144
I felt like I was focused.

1180
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,145
I felt like Stephenie

1181
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:24,771
was focused.

1182
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,314
I thought we were gonna win.

1183
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,607
I don't know.

1184
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,983
I've done all the grunting and

1185
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:29,567
getting and going and climbing

1186
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,109
and swinging from vines

1187
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,487
and all that that I can do,

1188
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,529
and now it's gonna be

1189
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,614
between she and I.

1190
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,907
I don't want to go home--

1191
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,491
I'm gonna feel like a failure

1192
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,158
if I go home right now.

1193
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,201
You know how bad I'll feel?

1194
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,036
>> That's what I said,

1195
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:40,912
that's what I said.

1196
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:41,871
>> Like, you know, like...

1197
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:42,455
>> To not win one immunity?

1198
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,123
I know.

1199
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,625
Tonight we will go to Tribal

1200
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:46,584
Council, and there will be

1201
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:47,668
an individual immunity up for

1202
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:48,753
grabs, some sort of challenge,

1203
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:49,921
and we're gonna compete

1204
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:50,880
against one another

1205
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:53,174
to see who stays in the game.

1206
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,103
>> There we go.

1207
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,063
There we go.

1208
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:10,191
Damn.

1209
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,276
You always get it started.

1210
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,361
You think, like, tonight whoever

1211
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,780
stays will come back here

1212
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,156
by themself?

1213
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:17,406
>> Mm-hmm.

1214
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,492
>> It's kind of scary,

1215
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,368
because I don't know

1216
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:20,785
what's gonna happen.

1217
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,286
Like, Ulong will then be down

1218
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,204
to one remaining member, and I

1219
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,791
guess that person will come back

1220
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,334
here by themselves?

1221
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,877
It's gonna be tough, just one

1222
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:30,962
person trying to do fire,

1223
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:31,712
water, go fishing.

1224
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:32,547
>> Yeah.

1225
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,714
>> It was scary

1226
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,674
just coming back here

1227
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:35,258
with Bobby Jon, but at least I

1228
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,593
knew I had him, because he does

1229
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:38,219
a lot of the work around camp

1230
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,054
that I can't do.

1231
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:41,514
So if I'm here by myself,

1232
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,390
that will be really scary.

1233
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,809
>> It's gonna be weird.

1234
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,269
>> I know.

1235
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,020
( laughs )

1236
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,188
>> There may never be a merge,

1237
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,900
and it may just keep on going

1238
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,902
one at a time, and if it does,

1239
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:55,403
then I'm prepared for it.

1240
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,613
I'm good at getting fire,

1241
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,031
I know where every coconut tree

1242
00:35:59,115 --> 00:35:59,615
is, I know where every little

1243
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,576
fishing hole is,

1244
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,368
so I can stay out here

1245
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:07,248
for weeks by myself.

1246
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,250
>> It's tough because we were

1247
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,043
teammates all along, and now

1248
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,461
we're competing

1249
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,421
against one another.

1250
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,797
So it's do or die.

1251
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,132
If I don't win tonight,

1252
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:17,550
I'm out of the game completely.

1253
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,176
If I win tonight, there is

1254
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,344
a whole variety of things

1255
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,387
that could happen.

1256
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,222
Hey, we need to talk

1257
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,640
'cause I, like, have no idea

1258
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:25,600
what the hell

1259
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,726
this immunity thing could be.

1260
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:27,518
It's definitely a challenge,

1261
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,895
but what kind, do you think?

1262
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:29,437
>> Stephenie thinks nonstop.

1263
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,606
I think she even thinks

1264
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:32,523
when she sleeps.

1265
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,733
So she's thinking right now.

1266
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:34,609
"How am I gonna kick

1267
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,276
Bobby Jon's ass?"

1268
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,569
That's just how she is,

1269
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:37,904
and when it comes down

1270
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:38,988
to being, you know,

1271
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,364
bad-ass to bad-ass,

1272
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,449
I'll-I'll get... I'll get

1273
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,452
just as bad-ass with anybody.

1274
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,829
>> Let's go.

1275
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:47,705
>> Let's do it.

1276
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:48,664
>> All right.

1277
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:49,582
>> I been doing

1278
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:50,458
this little team thing,

1279
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,792
and that's fine and cute,

1280
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,419
and I enjoy it and it's great.

1281
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,171
But I'm kind of getting tired

1282
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:55,588
of the team thing.

1283
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,632
It's done, you know?

1284
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,050
This is team Bobby Jon

1285
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:02,929
right now.

1286
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,417
>> PROBST: So, what's it like

1287
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,795
being a tribe of two?

1288
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:36,504
This is new.

1289
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,714
Steph, what was it like today?

1290
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,883
>> Um, just enjoyed our time

1291
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,385
together and just talked, and,

1292
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,344
you know, we both think that

1293
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,096
the strongest members

1294
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:45,846
of Ulong remaining,

1295
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,473
and whoever wins tonight

1296
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:48,683
deserves to be here.

1297
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,850
>> PROBST: Was today a little

1298
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,102
bit bittersweet?

1299
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:51,477
It's almost like

1300
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,772
you're the final two,

1301
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:55,856
but we're barely halfway

1302
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,566
into this game.

1303
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,442
>> You know, it's, like,

1304
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,610
oh, we're the last two,

1305
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:00,319
but, you know,

1306
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,362
we've only knocked, like, one

1307
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,280
little notch out of the game.

1308
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,323
There's, like,

1309
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,200
so many things left to do.

1310
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:07,827
You got to go all the way,

1311
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:08,911
and, you know, half's nothing.

1312
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:09,704
>> PROBST: Has there been

1313
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:10,579
a highlight for you

1314
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,747
in these first 21 days,

1315
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:12,039
Bobby Jon?

1316
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:12,498
>> I think today was,

1317
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:15,042
to be honest with you.

1318
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,419
Catching, like, fish and, like,

1319
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,461
having success,

1320
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,546
you really learn that,

1321
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,964
you know, hey, you know,

1322
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,549
you can get by, and you can live

1323
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,551
off, you know, Mother Nature.

1324
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,677
>> PROBST: Steph, how do you

1325
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,720
feel about your ability to

1326
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:26,637
survive?

1327
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:27,972
Have you learned a few things?

1328
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:28,764
>> I have.

1329
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:29,765
I learned a lot from

1330
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:30,474
Bobby Jon, actually.

1331
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:30,891
Still not so good

1332
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:31,392
at spearing fish, but...

1333
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,435
uh, I know how to...

1334
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,311
>> She can get coconuts,

1335
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:35,021
>> ...coconuts...

1336
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,063
>> ...she can get crabs,

1337
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:36,564
and she can start a fire.

1338
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,649
>> I don't know how good myself,

1339
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,400
but...

1340
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,693
>> She can do anything a man

1341
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:42,028
can do,I'll tell you that.

1342
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:42,862
>> PROBST: Bobby Jon,

1343
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,572
what would you say after 21 days

1344
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:45,906
is the key to survival?

1345
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,907
What have you learned

1346
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:47,658
that's most important?

1347
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:48,784
>> Fire. Fire.

1348
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:49,827
Definitely fire.

1349
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:50,911
>> PROBST: Ability to make it?

1350
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,163
Keep it going?

1351
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,164
>> Both.

1352
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,081
>> Ability it make it

1353
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,124
and keep it going.

1354
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:55,666
You know, we came in today

1355
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,417
and it was out,

1356
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,544
and we had to restart it.

1357
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,087
You know, we just kind of looked

1358
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,213
at each other like,

1359
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,381
oh, no, here we go again.

1360
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:02,757
This could take

1361
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,466
an hour or longer.

1362
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,259
>> PROBST: So, Steph,

1363
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:06,469
would you agree with Bobby Jon--

1364
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:06,969
is fire most essential?

1365
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,554
I'm, like, frantic without fire.

1366
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:09,930
Absolutely.

1367
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,098
>> PROBST: All right,

1368
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,099
let's get to your

1369
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:12,933
immunity challenge.

1370
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:13,559
You want to know what it is?

1371
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:14,602
>> Yeah.

1372
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,436
>> Yes.

1373
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,313
>> PROBST: It shouldn't surprise

1374
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:17,480
you.

1375
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:20,483
It is the key to survival:

1376
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,443
the ability to make fire.

1377
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,737
>> Oh, my God.

1378
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,072
>> PROBST: You're both gonna

1379
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,948
have 25 matches.

1380
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,825
You will have a box of kindling

1381
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,577
and coconut husk.

1382
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,370
The first person to build a fire

1383
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:33,871
with a flame high enough

1384
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,539
to light their torch wins

1385
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,751
immunity, stays in the game.

1386
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:41,796
Loser... goes home.

1387
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,506
Both feel confident

1388
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,925
in your fire-making skills?

1389
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:48,177
>> Yeah.

1390
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,637
>> I'm not that good.

1391
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,806
>> PROBST: All right, take a

1392
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:52,431
spot over there, and we'll get

1393
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,642
started.

1394
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,520
>> Oh, man.

1395
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,823
>> Good luck.

1396
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,074
>> PROBST: Here we go.

1397
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:11,992
Survivors ready.

1398
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,578
Begin.

1399
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,663
Bobby Jon going right

1400
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:16,622
for the coconut husk.

1401
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:19,166
They each have the same box

1402
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,918
of kindling and coconut husk.

1403
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:24,213
And the same amount of matches.

1404
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:25,589
And Steph going

1405
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:29,343
for the coconut husk.

1406
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:41,105
Bobby Jon has fire first.

1407
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:46,694
Steph right behind.

1408
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,612
Steph blowing on it.

1409
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,322
That's using your brains.

1410
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:54,076
Steph has a big flame.

1411
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,709
Bobby Jon trying to keep up.

1412
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:05,129
Steph has a big flame.

1413
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:05,629
Steph's torch is lit!

1414
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:06,714
Just like that,

1415
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,133
this challenge is over.

1416
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,469
Steph wins immunity.

1417
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,804
Bobby Jon, I'm sorry,

1418
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:14,889
for you it's over.

1419
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,640
Steph, go ahead and have a seat

1420
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:17,766
back on the bench.

1421
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,851
Bobby Jon, you need

1422
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:23,731
to get your torch.

1423
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:24,732
>> Hey, good luck.

1424
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:29,236
>> You, too.

1425
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,741
>> Thank you. See ya.

1426
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,576
>> PROBST: Bobby Jon, the tribe

1427
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:35,951
definitely did not

1428
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:36,577
speak tonight.

1429
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,746
Nonetheless, it's time for

1430
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:42,500
you to go.

1431
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:42,750
So long.

1432
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:55,179
>> Thank you, sir.

1433
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:56,722
>> Oh, my God.

1434
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:57,890
This is crazy.

1435
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:58,557
>> PROBST: It's just you.

1436
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,600
>> It's just me now.

1437
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,768
>> PROBST: What do you think

1438
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:01,685
tonight's gonna be like?

1439
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,604
>> It's gonna be scary.

1440
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,064
I mean, I left camp

1441
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,523
with the fire pretty stoked

1442
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,067
and, uh, my bed already made,

1443
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,361
in case I was coming back to it,

1444
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:11,654
and lots of firewood.

1445
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,530
So I'm kind of scared.

1446
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:14,782
Hopefully, I'll have a good

1447
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,033
night, and tomorrow,

1448
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,159
God knows what that brings.

1449
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,285
>> PROBST: We'll see what

1450
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,245
tomorrow brings.

1451
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:19,954
Grab your torch,

1452
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,330
head on back to camp.

1453
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:23,415
You're still alive.

1454
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:37,972
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1455
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,057
from our next episode.

1456
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,227
>> PROBST: Next time on

1457
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,144
<i>Survivor:</i>

1458
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,271
>> The three of us'll go?

1459
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,313
>> PROBST: Tom offends Coby.

1460
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,398
>> I'll be left out

1461
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:47,982
again, as usual.

1462
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:48,732
>> Coby... Coby...

1463
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,818
>> Hello? I'm still here.

1464
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,361
I'm still trying to participate,

1465
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:53,320
you jerks.

1466
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,363
>> PROBST: And Stephenie

1467
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:55,823
struggles alone at Ulong.

1468
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:56,991
>> This is scary as hell.

1469
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,075
This is the scariest thing,

1470
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,285
and the hardest thing

1471
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,662
that I'll ever do.

1472
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:08,043
>> I feel like a brand-new man,

1473
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:08,794
I really do.

1474
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,254
I wish I could keep going--

1475
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:11,880
I have a lot left in me-- but

1476
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,048
hopefully, I can turn that

1477
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,341
energy and that attitude to

1478
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,509
something positive from here on

1479
00:43:15,592 --> 00:43:16,552
out.

1480
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:17,761
I'm definitely proud of

1481
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,013
Stephenie, 'cause I think

1482
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:19,888
she's honestly probably

1483
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,307
the top player in the game.

1484
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,474
I would just tell Stephenie

1485
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:23,434
just keep on doing

1486
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:23,976
what she's doing-- I mean,

1487
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:25,769
the girl's almost invincible.
