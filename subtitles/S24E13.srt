1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:02,001
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:04,087
"SURVIVOR": WITH THE WOMEN

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,048
PICKING OFF THE MEN ONE BY ONE,

4
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:08,216
IT SEEMED OBVIOUS THAT TARZAN

5
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:13,388
WOULD GO NEXT.

6
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:16,307
BUT AN EMOTIONAL VISIT FROM THE

7
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,560
CASTAWAYS' LOVED ONES SET A
DIFFERENT BALL IN MOTION.

8
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:19,269
GO!

9
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,771
IN AN INTENSE AWARD CHALLENGE--

10
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:25,275
WE'RE ALMOST THERE, DAD.

11
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,318
Jeff: KAT WON A TRIP AWAY

12
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,320
FROM CAMP WITH HER LOVED ONE.

13
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:32,407
KAT'S DECISION NOT TO TAKE
TARZAN

14
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,284
AND HIS WIFE OF 30 YEARS AND

15
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,494
CHRISTINA AND HER ALING FATHER

16
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,621
DID NOT SIT WELL WITH SABRINA.

17
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,123
BACK AT CAMP, SABRINA VENTED

18
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,125
ABOUT KAT'S SELFISHNESS.

19
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,960
THIS IS DEFINITELY ENOUGH

20
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:45,754
REASON TO MAKE ME VOTE OFF KAT.

21
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,297
Jeff: IN A GRUELING

22
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,256
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE-- YOU ARE

23
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,300
HAVING TO EARN IT RIGHT HERE--

24
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:53,094
KAT FOUGHT TO THE BITTER END,

25
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,304
BUT IT WAS KIM HOPREVAILED.

26
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:59,267
KIM WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.

27
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,645
AFTER THE CHALLENGE, ALICIA

28
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,271
JOINED THE SWELLING TIDE TO TAKE

29
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:06,775
OUT KAT.

30
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,652
KIM, WANTING TO KEEP HER OPTIONS

31
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,987
OPEN, WASN'T SO SURE.

32
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,864
I DO THINK KAT HAS A GOOD

33
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,824
SHOT AT GETTING A LOT OF JURY

34
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:15,492
VOTES JUST BECAUSE SHE HASN'T

35
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,160
PISSED A LOT OF PEOPLE OFF BUT I

36
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,162
THINK SABRINA IS SMART ENOUGH TO

37
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,122
SWAY THE JURY AND TOTALLY SCREW

38
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:21,664
ME OVER IN THE END.

39
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,666
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

40
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,335
KAT FELT VERY CONFIDENT.

41
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,170
IF IT IS GOING TO BE A

42
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,338
BLINDSIDE, IT'S GOING TO BE

43
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,340
PRETTY FUNNY AND PRETTY, LIKE--

44
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:30,882
LIKE, EXCITING.

45
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:37,680
Jeff: BUT KIM HAD TO

46
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,015
DECIDE.

47
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:40,016
DEVASTATING KAT, AND SHAKING UP

48
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:40,683
THE GAME.

49
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,228
KAT, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

50
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,021
WILL THE WOMEN CONTINUE TO TAKE

51
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:45,855
OUT THEIR OWN?

52
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,191
OR WILL TARZAN, THE LAST MAN

53
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,359
STANDING, BE THE NEXT TO GO?

54
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,194
SIX ARE LEFT, WHO WILL BE VOTED

55
00:01:51,277 --> 00:02:01,371
OUT TONIGHT?

56
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:15,426
OUT TONIGHT?

57
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,594
MAN.

58
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:17,387
OH, MY GOD.

59
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,930
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT DAMAGE

60
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:19,556
CONTROL.

61
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,891
HER LAST STATEMENT WAS HOW

62
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,101
FUNNY A BLINDSIDE IS.

63
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,394
OH, MY GOD!

64
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,354
HOW IRONIC WAS THAT?

65
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:30,441
FIWERE-- IF I WERE THE GIRLS,

66
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,860
I WOULD HAVE VOTED MEET OUT

67
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:32,735
BEFORE KAT.

68
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,444
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE

69
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,071
SMARTEST THING THEY COULD DO BUT

70
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:35,822
THEY DIDN'T DO IT.

71
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:40,952
AND NOW THAT THEY'VE DONE THAT,

72
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,745
I HAVE A SUBPLOT WHERE I MIGHT

73
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,414
BE ABLE TO ARRANGE MYSELF TO BE

74
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,082
THE TOP THREE.

75
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:47,834
BUT OF COURSE I WOULDN'T REVEAL

76
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,210
ANY OF THAT RIGHT NOW.

77
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,420
I'M JUST HOPING TO MAKE IT TO

78
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,756
FOUR.

79
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,424
YOU'RE NOT OPPOSED TO ME GETTING

80
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,425
DOWN TO NUMBER FOUR, RIGHT?

81
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,384
NOT AT ALL.

82
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,262
OKAY, SO I'M THINKING THE

83
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,681
BEST THING FOR YOU LADIES WOULD

84
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:06,060
BE FOR YOU, ALICIA, AND

85
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,396
CHRISTINA TO BE THE LAST THREE

86
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,814
STANDING, BECAUSE NOBODY WILL

87
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:10,315
VOTE FOR CHRISTINA.

88
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,108
I KNOW.

89
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,736
AND IF I GO ON THE JURY, I

90
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,987
THINK I CAN CONVINCE THEM TO

91
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,071
VOTE FOR YOU.

92
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,115
HERE'S MY ONLY CONCERN.

93
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:19,782
YEAH.

94
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,243
IS I JUST START TO WONDER IF

95
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,286
ALICIA IS REALLY GOING TO WANT

96
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:23,953
TO TAKE ME.

97
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,289
OKAY, WELL, I THINK ALICIA

98
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:31,294
HAS A STRONG AFFINITY FOR YOU AS

99
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,671
FAR AS JUST LIKING YOU AND

100
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:34,797
WANTING TO BE YOUR FRIEND AND,

101
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,424
YOU KNOW, GO WITH WHATEVER YOU

102
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:37,008
SAY.

103
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,468
BUT HERE'S THE THING, THE

104
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,303
BIGGEST THREAT IS--

105
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:40,762
CHELSEA.

106
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:41,471
CHELSEA.

107
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:41,971
AND SHE'S MY FRIEND.

108
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:42,555
I KNOW, I KNOW.

109
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,642
IT'S SO HARD.

110
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,810
WHEN WE GOT BACK FROM TRIBAL

111
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,646
TONIGHT TARZAN PULLED ME ASIDE

112
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,773
AND WANTED TO TELL ME WHAT HE

113
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,608
THOUGHT THE BEST PLAN FOR ME WAS

114
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,610
AND THAT IS I GET RID OF CHELSEA

115
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,988
AND ALICIA, AND AS CRAZY AS

116
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,532
TARZAN IS, IT IS WHAT I KNOW TO

117
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,659
BE TRUE.

118
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,160
IF I SEND CHELSEA HOME, THAT

119
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:06,287
WILL BE MY WORST NIGHT HERE.

120
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,503
YOU ALL STAY AND I'LL GO.

121
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,381
OKAY.

122
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,925
WHEN YOU--

123
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,135
WAIT, DO YOU THINK-- MY THING

124
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,680
IS I KNOW I CAN BEAT CHRISTINA,

125
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:24,514
BUT DO YOU THINK I CAN WIN

126
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,475
AGAINST-- KIM, KIM IS MY WHOLE--

127
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,352
MY PLAN IS TO HYPE IT UP FOR

128
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,522
YOU WHEN I GET ON THE JURY.

129
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,524
SEE, AND I DON'T THINK IT WILL

130
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,193
BE HARD TO DO AT ALL.

131
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:38,861
BECAUSE THEY FEEL BETRAYED BY

132
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:39,487
HER.

133
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,530
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS IN

134
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,197
SEGMENTS.

135
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,198
DON'T BE THE FIRST ONE VOTE OUT.

136
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:44,701
MAKE IT TO THE MERGE, MAKE IT TO

137
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,702
SEEING MY WIFE.

138
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,537
MAKING IT TO NUMBER FOUR.

139
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,038
AND MAYBE SLIPPING INTO NUMBER

140
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:49,747
THREE.

141
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,873
EVEN IF I MAKE IT TO THREE, AND

142
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:51,499
I LOSE, IT WON'T BE A TERRIBLE

143
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:52,208
THING.

144
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,460
I JUST WON'T BUY SHOCKS FOR MY

145
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:54,877
CAR.

146
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,547
THAT'S ALL.

147
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:30,246
LOOK, THIS IS A CUP.

148
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:32,790
LOOK HOW MUCH IS INSIDE OF IT.

149
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:33,583
IT MIGHT JUST BE BETTER TO

150
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,376
SAVE IT FOR DINNER.

151
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,295
RIGHT NOW, I FEEL LIKE THE

152
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,756
GAME IS THREE VERSUS THREE.

153
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,592
SABRINA, KIM, AND I, AND ALICIA,
CHRISTINA AND TARZAN.

154
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:47,096
I GENUINELY THINK THAT ALICIA,

155
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,640
CHRISTINA AND TARZAN THINK THEY

156
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,267
HAVE KIM IN THEIR ALLIANCE,

157
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,894
WHICH IS GREAT, BECAUSE I KNOW

158
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:57,607
THAT SHE'S GOT MY BACK.

159
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,818
DUE, I'VE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT

160
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,779
FOOD ALL NIGHT, AND I WAS JUST

161
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,239
LIKE WHY DO I KEEP ON DREAMING

162
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,407
ABOUT FOOD?

163
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:10,286
TODAY'S REWARD, I SOMEHOW

164
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,496
PULL OUT A WINNER, THEN I THINK

165
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,497
YOU NEED TO GO.

166
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,498
YOU'RE SO SWEET.

167
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,165
I FEEL THE SAME.

168
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,584
I'M TRYING TO REEL CHRISTINA

169
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,336
IN A LITTLE BIT.

170
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,005
I KNOW THAT CHRISTINA IS

171
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,381
ALICIA'S PUPPET, AND I'M TRYING

172
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,134
TO HELP HER SEE THE BIG SCHEME

173
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,469
OF THINGS, THE BIG PICTURE.

174
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,553
I THINK ALICIA WANTS TO TAKE YOU

175
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,472
AND TARZAN.

176
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,515
BUT I THINK JUST BECAUSE HE'S A

177
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,017
MALE AND ALL THOSE GUYS ARE

178
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,270
PISSED AT THE GIRLS, THAT

179
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,648
THEY'RE GONNA VOTE FOR HIM, AND

180
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,067
THAT MEANS HE CAN'T GO TO THE

181
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:41,776
END.

182
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,152
IF I CAN GET CHRISTINA TO SEE

183
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:43,861
THAT TARZAN CAN'T GO TO THE

184
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,155
FINAL THREE, MAYBE SHE'LL FALL

185
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,824
IN WITH KIM AND I.

186
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,158
I FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE SOME KIND

187
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,660
OF BOND WITH ALICIA.

188
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,454
SO IF YOU COULD KEEP THAT

189
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,705
BETWEEN US BECAUSE I'M JUST

190
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,707
TALKING OUT LOUD RIGHT NOW.

191
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,333
BUT--

192
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,753
YEAH, I'LL JUST KEEP IT QU

193
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,297
QUIET.

194
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:03,840
SHUT UP.

195
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,967
NO KIDDING, NO JOKE.

196
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,135
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

197
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,553
IF THERE WAS AN AWARD

198
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,847
CHALLENGE AND SHE COULD TAKE TWO

199
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,015
SHE SAID,"I'M GOING TO TAKE

200
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,600
YOU."

201
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:18,312
AND THEN SHE SAID ME, AND ALICIA
AND TARZAN ARE IN ALLIANCE FOR
THE FINAL THREE.

202
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:22,024
WHEN CHELSEA AND CHRISTINA

203
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,360
WENT TO TREE MAIL, CHRISTINA

204
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:25,778
TOLD US EVERYTHING CHELSEA SAID

205
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:26,404
ON THEIR WALK.

206
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,531
MY FIRST QUESTION I WANTED

207
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,116
ANSWER WAS DID CHELSEA BLOW MY

208
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,075
COVER BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN

209
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,535
PLAYING BOTH SIDES?

210
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,995
ALICIA, TARZAN, AND CHRISTINA

211
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,705
ALL THINK I MAKE A FOUR SOME

212
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,374
FOR THEM, AND THEN CHELSEA AND

213
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:40,710
SABRINA THINK I AM THEIR THIRD.

214
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,005
SHUT UP.

215
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,715
I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S THEM

216
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:46,549
RIGHT NOW.

217
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,717
IT'S THEM AGAINST US.

218
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,760
GOD, THAT MAKES ME WANT TO

219
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,096
KICK CHRISTINA'S ASS.

220
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:52,889
DON'T SAY A WORD.

221
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:53,556
I WON'T.

222
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,308
IT WILL RUIN IT.

223
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,100
SETTING YOURSELF UP IN A

224
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,351
POSITION TO PLAY BOTH SIDES IS

225
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,019
BRILLIANT BUT IT'S ALSO ONE OF

226
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,563
THE SCARIER PLACES TO SIT IN

227
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,940
THIS GAME BECAUSE IT JUST TAKES

228
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:03,691
ONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN TWO

229
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,026
PEOPLE ON OPPOSITE SIDES TO PUT

230
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,444
IT ALL TOGETHER AND THEN YOU'RE

231
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,070
THE FIRST PERSON GONE BECAUSE

232
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,198
NOBODY TRUSTS YOU ANYMORE.

233
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:21,876
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

234
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,752

AROUND IT.

241
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:30,760
THIS WILL MAKE YOU DIZZY.

242
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:34,305
YOU'LL TAKE THE DISK, MOVE TO

00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:36,933
DO IT AGAIN.

245
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,267
ONCE YOU'VE COLLECTED ALL THREE

246
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:38,643
DISKS, YOU WILL USE THEM TO FORM

247
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,436
A DECODER.

248
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,604
YOU'LL USE THE DECODER TO GIVE

249
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,648
YOU THE THREE NUMBERS YOU NEED

250
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,067

FOR?

255
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,280
YES.

256
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:51,948
YES.

257
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,074
Jeff: THE WINNER OF TODAY'S

258
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:53,741

00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:58,162
TAKEN TO A YACHT.

CHELSEA THINKS SHE HAS IT, AND

00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,939
SHE'S GOING TO GIVE IT A GO.

313
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,108
IT IS NOT RIGHT.

314
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,778
YOU MAY HAVE THE RIGHT THREE

315
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:54,487

Jeff: THE THREE OF YOU ARE

377
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,456
GOING TO HAVE A WONDERFUL

378
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,498
AFTERNOON.

379
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,000
ALICIA, TARZAN, CHRISTINA, GOT

380
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:31,709
NOTHING FOR YOU.

381
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,711
GRAB YOUR STUFF AND HEAD BACK TO

382
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:34,295
CAMP.

383
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,045
GUYS, GRAB YOUR STUFF.

384
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,839
HEAD OUT.

385
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:37,673
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

386
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:38,716
THANK YOU, JEFF.

387
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,843
Jeff: NICE WORK.

388
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:57,860
LADIES, YOUR CABIN.

389
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,862
COOL!

390
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,822
OKAY, THIS IS YOUR CABIN.

391
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,532
YOUR CLEAN CLOTHES.

392
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,577
I'VE NEVER ONCE BEEN ON A

393
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,286
SAILBOAT.

394
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,538
NOT ONLY A SAILBOUT BUT THIS HAS

395
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,332
TO BE ONE OF THE NICEST

396
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:11,790
SAILBOATS EVER.

397
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,126
YOU SHOWER FIRST.

398
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:14,543
REALLY?

399
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,169
YES.

400
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,921
IT'S GOT A FULL KITCHEN, A

401
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:17,838
BEDROOM, A SHOWER.

402
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,757
I MEAN, IT'S THE WORKS.

403
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,466
OH, MY GOSH!

404
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,426
I WAS IN THE SHOWER FOR PROBABLY

405
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,093
30 MINUTES.

406
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,470
I MEAN I SCRUBBED, AND JUST

407
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,764
KNOWING THAT I'M CLEAN NOW MAKES

408
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,557
A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE.

409
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,059
ALL RIGHT, CHEERS, TO THE END.

410
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,602
ALL THE WAY.

411
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:32,895
ALL THE WAY.

412
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,104
OH, MY GOD.

413
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,356
CHELSEA, DARLING.

414
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,399
OH, YOU LOOK SO AMAZING.

415
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,567
I'M A NEW WOMAN.

416
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,110
HERE'S YOUR CENTER SEAT.

417
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,780
YOU LOOK SO PRETTY!

418
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,615
WHENEVER YOU STEP OUT OF THE

419
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,158
GAME AND YOU GET TO GO ON THESE

420
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,203
REWARDS, IT'S LIKE YOU FEEL LIKE

421
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,079
YOU'RE HUMAN AGAIN.

422
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,748
I'LL SEE YOU, LADIES.

423
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,083
I MEAN, I KIND OF KNOW WHAT'S

424
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,752
GOING ON BACK AT CAMP, SO SINCE

425
00:13:56,835 --> 00:14:02,341
I DO, I CAN COME OUT HERE AND

426
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,884
RELAX AND THE THREE OF US WILL

427
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,719
TRY TO WORK IT OUT AND MAKE TO

428
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,263
THE END TOGETHER.

429
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,556
WOW, I LOVE CHAMPAGNE.

430
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,098
DO YOU LOVE THAT?

431
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,101
I LOVE YOU.

432
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:12,518
YES, THIS IS REAL GOOD.

433
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,395
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

434
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,896
OH, MY GOD.

435
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,315
THE THING IS I THINK WE CAN DO

436
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,024
IT.

437
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:19,608
THAT'S WHAT I GET EXCITED ABOUT.

438
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,443
I FEEL LIKE WE'RE ON A

439
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:21,777
HONEYMOON RIGHT NOW.

440
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,486
WE ARE.

441
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,780
YOU START TO FEEL LIKE AN ANIMAL

442
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:25,447
OUT HERE.

443
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,950
YOU GET REAL SAVAGE SO TO JUST

444
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,368
GO AND BE WAITED ON AND TO FEEL

445
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,744
SO PAMPERED, I STARTED TO

446
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,788
REMEMBER WHOIS AND WHAT I'M

447
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:33,789
ABOUT AND WHAT I'M DOING HERE.

448
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:35,916
I FEEL LIKE MY HEAD IS SO MUCH

449
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,959
CLEARER TODAY THAN IT WAS

450
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,169
YESTERDAY SO THE REWARD WAS HUGE

451
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:47,177
FOR ME.

452
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,597
I'M-- I'M LIVID.

453
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,139
OH, YOU'RE LIVID.

454
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,141
SO AM I.

455
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,311
SO, CHELSEA WAS ASKED, "WHO

456
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,061
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO ON THE

457
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,314
REWARD WITH?"

458
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,857
AND HER RESPONSE S, I'M GOING TO

459
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,150
PICK THE PERSON HOW I PLAY THE

460
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,484
GAME, WHICH IS FAIR."

461
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,486
SO WHO DOES SHE PICK?

462
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,195
KIM.

463
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,155
WHY THE HELL DOES KIM NEED TO GO

464
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,157
ON A THIRD REWARD.

465
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,159
TELL ME TO MY FACE, THAT WAS A

466
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:10,868
FAIR CHOICE.

467
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:13,162
NO, AND NOT ONLY THAT, ON THE

468
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,706
WALK FROM TREE MAIL--

469
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,834
SHE SAID SHE WOULD TAKE YOU.

470
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:19,543
THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

471
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,838
US THREE DON'T BUDGE ON WHO WE

472
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:23,422
VOTE NEXT.

473
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,673
WHO ARE WE VOTING FOR?

474
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,216
WE'RE VOTING FOR CHELSEA.

475
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,802
THAT MEANS OUR THREE VOTES

476
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:29,970
NEED TO BE ALIGNED.

477
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,555
THEIR THREE VOTES ARE GOING TO

478
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,389
BE A TIE.

479
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,807
THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO FORCE ONE

480
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,017
OF THEM, WHICH WOULD BE KIM, TO

481
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,226
STICK TRUE TO WHAT SHE SAID.

482
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,854
KIM AND I TRUST EACH OTHER BUT

483
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:40,856
I'M NOT GOING TO PASS IT BY HER

484
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:44,193
THAT SHE'S NOT THINKING OF, YOU

485
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,654
KNOW, OTHER THINGS, OTHER

486
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,321
OPTIONS.

487
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,030
HOWEVER I THINK IT IS STUPID

488
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,990
THAT SHE WOULD WANT TO SIT NEXT

489
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,743
TO SABRINA AND CHELSEA.

490
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,536
TARZAN, MYSELF AND CHRISTINA ARE

491
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,205
SOLID AND IF THEY WANT TO BE

492
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,207
SOLID, COOL, LET THEM BE SOILED.

493
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,375
LET THEM DRAW ROCKS.

494
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,167
LET THEM BE STUPID.

495
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,544
WHEN THEY COME BACK, IF KIM

496
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,381
COMES BACK AND SAYS LET'S NOT DO

497
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,215
CHELSEA, LET'S DO, BLAH, BLAH,

498
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,176
BLAH, THAT WOULD BE A DEAD GIVE

499
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:09,843
AWAY.

500
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:10,552
THE TWO BIG PLAYERS WHO WILL

501
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,221
KNOCK YOU GUYS OUT OF THE LAST

502
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,057
THREE ARE KIM AND CHELSEA AND I
BELIEVE THEY'RE DECEIVING US AND
THAT THEY'RE A TEAM.

503
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,141
SO I THINK YOU GUYS HAVE A

504
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,226
BETTER CHANCE IF I'M ONE OF THE

505
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,020
THREE ACTUALLY BECAUSE THOSE

506
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,773
THREE LADIES TOOK OFF.

507
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,149
IT'S SORT OF ALMOST A BLESSING

508
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,360
IN DISGUISE BECAUSE IT HELPED

509
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,278
UNITE ANOTHER PLOT THAT MIGHT

510
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,780
ALLOW ME TO SAY HERE POSSIBLY TO

511
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,783
THE LAST THREE.

512
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:33,450
SO--

513
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:34,535
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?

514
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:35,244
WOULD YOU RATHER SIT NEXT TO HIM

515
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,579
OR WOULD YOU RATHER SIT NEXT TO

516
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,163
KIM?

517
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:38,914
I'M GOING TO BE PERFECTLY

518
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:39,581
HONEST, I THINK KIM IS PROBABLY

519
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,250
GOING TO GET MORE VOTES VERSUS

520
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:41,917
TARZAN.

521
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,669
IT'S NOT MUCH OF A THREAT.

522
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:44,753
ALL RIGHT, SO THIS IS THE

523
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,629
NEXT MOVE.

524
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,590
CHELSEA OR KIM.

525
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,299
I'M ACTUALLY LEANING TOWARDS

526
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,970
TAKING TARZAN TO THE TOP THREE

527
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,388
WITH CHRISTINA AND I.

528
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,306
SO KIM BETTER COME BACK WITH THE

529
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,266
RIGHT STORY THAT WE'RE STILL

530
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,394
STICKING TO CHELSEA, AND WHO

531
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,103
KNOWS?

532
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,646
AFTER CHELSEA'S GONE, YOU KNOW

533
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,355
WHAT?

534
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,314
TARZAN HAS A GREAT POINT-- WE

535
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,317
NEED TO TAKE HIM OUT.

536
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:11,238
I LOVE ME SOME GRILLED

537
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:11,613
VEGGIE.

538
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,281
WOW!

539
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,949
OH, MY GOD, IF I WAS BACK AT

540
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:15,451
CAMP RIGHT NOW, I'D BE A MESS.

541
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,078
I'D BE SOMEWHERE BALLED UP

542
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:18,662
CRYING.

543
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,288
I'D BE TRYING TO DROWN.

544
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,623
THIS IS WHAT-- THIS IS THE

545
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,332
DETERMINING FACTOR.

546
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,625
IT'S EITHER GOING TO BE US OR

547
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,460
IT'S GOING TO BE THEM.

548
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,335
GOTCHA.

549
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,796
AS LONG AS THEIR VOTES ARE

550
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,131
SPLIT, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

551
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:29,757
RIGHT.

552
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,215
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE EVEN

553
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:30,924
QUESTIONING ME.

554
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,886
I DON'T THINK THEY EVER HAVE.

555
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,637
SOMEBODY HAS TO MAKE A BIG

556
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,346
MOVE.

557
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,306
KIM HAS AN AMAZING ABILITY TO

558
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,849
LOOK AT YOU, ALMOST LOOK THROUGH

559
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:41,310
YOU AND SAY, "YEAH, I'M WITH

560
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,978
YOU," AND IT'S BELIEVABLE.

561
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:44,313
YOU HAVE SUCH A PURE EFFECT ON

562
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:44,980
THEM.

563
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:47,483
YOU JUST LOOK AT THEM AND THE

564
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:47,983
BIG BABY BLUES.

565
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,318
I'M SCAERG MYSELF.

566
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,194
I CAN'T TELL WHEN I'M TELLING

567
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,654
THE TRUTH OR NOT.

568
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,198
THE REWARD, I THINK IT CLEARED

569
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,991
THE LINE FOR ME A LITTLE BIT.

570
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:57,034
I FEEL BETTER ABOUT THE OPTION

571
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,952
OF GOING WITH CHELSEA AND

572
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,162
SABRINA THAN JUST TRYING TO

573
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,705
FIGURE OUT ANY WAY POSSIBLE THAT

574
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,165
WE CAN SOMEHOW WIN THIS NEXT

575
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,416
VOTE WITH THREE VOTES.

576
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,502
WE GOTTA WIN TOMORROW.

577
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,310
MY PLANS FOR THE DAY, THE

578
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,187
FIRST THING I'M GOING TO DO IS

579
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,023
FIX ME SOME COCONUT STEW, START

580
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:30,400
THE FIRE, CLEAN MY CLOTHES, WASH

581
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:34,279
MY HAIR AGAIN.

582
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,823
I PREPARE TO BE DEFEATED IN SOME

583
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:39,159
KIND OF CONTEST LATER TODAY.

584
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,830
DEFEATED BY THE FEMININE GENDER.

585
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,165
FAILURE AMONG MEN.

586
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,209
I CAN DWRAIT MORE OF THIS.

587
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,002
NO, I'M GOING TO COOK IT THIS

588
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,379
MORNING THE WAY I WANT TO, OKAY.

589
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,048
SO DON'T BOTHER ME ABOUT IT.

590
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:54,383
AND WHAT WAY ARE YOU COOKING

591
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:54,883
IT?

592
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:55,425
THE WAY YOU WANT TO.

593
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,678
BUT, NO, HOW ARE YOU

594
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:58,220
PREPARING IT?

595
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:04,351
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

596
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,061
SO, SO.

597
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:07,187
SAME BUGS THAT WERE ON YOUR

598
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:07,855
SKIN.

599
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:08,564
I'M SURE CHRISTINA WOULD BE

600
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,941
MORE THAN WILLING TO LET YOU USE

601
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:11,483
HERS.

602
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,943
DON'T TOUCH MY BUFF!

603
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,069
I'M CLEANING MY BUFF RIGHT NOW.

604
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,946
I'VE HAD TO ENTER BATTLES

605
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,072
WITH MY BARE HANDS.

606
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:18,615
WHEN WE WENT OFF, YOU KNOW,

607
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,742
ON THE REWARD CHALLENGE WE GOT

608
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,702
STUFF AWAY FROM THE GAME, ALL

609
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,745
THE ARGUING, AND COMING BACK

610
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,454
HERE, THE SECOND WE WALK INTO

611
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,874
CAMP, THERE'S AN ARGUMENT, AND

612
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,584
IT'S JUST LIKE OH, WE'RE BACK IN

613
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,295
IT AGAIN.

614
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:35,007
TARZAN WAS LIKE IF KIM COMES

615
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,426
BACK SAYING A DIFFERENT TUNE,

616
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,970
SINGING A DIFFERENT TUNE GO BWHO

617
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,597
WE SHOULD VOTE, WE KNOW HE'S A

618
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,306
TRAITOR.

619
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,724
HE'S TRYING TO GET YOU ALL TO

620
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,392
TAKE HIM INSTEAD OF ME NOW.

621
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:45,934
SEE, THIS IS INTERESTING.

622
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,228
I DON'T KNOW, I JUST--

623
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,438
MAYBE THIS WAS HIS PLAN TO

624
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:49,980
PLAY STUPID.

625
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,481
I KNOW, I START TO--

626
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,735
TO PLAY STUPID--

627
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,445
IF HE ENDS UP WINNING THIS

628
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,238
THING I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING

629
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,615
WORSE, IT'S LIKE THE MEN WIN IN

630
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,282
THE END.

631
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,450
THE THOUGHT OF THAT MAKES ME

632
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,117
CRINGE.

633
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,452
I THINK THE ONLY REASON ARB

634
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,120
LASCH WOULD BE WILLING TO GIVE

635
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:07,122
UP TARZAN WHO HAS APPEARED TO BE

636
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:08,999
ONE OF HER MINIONS IS SHE'S

637
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,667
CONVINCED HE IS NOT A MINION

638
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,753
AFTER ALL THAT HE'S THE

639
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:13,629
MASTERMIND WHO WAS GOING TO TAKE

640
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,672
OUT HER MASTERMIND AND SHE WAS

641
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:23,096
GOING TO LOOK LIKE A FOOL.

642
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,473
IT'S ( BLEEP ).

643
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,140
HE'S PLAYING US.

644
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:30,979
YEAH.

645
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,441
HE'S GOING TO TAKE CHRISTINA!

646
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,150
AND SABRINA.

647
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:35,484
OH, MY GOD.

648
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,152
OKAY--

649
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:37,736
HE DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE US.

650
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,988
YES, YES, HE'S GOING TO

651
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,782
TAKE-- YOU KNOW WHY-- NO, NO,

652
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:42,449
HOW ABOUT THIS--

653
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:46,161
I JUST REALIZED I ALMOST GOT

654
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:47,537
MY ASS KICKED BY TARZAN.

655
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,456
WHEN KIM CAME BACK TODAY I

656
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,501
HAD TO CONFIDE IN HER AND WE

657
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,210
CROSS-REFERENCED EACH OTHER'S

658
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,128
STORIES AND WE ARE GETTING FED

659
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,505
THE SAME B.S..

660
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,799
HE'S GOING TO TAKE YOU.

661
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,051
I KNOW, WAIT.

662
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:01,760
TARZAN WANTS TO TAKE KIM OUT,

663
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,387
AND THEN SECURE HIS SPOT WITH

664
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,181
CHRISTINA AND SABRINA AND TAKE

665
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:08,558
ME OUT AND MAKE ME LOOK LIKE THE

666
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:08,892
FOOL.

667
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,979
HELL, NO!

668
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:12,688
HELL TO THE NO.

669
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,981
WE'RE GETTING PLAYED.

670
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:14,564
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

671
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,358
WE'RE SAVING OUR BUTTS.

672
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,776
HERE.

673
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,069
OKAY, OKAY.

674
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:19,736
WHAT DID HE TELL YOU--

675
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,864
HE COMES TO ME AND HE'S LIKE

676
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:23,365
CHRISTINA.

677
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,032
AND I SAID, WHAT?

678
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,575
HE SAYS ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT

679
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:25,867
ALICIA?

680
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,036
AND I'M.

681
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,496
OH, MY GOD!

682
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,206
IF DIDN'T REALIZE THIS, I

683
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:32,332
WOULD HAVE GONE STRAIGHT UP

684
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,041
TARZAN.

685
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,001
I WOULD LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT IN

686
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:34,751
FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

687
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:35,544
NOW YOU'RE GETTING ALL PARANOID?

688
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,754
NOW YOU'RE TRYING TO PLAY THE

689
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:38,463
GAME?

690
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:38,880
NOW YOU'RE TRYING TO WORK THE

691
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:39,548
SOCIAL GAME?

692
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,717
I AM THE QUEEN OF THE SOCIAL

693
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,426
GAME.

694
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,052
IF CHELSEA WINS IMMUNITY, WE'RE

695
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:44,928
TAKING TARZAN OUT.

696
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,513
IF CHELSEA DOESN'T WIN IMMUNITY,

697
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,556
THEN CHELSEA GOES HOME.

698
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,391
AND I DON'T FEEL BAD ABOUT THAT

699
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,143
CHOICE, EITHER, BECAUSE HOME

700
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:51,560
GIRL HAS BEEN TRYING TO RUN HER

701
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,228
GAME ON ME.

702
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:55,105
NO ONE RUNS HER GAME ON ME.

703
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,524
THAT'S THE GHETTO PUERTO RICAN

704
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:58,108
COMING OUT.

705
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,736
OH, WELL, I DON'T CARE.

706
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,904
DON'T TRY IT MAKE ME LOOK LIKE A

707
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,239
FOOL BY TRYING TO TAKE ME OUT AT

708
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:05,073
THE END.

709
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,408
I'M THE MOST POWERFUL PLAYER AND

710
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,243
I'M GOING TO REMAIN THE MOST

711
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:14,041
POWERFUL PLAYER.

712
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:20,047

717
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,219

00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,445
COMPLETE A PUZZLE IN THE SHAPE

727
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,571
OF A FISH SKELETON.

728
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,115
TO MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE

729
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,283
INTERESTING, YOU'LL DO IT WITH

730
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,910
ONE HAND TIED BEHIND YOUR BACK.

731
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:52,120

SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT OF

00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:01,963
THE GAME.

739
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:02,964
LET'S DRAW FOR SPOTS.

740
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:07,052

00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,637

00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,117
ABOUT HOW INCONSISTENT HE'S

938
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,785
BEEN, WHAT HE SAID TO ALICIA.

939
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:06,369
THEY'RE FLOORED.

940
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:06,995
OH, MY GOD.

941
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,621
THEY'RE AS EXCITED TO TAKE

942
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,623
HIM OUT AS THEY WERE TO TAKE KAT

943
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:10,915
OUT.

944
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:11,207
WHAT.

945
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:11,875
I SWEAR.

946
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,669
SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER, KIM HAS

947
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:16,004
FINAGLED HER WAY INTO ALICIA'S

948
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,256
MINDSET THAT TARZAN IS GUNNING

949
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,757
FOR ALICIA.

950
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,718
NOW BEFORE, ALICIA, SHE WAS

951
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,178
GUNNING FOR CHELSEA FIRST.

952
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,639
BUT WHAT I JUST HEARD FROM KIM,

953
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,601
IF IT'S TRUE, WE CAN GET THIS

954
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:30,560
SUCKER TARZAN OUT OF HERE.

955
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,979
BUT ALICIA'S SLICK.

956
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:33,980
WE DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S TELLING

957
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,565
THE TRUTH.

958
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:39,194
SO WHO KNOWS?

959
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:39,986
SO SHE'S FREAKING OUT.

960
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,155
SHE THINKS HE'S COMING AFTER

961
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,699
HER, AND HE'S TRYING TO TAKE

962
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:45,742
SABRINA AND CHRISTINA.

963
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:46,868
THEY STILL WANT TO TAKE YOU OUT

964
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,828
FIRST THEN HIM.

965
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,163
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO FROM

966
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:50,872
HERE.

967
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,040
I JUST KNOW THIS REALLY HELPS.

968
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,918
AND I-- I TRIED, LIKE, SO HARD,

969
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,170
I PUSHED FOR IT AS MUCH AS I

970
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,005
FELT I COULD PUSH FOR IT WITHOUT

971
00:29:59,088 --> 00:29:59,923
MAKING IT REALLY OBVIOUS.

972
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,758
YEAH, YEAH.

973
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:02,509
BUT THEN I START TO GET

974
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,260
NERVOUS BECAUSE I'M, LIKE, WHAT

975
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,553
IF THEY'RE PLAYING ME?

976
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,846
AND THEY DO VOTE ME BECAUSE

977
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,889
THAT'S WHAT HE'S GOING TO BE

978
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:08,598
SAYING.

979
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:12,268
AND I COULD GO HOME.

980
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,102
NOT IF YOU PLAY YOUR IDOL.

981
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:17,357
IT DEPENDS ON HOW I'M

982
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:17,899
FEELING.

983
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:18,608
I WOULD MAYBE RISK IT.

984
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,735
THAT'S HOW SURE I FEEL THEY WANT

985
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:24,280
TO TAKE HIM OUT RIGHT NOW.

986
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,323
OH, MY GOD.

987
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,616
I'M SORRY.

988
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:31,663
I KNOW THAT'S REALLY STRESSFUL.

989
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,414
IF ALICIA DOESN'T VOTE OUT

990
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,791
TARZAN, I WILL PROBABLY VOTE

991
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,960
WITH ALICIA, CHRISTINA AND

992
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,587
TARZAN TO TAKE CHELSEA OUT.

993
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,089
MY STRUGGLE TO KEEP CHELS IN
THIS

994
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:44,050
GAME AND USE AN IDOL THAT TAKES

995
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:44,968
ME TO THE FINAL FOUR NO MATTER

996
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,845
WHAT SEEMS LIKE AN UNWISE

997
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:48,555
DECISION TO PUT EVERYTHING ON

998
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,974
THE LINE FOR CHELSEA AND SABRINA

999
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,141
WITH SIX PEOPLE LEFT IN THE GAME

1000
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:52,809
WHEN I KNOW FOR A FACT I COULD
SIT AT THE FINAL FOUR.

1001
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,061
DO YOU KNOW WHAT INFURIATES

1002
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:55,353
ME?

1003
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:56,020
WHAT.

1004
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,272
DO YOU KNOW WHAT INFURIATES

1005
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:57,564
ME?

1006
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,441
WHAT.

1007
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,069
PEOPLE LIKE THAT, THAT ARE

1008
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:04,112
GOING TO BE HERE LONGER THAN ME.

1009
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,113
WHAT?

1010
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,656
NO, NO, NO.

1011
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,449
HUH?

1012
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,659
YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO THE

1013
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:10,410
END.

1014
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,953
IT'S NOT THE END OF THE ROAD AT

1015
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:12,287
ALL.

1016
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,121
( SIGHS )

1017
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,956
THAT'S JUST WHAT BOTHERS ME.

1018
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,792
LIKE, IF I WERE TO GO HOME

1019
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:24,173
TOMORROW KNOWING CHRISTINA'S

1020
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,466
HERE, AFTER 35 DAYS.

1021
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,175
DON'T THINK LIKE THAT.

1022
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,927
I SHOULDN'T THINK LIKE THAT.

1023
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,138
YOU KNOW HOW THIS GAME CAN

1024
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,182
QUICKLY CHANGE.

1025
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,185
LET'S JUST TAKE IT OUR BY OUR.

1026
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,688
NOT EVEN FREAKING DAY BY DAY

1027
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:39,814
NOW, HOUR BY HOUR.

1028
00:31:39,897 --> 00:31:43,526
THIS PLAN TONIGHT HINGES ON

1029
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,236
PRETTY MUCH TWO PEOPLE TO SWAY

1030
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,154
THE VOTES.

1031
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,030
KIM TO SWAY ALICIA'S MIND TO SAY

1032
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,239
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER AND

1033
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:52,160
WE WANT THAT SUCKER TARZAN GONE.

1034
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:55,330
HE IS OUT TO GET YOU.

1035
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,206
AND IT ALL HINGES ON ALICIA

1036
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,124
BELIEVING EVERY MORSAL OF WHAT

1037
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,834
COMES OUT OF KIM'S MOUTH.

1038
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:01,210
KIM, SHE BATS HER BABY BLUE EYES

1039
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,671
AND LOOKS RIGHT DEAD AT YOU, AND

1040
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,840
IT'S REALLY HARD NOT TO BELIEVE

1041
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:06,507
KIM.

1042
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,634
SEE, I'M STILL WALKING WITH

1043
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,177
YOU, EVEN THOUGH MY FOOT IS

1044
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,678
MESSED UP.

1045
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,847
BUT I SENSE-- I SENSE YOU

1046
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:13,848
DON'T WANT ME TO GO DOWN TO THE

1047
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:14,849
TOP THREE.

1048
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:15,683
NO!

1049
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,143
YOU SURE?

1050
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,145
I FEEL THAT--

1051
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,188
I MEAN, YOU CAN TELL ME THE

1052
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,522
TRUTH.

1053
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,106
LISTEN--

1054
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,524
NO, FILE WE NEED TO TAKE

1055
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,025
OUT-- OW!

1056
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:24,692
CHELSEA TODAY.

1057
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,069
YES, IS KIM STILL ON BOARD

1058
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,570
WITH THAT?

1059
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:28,196
YES, I TALKED TO HER.

1060
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:28,738
WE'RE ALL GOOD.

1061
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:31,157
I'VE BEEN AWARE THAT THE

1062
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,993
GIRLS NEEDED ME TO HELP THEM GET
RID OF THE BOYS.

1063
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:34,535
WELL, I DID THAT.

1064
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,537
I ACTUALLY DID THAT.

1065
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,581
I HELP THEM GET RID OF FIVE

1066
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,332
BOYS.

1067
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,208
AND NOW IF I HAVEN'T SCREWED IT

1068
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,044
UP BY BEING IRASCIBLE THE LAST

1069
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:46,089
COUPLE OF DAYS, I HOPE THE GIRLS

1070
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,549
DON'T JUMP ON ME TONIGHT BUT

1071
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,218
ACTUALLY KNOCK OUT CHELSEA.

1072
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,344
IF IT'S YOU, ME, AND CHRISTINA,

1073
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:52,720
I THINK YOU'VE GOT IT NAILED.

1074
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,222
IF ALICIA WOULD THINK IT THROUGH

1075
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,181
A LITTLE BIT BETTER SHE'D SEE

1076
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:57,517
WHY THAT WOULD BE BETTER FOR

1077
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,226
HER.

1078
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,352
EXCEPT THEY KNOW THERE'S NO WAY

1079
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,104
FOR HER TO REALLY TRUST ME, AND

1080
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,231
SO SHE COULD BE INFLUENCED BY

1081
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:03,898
KIM.

1082
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:07,110
HOW ABOUT IF WE END UP TAKING

1083
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:07,694
KIM?

1084
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:12,240
IF YOU TAKE KIM, I THINK

1085
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,783
YOU'RE BEST BET AT WINNING, IF

1086
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:14,492
YOU TAKE CHRISTINA.

1087
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:21,040
I THINK KIM-- KIM'S, HER ANGELIC

1088
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,542
FACE HER BLUE EYES, SHE MIGHT

1089
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:23,584
TWIN AFTER ALL, AND THAT'S NOT

1090
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:24,877
FAIR TO YOU.

1091
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,130
KIM, WITH HER ANGELICKIZE,

1092
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:31,759
ACTUALLY FOOLED TROYZAN AND

1093
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,219
JAY-BIRD, SO GOOD KNOWS, SHE

1094
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:34,554
COULD PROBABLY FOOL ALICIA.

1095
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:35,805
HERE WE GO!

1096
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:36,806
PUT IT ON.

1097
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,767
I BET $5?

1098
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,103
O-M-G.

1099
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,396
THIS ISN'T OFFENSIVE TO

1100
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,272
ANYBODY IF I WORE THIS?

1101
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,774
THAT TANK TOP HAS DRIED BLOOD

1102
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,233
ON IT.

1103
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,444
ALL RIGHT.

1104
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,280
I WOULDN'T WANT WOMEN'S DIRTY

1105
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,990
PANTIES TOUCHING THE SKIN ON MY

1106
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:54,615
FOREHEAD.

1107
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,992
I DON'T WANT TO BLINDSIDE

1108
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:56,701
TARZAN TONIGHT.

1109
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:59,078
WE HAVE A FATHER-DAUGHTER-LIKE

1110
00:33:59,162 --> 00:33:59,787
RELATIONSHIP.

1111
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,122
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, HE MIGHT

1112
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,166
REUNITE WITH SABRINA AND TAKE

1113
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,584
CHRISTINE AND PERSUADE HER.

1114
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,002
AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT I WANT

1115
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:06,627
TO AVOID.

1116
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,338
PLEASE, PLEASE, HOLD THE

1117
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:09,797
APPLAUSE.

1118
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,924
NO, NO, NO, NO.

1119
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:12,467
PLEASE.

1120
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:17,263
THIS IS KILLING ME.

1121
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:19,849
I WANT TO SAY I TRUST KIM.

1122
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,434
I WANT TO SAY 100%, BUT THERE

1123
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:25,271
IS, LIKE, THIS DOUBT IN MY MIND

1124
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,314
THAT MAYBE SHE'S PLAYING ME.

1125
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,692
SO IT'S, LIKE, I DON'T KNOW.

1126
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:30,276
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE DO

1127
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,361
I GO WITH?

1128
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,964
Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

1129
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,424
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1130
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,300
OH, BOY.

1131
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:58,387
Jeff: JONAS, MICHAEL, JAY,

1132
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:01,390
LEIF, TROYZAN, AND KAT, VOTED

1133
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:08,356
OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1134
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,358
SO, SABRINA, HERE WE ARE, DOWN

1135
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,276
TO A HAND FULL, AND ARE YOU

1136
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,863
STILL HERE.

1137
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:16,322
SURPRISE YOU?

1138
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,698
NO, NOT REALLY.

1139
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,200
YOU KNOW, IF YOU DON'T PUT

1140
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,868
YOURSELF IN THE MIX, THEN, YOU

1141
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:21,410
KNOW, YOU'VE ALREADY DEFEATED

1142
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,037
YOURSELF FROM THE START.

1143
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,705
SO OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO INCLUDE

1144
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,373
YOURSELF.

1145
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:25,665
Jeff: STILL BELIEVE YOU CAN

1146
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:25,957
WIN?

1147
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,250
WHY NOT?

1148
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:27,875
YEAH.

1149
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,378
Jeff: TARZAN, YOU'RE STILL

1150
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,045
HERE.

1151
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:32,213
ONLY BY THE GRACE OF GOD I'M

1152
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,216
STILL HERE.

1153
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,552
Jeff: WHY DO YOU THINK YOU

1154
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,387
ARE STILL HERE WHEN ALL THE

1155
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,555
OTHER GUYS ARE OVER ON THE JURY?

1156
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:44,058
BECAUSE I HELPED THE LADIES

1157
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:45,393
GET RID OF THE GUYS.

1158
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,227
Jeff: BUT THAT MOMENT HAS

1159
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,186
COME AND GONE.

1160
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,938
AND MY MOMENT'S PROBABLY JUST

1161
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:49,647
ABOUT OVER.

1162
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,398
BUT, YOU KNOW, IF SOMEBODY WANTS

1163
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,025
TO TAKE ME TO THE END, I'LL GO.

1164
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,402
I'M NOT STUPID.

1165
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,572
BUT IT WOULDN'T BE A BAD TACTIC

1166
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,614
BECAUSE THESE FIVE GUYS ARE

1167
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,366
GOING TO VOTE FOR WHAT, A

1168
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:00,825
MILLIONAIRE?

1169
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:01,826
I DON'T THINK SO.

1170
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,703
Jeff: SO, SABRINA, SOMEBODY

1171
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:04,954
WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE HE CAN WIN

1172
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,706
AND NO ONE ELSE SEEMS TO BELIEVE

1173
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,708
HE CAN WIN COULD BECOME AN

1174
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,375
ASSET.

1175
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,252
TO A DEGREE, BUT AT THE END

1176
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,628
OF THE DAY, WE'RE WOMEN AND HE'S

1177
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,381
STILL A MAN, AND NO MATTER WHO

1178
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,383
HE HELPED PICK OFF THERE MAY BE

1179
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,467
SOME PEOPLE ON THE JURY WHO ARE

1180
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,719
LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT?

1181
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:20,303
I DON'T WANT A WOMAN TO WIN AT

1182
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:21,012
ALL.

1183
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,973
IT'S A RISK, I THINK, TO TAKE

1184
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:24,807
HIM TO THE TOP.

1185
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,392
Jeff: TARZAN, REALLY,

1186
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:26,684
THERE'S VERY LITTLE ROOM TO

1187
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:27,351
HIDE.

1188
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,478
I THINK OUR GAME IS SOLID AT

1189
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,229
THE MOMENT.

1190
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,273
I MEAN, THEY'VE KEPT THEIR WORD

1191
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,067
AND ALMOST INVARIABLY THE RIGHT

1192
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,611
PERSON GOES EACH TIME.

1193
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,112
Jeff: TARZAN, DO YOU THINK

1194
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:38,988
THE JURY WOULD AGREE?

1195
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,740
NO, IT'S HUMAN NATURE WHEN

1196
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,783
YOU'RE VOTED OUT, YOU'RE NOT

1197
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:43,451
INTROSPECTIVE ENOUGH TO SAY,

1198
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,118
"WAIT A MINUTE.

1199
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:45,995
THE PERSON THAT'S VOTED OUT

1200
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,122
ISN'T IN THE ALIGNMENT WHEN THE

1201
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:52,460
GAME IS-- EXCUSE ME-- AFOOT."

1202
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,755
Jeff: BUT THEY BELIEVE THEY

1203
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:56,339
WERE.

1204
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:57,131
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT POINT.

1205
00:36:57,214 --> 00:36:59,675
Jeff: TARZAN, DO YOU OFTEN

1206
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,635
FEEL MISUNDERSTOOD IN THIS GAME?

1207
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,470
I WOULD SAY THAT'S TRUE,

1208
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,012
YEAH.

1209
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,222
IT'S LIKE THE DAY I WORE

1210
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,766
SOMETHING AND THEY'RE WORRIED

1211
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:07,683
ABOUT MIGROAB CROEBS AND THEY

1212
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:08,976
HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I KNOW ABOUT

1213
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,770
THAT AND THAT'S WHY I WASN'T

1214
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:11,687
WORRY BUT THEY WERE.

1215
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:12,521
Jeff: WHAT DID YOU WEAR?

1216
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,523
HE'S WEARING KAT'S TANK.

1217
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,692
I'M WEARING THIS, BUT I ALSO

1218
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,527
PUT HER PANTIES ON MY HEAD, AND

1219
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:22,156
THEY WERE LIKE, "OH, NO!

1220
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:22,657
PANTY!

1221
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,824
"JUST FOR A JOKE.

1222
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,660
AND I'M NOT AFRAID OF THOSE

1223
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,953
PANTIES AT ALL.

1224
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,621
Jeff: SABRINA, THIS REALLY

1225
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,707
IS, ON A VERY BASE LEVEL WHAT

1226
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:32,625
"SURVIVOR" IS ABOUT.

1227
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:33,334
YOU HAVE TO DECIDE, TARZAN WANTS

1228
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,587
TO PUT ON KAT'S SHIRT, HE THINKS

1229
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:37,213
IT'S FUNNY.
HE STILL MIGHT BE THE GUY I TAKE
TO THE END.

1230
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,714
THOSE ARE THE DECISION YOU

1231
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,382
WEIGH.

1232
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,217
AND WHAT I'VE BEEN WEIGHING

1233
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,094
IS COULD THIS BRILLIANT MAN WHO

1234
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:46,013
IS WEARING PANTIES ON HIS HEAD

1235
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,515
BE PLAYING US.

1236
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,685
OH, I JUST WANTED TO SEE MY

1237
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,352
WEAPON WIFE.

1238
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,728
I JUST WANT THE THE ADVENTURE.

1239
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,397
AND NOW YOU WANT TO PLAY THE

1240
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:54,981
GAME... YEAH.

1241
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,691
Jeff: ALICIA WHAT THE

1242
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:57,400
REACTION BACK TO CAMP WHEN

1243
00:37:57,483 --> 00:38:00,069
SABRINA AND KIM WERE ASKED TO GO

1244
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,028
WITH CHELSO THE AWARD.

1245
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,738
SHE PICKED SABRINA, WHO I

1246
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,157
THOUGHT WAS A FAIR CHOICE,

1247
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:05,866
DEFINITELY.

1248
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,159
HOWEVER, WAS KIM A FAIR CHOICE,

1249
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,078
WHEN THESE TWO HAVE NOT BEEN ON

1250
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:09,787
ANY REWARDS IN A WHILE?

1251
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,373
I MEAN, THAT'S KIND OF UP TO THE

1252
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,416
PERSON WHO IS PICKING.

1253
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:15,418
KAT PICKED TWO PEOPLE THAT SHE

1254
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:16,002
LIKED --

1255
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:16,711
AND SHE WAS VOTED OUT.

1256
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:20,214
RIGHT.

1257
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:21,507
Jeff: KRISTINA, FRUSTRATED

1258
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,758
THAT CHELSEA DIDN'T PICK YOU?

1259
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,218
YEAH, THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT

1260
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:25,886
OF FRUSTRATION AND STUFF.

1261
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,263
THERE WAS A CONVERSATION BETWEEN

1262
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,223
CHELS AND I, AND WE MADE AN

1263
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:30,474
AGREEMENT THAT, LIKE, WE WOULD

1264
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,058
TAKE EACH OTHER.

1265
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,977
SO I WAS A LITTLE BIT

1266
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:33,394
DISAPPOINTED.

1267
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,020
BUT --

1268
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,021
SO YOU FEEL LIKE SHE BROKE

1269
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:35,896
HER WORD TO YOU.

1270
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,232
YES, I DID.

1271
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:40,359
SHE ALSO BROKE HER WORD TO ME

1272
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,068
RIGHT AFTER THAT CONVERSATION

1273
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:46,907
WHICH IS WHY I DIDN'T TAKE HER.

1274
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,284
Jeff: SO WHAT WILL SAVE YOU

1275
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:48,951
TONIGHT?

1276
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:49,702
I THINK PEOPLE ARE STARTING

1277
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:52,246
TO GET A BIGGER FEEL FOR TARZAN

1278
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:54,248
AND WHAT HE REALLY MIGHT BE

1279
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:54,915
DOING IN THIS GAME.

1280
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,625
I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST AN

1281
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,085
ADVENTURE FOR HIM.

1282
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,420
I THINK HE MIGHT BE PLAYING SOME

1283
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,839
PEOPLE MORE THAN THEY THINK.

1284
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:02,423
JEFF, I'M NOT PLAYING

1285
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:03,090
ANYBODY.

1286
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,592
AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY

1287
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,720
ABOUT IT.

1288
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,096
Jeff: ON THAT NOTE, LET'S

1289
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,389
GET TO THE VOTE.

1290
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,265
CANNOT VOTE FOR ALICIA.

1291
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:12,266
SHE HAS IMMUNITY.

1292
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:13,434
EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.

1293
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,394
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1294
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:24,445
TARZAN, YOU'RE UP.

1295
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:31,535
TARZAN, YOU'RE UP.

1296
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,789
TARZAN, PLEASE GET THE HELL

1297
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:35,915
OFF THIS ISLAND BEFORE YOU DRIVE

1298
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:38,000
ME CRAZY.

1299
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,976
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1300
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:04,443
VOTES.
