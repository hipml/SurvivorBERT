1
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,293
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR":

2
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:06,548
>> OMETEPE SHALL LIVE LONG
IN "SURVIVOR" LORE,

3
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:08,466
AS LONG AS WE STICK TOGETHER.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,094
>> Jeff: SINCE THE MERGE,
THE FORMER OMETEPE TRIBE

5
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,971
HAS BEEN UNSTOPPABLE.

6
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:15,098
>> WE'RE GUARANTEED TO GO
TO THE FINAL SIX.

7
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,766
>> WE HAVE THE NUMBERS,

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,060
SO IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE
TO TAKE OUT

9
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,103
THE ZAPATERA PEOPLE
ONE BY ONE BY ONE.

10
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,772
>> Jeff: THEY'VE WON
CHALLENGE AFTER CHALLENGE.

11
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,274
GRANT WINS IMMUNITY!

12
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,942
ANDREA WINS.

13
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:27,277
ROB WINS IMMUNITY!

14
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,780
AND WHITTLED THE FORMER
ZAPATERA TRIBE DOWN TO TWO.

15
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,449
>> HO, HO, HO.

16
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,118
>> Jeff: THE ONLY CRACK
IN THEIR ALLIANCE APPEARED

17
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,579
WHEN PHILLIP'S ANTICS
GOT TO BE TOO MUCH.

18
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:38,955
>> EVERY TIME I MAKE AN ARGUMENT

19
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:42,167
WITH ONE OF THOSE GUYS
I'M ( BLEEP ) CRAZY.

20
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,376
>> HE JUST BROUGHT IN
THE RACE CARD.

21
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,963
>> Jeff: ANDREA ALSO CAME
UNDER FIRE WHEN SHE CONTINUED

22
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,840
TO SHOW AN ATTACHMENT TO MATT.

23
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,800
>> ANDREA STILL HAS A SOFT SPOT
FOR MATT

24
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,595
SO IT JUST MAKES SENSE
TO GET HER OUT.

25
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:56,097
>> Jeff: BUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL,

26
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:59,267
THEY TOOK OUT RALPH,
AND IN A SECOND, SURPRISE VOTE,

27
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,270
THE OMETEPE SIX DID WHAT
FEW ALLIANCES HAVE DONE BEFORE--

28
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:05,857
STEVE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN--
STICK TOGETHER

29
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,319
FROM THE BEGINNING
AND DECIMATE AN ENTIRE TRIBE.

30
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,489
NOW THEY FACE THEIR MOST
FEARSOME ENEMY YET--

31
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,533
EACH OTHER-- AND STEVE AND RALPH
HEAD TO REDEMPTION ISLAND

32
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,243
WHERE THEY WILL FACE
MIKE AND MATT

33
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,330
IN THE FIRST-EVER FOUR-WAY DUEL.

34
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,799
>> HEY, GUYS.

35
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,342
>> RALPH!

36
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,635
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY?
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

37
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:34,636
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

38
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,637
>> THERE HE IS.

39
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,639
HOW ARE YOU, MAN?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

40
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,265
>> WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON?
>> WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON?

41
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,643
ME AND STEVE FIGHTING WITH

42
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:45,480
PHILLIP FOR A LITTLE RICE
AND ALL THAT GOOD STUFF.

43
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,232
I BET YOU STEVE LOST 40 POUNDS.

44
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,692
>> PROBABLY.

45
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,402
>> I MEAN, HE'S PITIFUL.

46
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,029
HE DIDN'T THINK HE WAS
GOING TO MAKE IT

47
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:54,823
BACK TO CAMP TODAY
AFTER THE GAME.

48
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:55,990
>> WOW.

49
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:56,282
>> I DON'T KNOW.

50
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,200
>> HEY.

51
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,243
>> YEAH.

52
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,370
>> YOU GUYS GOT ROOM
FOR ONE MORE?

53
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,038
>> STEVE!
>> STEVE!

54
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:03,998
>> WHAT UP, BROTHER!

55
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,625
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

56
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,251
>> WE WERE JUST TALKING
ABOUT YOU.

57
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,378
( LAUGHTER )

58
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,714
>> I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
REDEMPTION ISLAND

59
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,424
KEEPS ON GETTING
CRAZIER AND CRAZIER.

60
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,552
>> LORDY ME!

61
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,719
>> WE'VE GOT THE THREE REMAINING

62
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,388
ZAPATERA HERE
AT REDEMPTION ISLAND.

63
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,973
AND MATT.

64
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,057
>> I'VE MISSED YOU, MAN.

65
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,268
>> IT'S JUST SO NICE TO SEE
THREE OF THE REALLY

66
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:28,064
FRIENDLY FACES COMPARED
TO THE OMETEPE TRIBE.

67
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:31,234
I JUST DID NOT WANT TO GO
BACK THERE TONIGHT.

68
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,194
>> SIX OMETEPE LEFT.

69
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,404
>> WOW.

70
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,905
>> WHAT ARE THEY
GOING TO DO NOW?

71
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,324
>> THE JURY IS GOING TO BE
ALL ZAPATERA.

72
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,450
>> ALL ZAPATERA.

73
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,078
>> JULIE, DAVID, MYSELF,

74
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:43,413
MATT, RALPH, STEVE.

75
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,874
THAT'S SIX RIGHT THERE.

76
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:46,541
>> YEAH, YEAH.

77
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:49,085
>> I SEE DAYLIGHT AHEAD NOW.

78
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:52,589
IF ONE OF US ZAPATERA GUYS
GETS INTO THE TOP THREE,

79
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,257
WE'VE GOT THIS THING WON.

80
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,259
AND I WANT TO BE THAT GUY.

81
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,721
SO I'M GOING TO GIVE IT
ALL I'VE GOT.

82
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,435
>> YEAH, YEAH!

83
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,979
>> WHOOO!

84
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,273
>> TRIBAL COUNCIL
WAS PRETTY MUCH AMAZING

85
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,483
BECAUSE IN ONE TRIBAL COUNCIL,
WE GOT RID

86
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,777
OF THE REMAINING TWO ZAPATERA
TRIBE MEMBERS

87
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,488
SO NOW IT'S JUST
THE OMETEPE SIX.

88
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,866
>> OMETEPE!

89
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,534
>> IT IS A LITTLE SCARY THAT NOW

90
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,286
WE HAVE TO TAKE OUT
ONE OF OUR OWN,

91
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,787
BUT IT'S ALSO A LITTLE
EXCITING

92
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,915
BECAUSE FOR THE LAST,
WHAT, FIVE VOTES

93
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,459
WE'VE BEEN ON CRUISE CONTROL
SO NOW WE CAN ACTUALLY

94
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:33,212
GET INTO THE GAME
OF WHICH I'M EXCITED.

95
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,798
>> HEY, NAT, YOU OKAY?

96
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,925
>> YEAH.

97
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,177
>> IS IT HAPPY TEARS OR SAD?

98
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,470
>> I DON'T KNOW.

99
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:45,475
IT'S HORMONE TEARS.

100
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,435
>> I'M SORRY.

101
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,647
>> I THINK I STARTED GETTING
KIND OF EMOTIONAL

102
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,150
JUST BECAUSE NOW WE
HAVE TO START

103
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,985
KNOCKING EVERYBODY OFF,

104
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,488
AND FROM THERE, IT JUST,
LIKE, STARTED THINKING

105
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,490
ABOUT HOME
AND MISSING MY FAMILY,

106
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,494
MISSING MY FRIENDS,
MISSING REGULAR LIFE.

107
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,996
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK
I'M CRYING BECAUSE I'M--

108
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,832
LIKE I DON'T WANT
TO BE HERE OR ANYTHING.

109
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,834
IT JUST HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH--

110
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,169
>> YOU'RE JUST HAVING A MOMENT?

111
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:14,170
>> YEAH.

112
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:15,171
>> IT'S OKAY.

113
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:16,172
>> YEAH.

114
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,299
>> THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES
OUT HERE WHERE NATALIE

115
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,342
HAS JUST BEEN MATURE
BEYOND HER YEARS

116
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,053
AND THEN THERE HAVE BEEN
OTHER TIMES WHEN,

117
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,973
YOU KNOW,
HER YOUTH JUST SHOWS THROUGH.

118
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,641
SHE'S 19.

119
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,851
YOU KNOW, BEING OUT HERE
FOR 30 DAYS,

120
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,520
IT TAKES ITS TOLL ON YOU.

121
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,231
AND IT'S CRITICAL FOR ME
TO COMFORT HER.

122
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:36,192
I MEAN, SHE'S MY MAIN ALLIANCE
IN THIS GAME,

123
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:38,569
AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE
SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

124
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,197
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT YOU,
AND WE CARE ABOUT YOU,

125
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,615
AND, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE
SEE YOU ALL OF A SUDDEN

126
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,368
START TO CRY FOR NO REASON,
WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S WRONG.

127
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:49,247
I'VE GOT EIGHT DAYS LEFT,
EIGHT DAYS.

128
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,374
I'VE JUST GOT TO KEEP
EVERYBODY HAPPY,

129
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,584
AND AS LONG AS THEY DON'T
START TALKING TO EACH OTHER

130
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,629
AND REALIZE THAT I'M THE ONE
THAT SHOULD BE GOING,

131
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,757
I'LL BE ALL SE SET.

132
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,204
>> TREE MAIL!

133
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,917
SPRINT OPEN FIRST.

134
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,502
>> OH, MY GOD!

135
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,254
IS THIS FAMILY?

136
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:42,550
>> WE GOT TREE MAIL THIS MORNING
AND WE GOT A BOX,

137
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,969
AND ON THE TOP OF THE BOX
IT SAID "SPRINT.

138
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,179
>> OH, MY GOD.

139
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,638
YOU'VE GOT TO BE JOKING ME
RIGHT NOW.

140
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,683
>> CELL PHONES, BABY!

141
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,811
>> "ANOTHER GOT VOTED OUT

142
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,772
BUT ARE THEY OUT FOR SURE?

143
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,315
COME TO THE ARENA AND SEE

144
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,608
WHO WILL LEAVE
AND WHO WILL ENDURE.

145
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,486
FIRST, CHECK VIDEOS
FOR A SURPRISE."

146
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,487
>> YEAH!

147
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,572
>> NO!

148
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:05,907
>> OH, MY GOD!

149
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,533
>> WE GOT, LIKE, A MESSAGE
ABOUT THE DUEL

150
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,285
WHICH WE KIND OF DISCARDED

151
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:10,620
BECAUSE THEN IT SAID,
"CHECK VIDEOS."

152
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,414
>> EVERYBODY BE QUIET.

153
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,875
>> HI, I'M TRACY, NATALIE'S MOM.

154
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,422
IT'S HARD THAT YOU'VE BEEN
GONE SO LONG,

155
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:25,259
AND I'M SO PROUD OF YOU
THAT YOU STUCK THIS OUT,

156
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,846
AND WE ALL MISS YOU.

157
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,598
DADDY'S VERY PROUD OF YOU.

158
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,476
I HOPE THAT YOU ARE STRONG.

159
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,812
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU.

160
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,647
I LOVE YOU.

161
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,483
>> NATALIE WAS A LITTLE
UPSET, YOU KNOW,

162
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,985
AFTER WE GOT OUT OF TRIBAL.

163
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,321
AND IT WAS PERFECT TIMING
FOR HER

164
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,448
AND REALLY FOR ALL OF US.

165
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,658
>> MY DADDY!

166
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,451
>> HI, ANDREA, WE ALL MISS YOU.

167
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,454
YOUR SISTERS CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

168
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,331
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN GONE
SO LONG.

169
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:56,624
WE'LL SEE YOU SOON.

170
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:57,667
>> OH!

171
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,168
>> BEAUTIFUL!

172
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,670
>> I'M TRACY, PHILLIP'S SISTER.

173
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,674
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU
HOW PROFOUNDLY I MISS YOU.

174
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,051
WE ARE ALL THINKING ABOUT YOU.

175
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,220
WE'RE ON YOUR SIDE.

176
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:09,804
>> HEY, ROB.

177
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,806
WE ARE SO PROUD OF YOU.

178
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,307
YOU HAVE MADE IT SO FAR.

179
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,017
MOM AND DAD SEND THEIR LOVE.

180
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,477
STAY STRONG.

181
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,687
YOU'VE DONE A GREAT JOB.

182
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,856
WE'RE SO PROUD OF YOU.

183
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,400
>> GRANT.

184
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,776
>> THAT'S MY SISTER'S HUSBAND.

185
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,488
>> YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT ADRIEN,

186
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,073
SHE IS NEWLY PREGNANT.

187
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:29,782
GOOD LUCK.

188
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,617
WIN THIS GAME, AND COME HOME.

189
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,038
>> HEY, ASHLEY!

190
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,373
OH, MY GOSH.

191
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:38,916
WE ALL MISS YOU SO MUCH, HONEY.

192
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,710
LOVE YOU AND COME HOME SAFE
TO US, SWEETHEART.

193
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,504
HANG IN THERE.

194
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:43,921
>> OH!

195
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,175
>> COME HERE!

196
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,511
>> IT'S DAY 31, AND, LIKE,
YOU FEEL EXHAUSTED,

197
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,180
BUT WHEN YOU HEAR FROM HOME,

198
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,223
IT JUST LIFTS
YOUR SPIRITS SO MUCH.

199
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:58,186
AND IT WAS A REALLY,
REALLY GOOD SURPRISE.

200
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,859
>> SPRINT 4G,
FOLLOW THE PATH TO THE ARENA

201
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,944
WHERE YOU WILL COMPETE
IN A DUEL.

202
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,405
CHECK VIDEOS FOR A SURPRISE.

203
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:10,406
>> OH, MY GOODNESS!

204
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:11,490
THE VIDEOS!

205
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,911
TREE MAIL TODAY, I THOUGHT IT
WAS JUST GOING TO BE

206
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,455
WALK OUT THERE,
MAYBE GET A NOTE TO A DUEL.

207
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,623
BUT OH!

208
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,790
WE'RE GOING TO GET TO SEE VIDEOS
OF OUR LOVED ONES.

209
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,418
>> ALL RIGHT.

210
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:22,960
>> HEY, RALPH.

211
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,046
HAVING A GOOD TIME?

212
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,756
I WANT YOU TO KNOW WE ALL
MISS YOU HERE AT HOME.

213
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,383
ALL THE COWS ARE DOING GREAT.

214
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,469
A COUPLE OF THE CHICKENS
GOT KILLED, THOUGH.

215
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,263
HOPE YOU'RE NOT UPSET
ABOUT THAT.

216
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,390
WE'RE REALLY PROUD OF YOU.

217
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,059
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU BACK HOME.

218
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,603
>> THAT'S AWESOME!

219
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:44,899
>> WE ALL MISS YOU
AND HOPE THAT YOU ARE--

220
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,901
YOU ARE WELL,
AND YOU ARE SAFE.

221
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,778
>> I'VE NEVER GONE FOR 31 DAYS

222
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,614
WITHOUT BEING ABLE
TO SPEAK TO ANY OF MY FAMILY,

223
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,782
EVEN WHEN I WAS IN
THE MARINE CORPS.

224
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,618
WE COULD STILL REACH OUT
VIA E-MAIL.

225
00:08:55,701 --> 00:09:00,122
SO IT WAS REALLY TOUCHING
TO SEE A MESSAGE FROM MY MOM.

226
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,124
LOVE YOU, MOM.

227
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,460
>> HEY, BROTHER,
JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW

228
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:07,255
THAT THE FOLKS ARE WISHING
ALL THE LOVE FOR YOU.

229
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,673
WE'RE THINKING A LOT ABOUT YOU.

230
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,800
I'M GOING TO GET EMOTIONAL HERE.

231
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,428
A BIG STEAK AND COLD BEERS
ARE ON ME

232
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,472
NEXT TIME WE SEE EACH OTHER.

233
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:17,598
>> THAT'S AWESOME.

234
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,766
>> HEY, MATT.

235
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:22,019
I JUST WANT TO SAY LOVE YOU.

236
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,146
I HOPE YOU'RE HEALTHY.

237
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,147
I HOPE YOU'RE STAYING STRONG.

238
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,442
>> I JUST SEE MY BROTHER
AND I'M JUST THINKING--

239
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,612
I JUST WANT TO DIE RIGHT THERE,
JUST SEEING HIM.

240
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,489
>> WE ALL LOVE YOU
AND MISS YOU LIKE CRAZY.

241
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:34,991
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU VERY SOON.

242
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,285
>> IT MAKES EVERY STRUGGLE,
EVERY HARD TIME

243
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,120
I'VE GONE THROUGH
ON REDEMPTION ISLAND

244
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:39,829
COMPLETELY WORTH IT.

245
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,706
>> THREE, TWO...

246
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,208
THAT'S IT.

247
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,710
IF THERE'S A CHANCE
THAT I CAN SPEND

248
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,169
ANY TIME WITH ME BROTHER,

249
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,423
I WILL DO ANYTHING I CAN
TO WIN TODAY.

250
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,516
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

251
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:03,561
THE COMPETITORS
FOR TODAY'S DUEL.

252
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:08,482
MATT, MIKE, RALPH, AND STEVE.

253
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:12,069
GOOD MORNING.

254
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:12,945
>> GOOD MORNING.

255
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,239
>> Jeff: THIS MORNING
IN TREE MAIL,

256
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:19,160
BOTH CAMPS RECEIVED
THE EPIC 4G, ONLY FROM SPRINT.

257
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,746
I WILL TAKE THE PHONES BACK.

258
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,832
GRANT.

259
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:28,544
SO LOVE FROM HOME

260
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:30,546
ON A SPRINT PHONE
IS PRETTY NICE.

261
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:31,881
THAT'S WHAT WE LEARNED.

262
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,383
LOVE IN PERSON
WILL BE EVEN BETTER.

263
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,885
>> DON'T DO THIS.

264
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,471
>> Jeff: THE WINNER
OF TODAY'S DUEL

265
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,930
WILL GET THE OPPORTUNITY

266
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:43,392
TO SPEND SOME TIME
WITH THEIR LOVED ONE IN PERSON.

267
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,895
FIRST, YOU GOTTA WIN THE DUEL.

268
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,897
IT IS A FOUR-PERSON DUEL,

269
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,566
FIRST TIME WE'VE HAD
ONE OF THESE.

270
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:51,192
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

271
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,611
YOU EACH HAVE FOUR TILES.

272
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,946
EACH ROUND, YOU WILL TOSS A BALL

273
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,740
TRYING TO BREAK A TILE.

274
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:58,824
THE FIRST THREE PEOPLE TO BREAK

275
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,411
ALL THEIR TILES STAY ALIVE
IN THIS GAME.

276
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,121
THE LOSER IS OUT FOR GOOD,

277
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,248
THEIR QUEST FOR THE MONEY
IS OVER.

278
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,959
IN ADDITION, THE FIRST PERSON

279
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:13,297
TO FINISH THIS CHALLENGE
WINS LOVE FROM HOME.

280
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,091
( APPLAUSE )

281
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,259
THERE IS A LOT AT STAKE.

282
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,469
THIS IS IT.

283
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,762
ONE SHOT, TAKE YOUR SPOTS.

284
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,013
LET'S GO.

285
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,768
THE WAY THIS WILL WORK,
YOU'LL THROW,

286
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,604
ONE PERSON AT A TIME, IN ROUNDS.

287
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,022
MATT, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

288
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,613
MATT A LITTLE CHIP,
THAT WON'T DO IT.

289
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,240
MIKE.

290
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,370
MIKE ONE TOSS,
BREAKS HIS FIRST TILE.

291
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,708
RALPH MAKES A TOSS, VERY CLOSE.

292
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,130
STEVE SHORT.

293
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,799
AT THE END OF THE FIRST ROUND,
MIKE HAS ONE.

294
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,801
EVERYBODY ELSE NOTHING.

295
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,636
MATT, YOU'RE UP.

296
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,931

297
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:08,727

AT THE END OF THIS ROUND,
MIKE HAS TWO TILES BROKEN.

301
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,490
EVERYBODY ELSE HAS
ONE TILE BROKEN.

302
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,242
MATT, YOU'RE UP.

303
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,496
MATT BREAKS HIS SECOND TILE.

304
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,956
TYING HIM WITH MIKE.

305
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,003
MIKE BREAKS HIS THIRD TILE.

306
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:38,299
RALPH BREAKS HIS SECOND TILE.

307
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,176
STEVE JUST MISSES.

308
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,010
HERE'S WHERE WE STAND NOW.

309
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,846
MIKE HAS THREE TILES BROKEN.

310
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,514

313
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,484
OH!

314
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,693
JUST MISSES.

315
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:00,529
MIKE COULD WIN
THE DUEL RIGHT HERE.

316
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,700
AND HE DOES!

317
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:08,037
MIKE NOT ONLY STAYS ALIVE
IN THIS GAME

318
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,663
AND ON REDEMPTION ISLAND.

319
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,707
MIKE HAS JUST WON THE
OPPORTUNITY

320
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,753
FOR FOR SOME IN-PERSON,
UP-CLOSE LOVE FROM FAMILY.

321
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,214
IT IS NOW DOWN TO MATT,
RALPH, AND STEVE.

322
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,509
TWO MORE PEOPLE ARE GOING
TO STAY ALIVE IN THIS GAME.

323
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,552
ONE OF YOU WILL BE GOING HOME.

324
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,012
RALPH, YOU'RE UP.

325
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,390
JUST MISSES.

326
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,391
STEVE.

327
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:29,934
TAKE YOUR SHOT.

328
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,394
STEVE SHORT AGAIN.

329
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,063
MATT HAS TWO TILES BROKEN.

330
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,940
LOOKING FOR A THIRD.

331
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,567
AND HE GETS IT.

332
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,110
RALPH HAS TWO TILES BROKEN.

333
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,028
HE'S LOOKING FOR A THIRD.

334
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,573
AND HE GETS IT.

335
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,076
STEVE NEEDS TO GET
A SECOND ONE RIGHT HERE.

336
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,745
AND HE DOESN'T.

337
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:53,249
MATT AND RALPH BOTH ONLY HAVE
ONE TILE LEFT TO BREAK.

338
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,752
MATT STAYS ALIVE.

339
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,379
HE JOINS MIKE.

340
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,088
RALPH, BREAK THIS TILE.

341
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,549
YOU STAY ALIVE.

342
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,967
AND HE DOES.

343
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,094
RALPH WILL LIVE TO SEE
ANOTHER DAY

344
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,595
ON REDEMPTION ISLAND.

345
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,015
THE JOURNEY FOR STEVE
HAS COME TO AN END.

346
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,103
MIKE, FIRST OF ALL,
CONGRATULATIONS.

347
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,313
>> THANK YOU.

348
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,065
>> Jeff: SURVIVING ANOTHER
DUEL AND WINNING SOME LOVE.

349
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,943
STEVE, UNFORTUNATELY,
THE GAME IS OVER,

350
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,236
BUT YOU ARE NOT GOING HOME.

351
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,779
YOU ARE GOING TO BE
A MEMBER OF THE JURY.

352
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:24,280
TAKE YOUR BUFF.

353
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,114
PUT IT IN THE URN.

354
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,784
SEE YOU AT THE NEXT
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

355
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:30,661
>> THANKS, JEFF.

356
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,124
( APPLAUSE )

357
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,126
>> BYE, STEVE.

358
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,296
>> Jeff: NOW TO THE REWARD
PART OF THIS DUEL.

359
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,214
MIKE, COME ON OVER HERE.

360
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,636
SO AS PART OF WINNING THIS DUEL,
YOU HAVE WON

361
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,514
TIME WITH YOUR LOVED ONE,
YOUR MOM, JANE.

362
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,725
LET'S BRING HER OUT.

363
00:14:57,896 --> 00:14:58,814
HOW'S SHE LOOK?

364
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:00,649
>> AMAZING, AS ALWAYS.

365
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,153
>> Jeff: SO YOUR MOM
IS 10 FEET AWAY.

366
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,698
BUT BEFORE YOU GUYS EMBRACE,

367
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,325
YOU HAVE A DECISION TO MAKE.

368
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,493
IF YOU WANT, YOU CAN FORGO

369
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,954
YOUR OWN LOVE WITH YOUR MOM,

370
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,540
AND INSTEAD YOU COULD TRY TO BUY

371
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,876
SOME GOOD WILL
IN A JURY SITUATION

372
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,044
SHOULD YOU BE THE ONE
THAT REENTERS THE GAME

373
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:23,797
BY GIVING THE LOVE INSTEAD
TO THE TWO GUYS

374
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,592
YOU'VE BEEN LIVING WITH
OUT HERE ON REDEMPTION ISLAND.

375
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,887
>> WHAT'S UP!

376
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,889
>> Jeff: THERE'S MATT'S
BROTHER BURTON,

377
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:32,306
AND RALPH'S BUDDY, RONNIE.

378
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,182
( APPLAUSE )

379
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:37,394
>> RALPH.

380
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,355
>> Jeff: THAT'S YOUR
FIRST CHOICE.

381
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,150
YOUR SECOND CHOICE
IS YOU CAN INSTEAD GIVE LOVE

382
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,861
TO EVERYBODY LEFT IN THIS GAME.

383
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:47,196
>> OH!

384
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,990
>> THERE'S ANDREA'S DAD.

385
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,370
THERE'S GRANT'S BROTHER-IN-LAW.

386
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,954
STEVE.

387
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,917
THAT LOOKS LIKE ROB'S SISTER,
HEATHER.

388
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,252
THERE'S NATALIE'S MOM.

389
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,838
TRACY.

390
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:08,050
PHILLIP'S SISTER, TRACY.

391
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,678
AND ASHLEY'S MOM, TERRY.

392
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,098
SO, MIKE, VERY BIG

393
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:17,893
POTENTIALLY
MILLION-DOLLAR DECISION.

394
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:20,688
TAKE ME THROUGH
THE THOUGHT PROCESS.

395
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,065
>> THE DECISION
IS ALMOST CLEAR IN MY HEAD.

396
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,776
YESTERDAY, I WAS READING
IT WAS EITHER MATTHEW OR MARK,

397
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,946
AND JESUS WAS ASKED
OF ALL THE COMMANDMENTS,

398
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,572
WHAT ARE THE GREATEST?

399
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,282
AND HE RESPONDED,
"LOVE YOUR BROTHER

400
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,618
LIKE YOU WOULD LOVE YOURSELF."

401
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,913
SO I THINK IF I GIVE
THE MOST GOOD

402
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:40,249
TO THE MOST PEOPLE
AND MAKE FRIENDS FROM ENEMIES,

403
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:44,878
I THINK THAT'S
THE ONLY PLAY HERE.

404
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,589
>> Jeff: LET ME MAKE SURE
I'M CLEAR ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

405
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,258
YOU'RE GIVING UP YOUR LOVE
WITH YOUR MOM,

406
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,553
AND YOU'RE GIVING UP THE LOVE
FOR RALPH AND MATT,

407
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,930
AND YOU ARE GIVING IT
TO THE SIX PEOPLE

408
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:57,891
WHO SINGLEHANDEDLY
DECIMATED YOUR TRIBE.

409
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:58,892
>> YES.

410
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,269
>> Jeff: I GOTTA TELL YOU,
I THOUGHT THE ODDS

411
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:04,064
OF THAT HAPPENING
WERE LESS THAN ZERO.

412
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,734
JANE, DOES THIS DECISION
SURPRISE YOU?

413
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:07,901
>> NO.

414
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,445
THIS IS WHO MY SON IS.

415
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,612
HE IS A HERO.

416
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,781
HONEY, I'M SO VERY PROUD OF YOU.

417
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,032
>> SEE YOU SOON.

418
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,118
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, JANE,
BURTON, RONNIE,

419
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,619
TIME FOR YOU GUYS TO HEAD OUT.

420
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,787
>> MATT, STAY STRONG.

421
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,788
LOVE YOU.

422
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:20,789
>> I LOVE YOU, HONEY.

423
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:21,790
>> SEE YOU SOON.

424
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:22,791
>> OKAY.

425
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,126
>> BYE, YOU GUYS.

426
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,836
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SO,

427
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,671
YOU'VE MADE A HUGE DECISION
IN THE GAME.

428
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,464
I HOPE IT PAYS OFF FOR YOU.

429
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:32,926
MIKE, MATT, RALPH,
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

430
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,304
HEAD BACK AND AWAIT NEWS
OF YOUR NEXT DUEL.

431
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,348
>> THANK YOU, MIKE.
>> THANK YOU, MIKE.

432
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,349
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

433
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,476
DON'T VOTE ME OFF AGAIN.

434
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,519
( LAUGHTER )

435
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,230
>> Jeff: ONLY ONE THING
LEFT TO DO--

436
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,524
JOIN YOUR LOVED ONES.

437
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,358
YOU GUYS WILL HEAD BACK TO CAMP

438
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,403
AND SPEND THE AFTERNOON
TOGETHER.

439
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,482
>> TODAY I WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED

440
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,317
IF MIKE WOULD HAVE
KEPT HIS MOTHER

441
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,069
AND HUNG AROUND WITH HER
THE REST OF THE EVENING,

442
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,029
NO HARD FEELINGS WHATSOEVER.

443
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:36,907
BUT I'M SURE HE'S LOOKING
FOR WINNING A MILLION DOLLARS

444
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,700
AND WAS HOPING TO PULL IN
MORE VOTES,

445
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,203
SO HE LET FAMILY SEE THEM SIX

446
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,371
AND THAT REALLY PISSED ME OFF.

447
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,331
THAT WAS VERY HARD, MIKE.

448
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:47,876
YOU HAVE THE OLD FEATHER
IN THE GAME.

449
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,211
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

450
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,420
>> IT'S NOT.

451
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,422
>> IT SUCKED.

452
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,883
>> I THINK IT WAS
KIND OF STUPID,

453
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,552
HIM AND THE GOOD LORD,
WHATEVER.

454
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,387
HE SAID THAT'S THE WAY
HE WANTED TO DO IT.

455
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,347
THAT'S SOMETHING
HE HAS TO LIVE WITH.

456
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,224
BUT IF I HAD BEEN IN HIS SHOES,

457
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,517
I WOULD HAVE SPENT IT
WITH MY MOM.

458
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,477
>> MIKE, I'M GLAD I DIDN'T WIN

459
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,395
BECAUSE I COULDN'T
HAVE DONE THAT.

460
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,355
I MEAN--

461
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,065
>> THE WAY THEY TREATED ME--

462
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:12,025
>> YEAH, I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,
ME, TOO.

463
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,402
>> I WOULDN'T HAVE
GIVEN IT TO THEM.

464
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,029
>> I ASKED GOD TO HELP ME WIN

465
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:19,116
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT
HE ASKED OF ME.

466
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,451
THE DECISION I MADE TODAY
WAS NOT A STRATEGIC ONE.

467
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,121
IT WASN'T TO EARN
THE GOOD GRACES

468
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,038
OF THE OMETEPE TRIBE.

469
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,582
IT WAS JUST
THE RIGHT DECISION TO MAKE

470
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,916
AND THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

471
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,501
IF I MAKE IT DEEP INTO THIS GAME

472
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:33,547
AND IT EARNS ME
A VOTE OR TWO ON THE JURY,

473
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,258
THEN THAT WILL BE A GREAT BONUS.

474
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,384
I'M SORRY, GUYS.

475
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,094
>> NO, NO, DON'T BE SORRY.

476
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:40,762
MAN, THAT'S MORE THAN I'VE DONE

477
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,222
THE WHOLE TIME
I'VE BEEN OUT HERE,

478
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,348
JUST THAT ONE MOMENT, YOU KNOW.

479
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:47,728
>> I FEEL BAD FOR MATT

480
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,605
AND HIS BROTHER,
RALPH AND HIS FRIEND,

481
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,315
BUT I'VE APOLOGIZED
TO THEM FOR THAT.

482
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,276
THAT'S THE BEST I CAN DO,
AND IT'S HARD FOR ME KNOW

483
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,613
I'VE LET MY FRIENDS DOWN,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

484
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,990
IT IS WHAT IT IS AT THIS POINT.

485
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,002
( CHEERS )

486
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:15,797
>> THIS IS OUR SHELTER.

487
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,049
>> I'LL SHOW YOU WHERE WE SLEEP.

488
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,468
>> WALKING INTO CAMP WITH OUR
LOVED ONES FEELS SO SURREAL.

489
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:23,138
I GOT TO SHOW MY MOM
WHERE I'VE BEEN LIVING,

490
00:20:23,221 --> 00:20:26,141
AND IT WAS JUST
LIKE EVERYTHING I NEEDED,

491
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:27,809
AND SO MUCH MORE.

492
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,435
>> I KEEP THE CALENDAR
EVERY DAY.

493
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,646
>> OH WOW.

494
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,647
>> I MARK IT OFF.

495
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,023
LIKE, YESTERDAY, WAS 30.

496
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,524
>> EVERYBODY SAYS,
"TELL HIM WE LOVE HIM!"

497
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,525
>> OKAY.

498
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,526
>> TELL HIM WE'RE SO PROUD.

499
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,653
>> COOL.

500
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,321
>> HOW DO YOU KEEP
YOUR HAIR SO NICE?

501
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,614
IT'S LOOKING GREAT.

502
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,324
YOU'RE WASTING MONEY
ALL THESE YEARS.

503
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,826
>> ADRIEN SENDS HER LOVE.

504
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,578
SHE WISHES SHE COULD BE HERE.

505
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,330
I WISH EVERYBODY
SHOULD SEE THIS.

506
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,666
>> IT'S SO MOTIVATING,
ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY

507
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,460
SEEING SOMEBODY
AND HEARING THEM TALK TO YOU

508
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:56,004
AND BEING ABLE TO LOOK
INTO THEIR EYES,

509
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,881
IT'S PRICELESS, MAN.

510
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,144
>> I'M FINE.

511
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,854
>> I KNOW.

512
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,731
>> I HAVE NEVER BEEN
AWAY FROM HOME

513
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:15,941
MORE THAN TWO WEEKS.

514
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,818
I'VE TALKED TO MY MOM EVERY DAY,

515
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,070
SO IT WAS JUST GOOD TO SEE HER

516
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,905
AND FOR HER TO TELL ME

517
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,658
HOW SHE'S PROUD OF ME

518
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:27,703
AND HOW MY FAMILY
IS DOING BACK HOME.

519
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,539
AND IT JUST MADE ME FEEL
LIKE I--

520
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,540
I CAN DO IT, AND I CAN PUSH

521
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,544
THROUGH THE NEXT SEVEN,
EIGHT DAYS.

522
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,378
>> THIS IS A SOCIAL GAME.

523
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,422
>> RIGHT.

524
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,340
>> I'M PREPARED TO GO CRAZY
IF I HAVE TO.

525
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,217
THAT'S WHAT WORKS FOR ME,
YOU KNOW.

526
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,678
JUST SEEING MY SISTER

527
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,222
AND SEEING HER CONFIDENCE IN ME

528
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:48,598
EMPOWERED ME AND RENEWED ME

529
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:52,436
AT ANOTHER LEVEL
TO CONTINUE TO DOMINATE.

530
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,232
CONTINUE TO DOMINATE.

531
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:58,692
AND BE WHO I AM.

532
00:21:58,775 --> 00:21:59,693
>> PHILLIP'S A NUT JOB.

533
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,904
HE'S A WHACKO, BUT HE'S,
LIKE, THE BIGGEST GOAT.

534
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:03,405
HE'S PISSED EVERYBODY HERE OFF.

535
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,741
>> OH, REALLY.

536
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,784
>> IF I DRAG HIM TO THE END,
HE DOESN'T GET ANY VOTES.

537
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,036
>> RIGHT.

538
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,370
>> YOU KNOW?

539
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,581
BUT YOU HAVE TO, LIKE, ALWAYS

540
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,916
ADJUST YOUR STRATEGY DAY BY DAY.

541
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,294
GRANT THINKS IT'S ME AND HIM.

542
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,421
NATALIE THINKS IT'S ME AND HER.

543
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,923
ALL THEY HAVE TO DO
IS TALK TO EACH OTHER,

544
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,508
BUT THEY WON'T, YOU KNOW.

545
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:28,930
I FEEL LIKE RIGHT NOW
I'M PLAYING MY BEST GAME,

546
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,266
BUT EVEN EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED

547
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,143
UP UNTIL RIGHT NOW,

548
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:36,229
MEANS NOTHING
UNLESS I CAN FINISH IT.

549
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,898
I NEED THIS.

550
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:41,068
IT'S TO MAKE A BETTER LIFE
FOR MY WIFE AND MY KIDS.

551
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,528
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE AT A POINT NOW

552
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,280
WHERE SOME PEOPLE MIGHT BE

553
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:46,740
TAKING A BREAK FROM THE GAME

554
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,241
AND THINKING ABOUT HOME,

555
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,285
IT JUST MAKES ME FOCUS.

556
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,745
I WANT TO WIN "SURVIVOR."

557
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,330
THIS IS SOMETHING
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO

558
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:53,872
FOR 10 YEARS NOW.

559
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,500
I'M EIGHT DAYS AWAY.

560
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,543
SO THERE'S NOTHING
THAT'S GOING TO STOP ME.

561
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,639
>> BA-DA-BUM!

562
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,933
GOOD MORNING, TREE MAIL.

563
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,310
RISE AND SHINE.

564
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,521
IT SAYS, "FEELING PRESSURED
TO STEP IT UP?

565
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:20,607
IS STRATEGY ON THE RISE?

566
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,193
IT'S AN UPHILL BATTLE,
NO MATTER HOW YOU TREAD

567
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:26,113
WHEN IMMUNITY IS THE PRIZE."

568
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,948
>> THERE'S THREE IN A ROW.

569
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,866
>> THIS MORNING WE GOT
TREE MAIL,

570
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,576
LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

571
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,495
BUT TONIGHT, I FEEL LIKE IT'S

572
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,623
NOT GOING TO BE TOO DIFFICULT.

573
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,625
THERE'S JUST ONE PERSON
THAT CAN'T WIN TODAY.

574
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:42,295
THE VOTE WILL PROBABLY GO
TOWARDS ANDREA.

575
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,507
SHE'S GREAT AT THE CHALLENGES,
AND STRATEGICALLY,

576
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,801
SHE PROBABLY KNOWS MORE
ABOUT THIS GAME

577
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,137
THAN EVERYONE
EXCEPT GRANT AND I.

578
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,514
THEREFORE, SHE'S GOT TO GO.

579
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,057
MY SISTER GAVE ME A SHIRT

580
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,059
WITH AMBER AND MY DAUGHTER,
LUCIA, ON IT,

581
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,687
AND I'M GOING TO WORK
MY ASS OFF TO MAKE SURE

582
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,814
ANDREA DOESN'T WIN IMMUNITY.

583
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,699
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

584
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,498
LOOKS A LITTLE DAUNTING?

585
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,041
>> A LITTLE BIT.

586
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,463
>> Jeff: GUYS READY TO GET
TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

587
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,423
>> YEAH.

588
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,424
>> WE ARE.

589
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:28,133
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
MARIANO,

590
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,218
ONCE AGAIN, I'LL TAKE IT BACK.

591
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:36,349
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY
IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.

592
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,559
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE,
YOU ARE GOING TO RACE

593
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,728
TO COLLECT A SERIES
OF PUZZLE STEPS.

594
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:43,106
YOU MUST THEN PLACE
THE STEPS IN ORDER

595
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,900
FROM BOTTOM TO TOP,

596
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,068
COMPLETING A VERY TALL
STAIRCASE.

597
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,446
FIRST PERSON TO FINISH
THEIR STAIRCASE AND GET

598
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:52,949
TO THE TOP WINS IMMUNITY
AND IS SAFE AT THE VOTE.

599
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,160
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL

600
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,912
WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT

601
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,747
AND SENT TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

602
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,540
I KNOW IT'S WORTH PLAYING FOR.

603
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,041
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS.

604
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,501
WE'LL GET STARTED.

605
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,715
WHATEVER YOU HAVE IN YOUR TANK

606
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,509
YOU NEED TO USE RIGHT NOW.

607
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,428
HERE WE GO, FOR IMMUNITY.

608
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:14,930
SURVIVORS READY?

609
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,224
GO!

610
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,100
FIRST YOU HAVE
TO UNTIE THE KNOTS.

611
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:22,229
THEN YOU HAVE TO GET THESE
PUZZLE STEPS TO YOUR PLANK.

612
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:25,273
THEN YOU'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT
WHICH ONE GOES FIRST.

613
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,444
ROB'S GOT HIS FIRST BOARD IN.

614
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:30,904
GRANT HAS ONE IN.

615
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,697
ANDREA'S IN IT.

616
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:37,160
IF YOU'RE WRONG,
YOU'VE GOT TO GO BACK DOWN.

617
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,704
YOU CAN ONLY BRING
ONE PLANK AT A TIME.

618
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,331
YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING

619
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,250
OR YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE TIME.

620
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,795
ANDREA IN THE LEAD.

621
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,798
SHE'S MOVING ON TO HER
SECOND SET OF STEPS.

622
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,634
ROB HAS HIS FIRST SET.

623
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,011
GRANT FINISHES HIS FIRST SET.

624
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,182
ASHLEY GOING TO FINISH UP
HER FIRST SET.

625
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,434
PHILLIP IS GOING VERY SLOW.

626
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:04,145
NATALIE HAVING NO LUCK AT ALL.

627
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,606
IT IS ROB, GRANT, AND ANDREA

628
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,026
WORKING ON THEIR SECOND SET
OF PUZZLE STEPS.

629
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,569
GRANT'S WRONG.

630
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,195
HE HEADS BACK DOWN.

631
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,489
ANDREA HAS HER FIRST STEP.

632
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:17,659
ROB HAS HIS FIRST STEP
OF THE SECOND SET.

633
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,870
ASHLEY STRUGGLING
TO STAY IN THIS.

634
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,998
GRANT HAS HIS FIRST BOARD.

635
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,833
ANDREA NOW IN THE LEAD
WITH HER SECOND BOARD.

636
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,627
ROB PICKED THE WRONG BOARD.

637
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:28,837
GOTTA GO BACK DOWN.

638
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,047
IT IS ANDREA AND GRANT
RIGHT NOW.

639
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:34,509
YOU NEED TO PICK IT UP
IF YOU WANT TO WIN!

640
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:39,014
SECOND PLACE BUYS YOU NOTHING
IN THIS CHALLENGE.

641
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,557
>> NO!

642
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,058
>> Jeff: ANDREA WITH A BIG
MISTAKE.

643
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,019
SHE GRABBED THE WRONG BOARD.

644
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,729
IT IS ROB AND GRANT NOW.

645
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:49,941
GRANT HAS HIS SECOND SET
FINISHED.

646
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,986
IT'S ABOUT 110 DEGREES TODAY.

647
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,989
ADDING TO THE DIFFICULTY.

648
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:57,866
ROB HAS COMPLETED
HIS SECOND SET.

649
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,869
GRANT HAS COMPLETED
HIS SECOND SET.

650
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,495
GRANT WORKING ON THE THIRD,

651
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,539
AND FINAL SET OF PUZZLE STEPS.

652
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:07,375
ANDREA'S COMPLETED
HER SECOND SET.

653
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,252
PHILLIP, ASHLEY, NATALIE,

654
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:12,172
HAVE FALLEN OUT
OF THIS CHALLENGE.

655
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,715
GRANT IS WRONG.

656
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,884
HE'S GOING TO HAVE
TO HEAD BACK DOWN.

657
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:19,596
ONCE AGAIN,
THE LEAD COULD CHANGE.

658
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,015
ROB HAS IT RIGHT!

659
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:24,059
ANDREA HAS HERS RIGHT!

660
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,478
GRANT IS WRONG AGAIN!

661
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:27,812
TWO MISTAKES FOR GRANT.

662
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:31,900
OPENING THE DOOR FOR ROB
AND ANDREA.

663
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,194
ANDREA HAS HER SECOND BOARD,

664
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,237
GRANT HAS HIS FIRST BOARD.

665
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,907
ROB STRUGGLING
TO GET UP THESE STEPS.

666
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,910
HE IS LITERALLY CARRYING
HIS FAMILY ON HIS BACK!

667
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,912
GRANT NOW MAKING UP GROUND.

668
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:47,749
GRANT HAS HIS SECOND BOARD.

669
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,126
ROB HAS HIS THIRD BOARD.

670
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,462
ANDREA RIGHT BEHIND.

671
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:56,758
ANDREA'S GOING TO NEED
A MISTAKE FROM ROB.

672
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,219
GRANT HAS HIS THIRD BOARD.

673
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,970
ROB HAS HIS FOURTH BOARD
IN PLACE.

674
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:04,224
ROB HAS TWO STEPS LEFT.

675
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:07,310
GRANT HAS THREE,
ANDREA HAS THREE.

676
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,604
IT IS GRANT AND ROB.

677
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:10,230
TIED.

678
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,941
BOTH WITH TWO STEPS LEFT.

679
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,944
ANDREA NOW WITH TWO STEPS LEFT.

680
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,946
ROB HIS LEGS NEARLY BUCKLING,

681
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:21,157
CRAWLING UP THESE STEPS.

682
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,410
ROB HAS ONE STEP LEFT!

683
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,161
GRANT HAS TWO!

684
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,498
ANDREA RIGHT BEHIND.

685
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:30,834
AS LONG AS ROB CAN GET UP,

686
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,961
HE WILL WIN THIS CHALLENGE.

687
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,297
GRANT HAS ONE STEP LEFT.

688
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,758
ANDREA, SHE'S GOT ONE STEP LEFT.

689
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,927
ROB WITH HIS LAST PUZZLE STEP.

690
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:45,306
STRUGGLING TO MAKE IT UP
WITHOUT COLLAPSING.

691
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,808
32 DAYS OF EXHAUSTION

692
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:50,145
SETTING IN.

693
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:53,022
GRANT RACING TO THE TOP.

694
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,941
THIS IS IT.

695
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:04,617
ROB CRAWLS TO THE TOP.

696
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,704
MARIANO WINS IMMUNITY!

697
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,423
GREAT EFFORT FROM EVERYBODY.

698
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:30,185
YOU ALL RIGHT, ROB?

699
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,519
>> IT'S HOT.

700
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,979
MY LEGS ARE BURNING.

701
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,397
I'LL LIVE, DUDE.

702
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,398
LET'S GO.

703
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,233
>> Jeff: NO, NO, NO,
RELAX, MAN.

704
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,822
>> SOME WATER?

705
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,365
>> Jeff: GOT IT?

706
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:48,786
ARE YOU CRAMPING?

707
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,371
>> YEAH.

708
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,210
>> OH!

709
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,586
GOD HELP ME.

710
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:57,921
>> Jeff: DO YOU WANT ME
TO HAVE MEDICAL LOOK AT YOU?

711
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:00,715
>> NO.

712
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:02,884
I THINK IF I COULD STAND,
IT WOULD BE BETTER.

713
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:06,137
>> HEY, COULD YOU GUYS
HELP ME STAND UP?

714
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,895
YEAH, THAT'S BETTER.

715
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:17,982
I'M ALL RIGHT.

716
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,156
I'M ALL RIGHT.

717
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,115
LET'S GO.

718
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,575
WE'LL GO BACK TO CAMP.

719
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,410
LET'S GO.

720
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,082
>> Jeff: MARIANO,
CAN YOU HOBBLE OVER HERE?

721
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,251
>> YES.

722
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,377
( APPLAUSE )

723
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,045
>> WAY TO GO, ROB!

724
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,424
>> Jeff: ONCE AGAIN,
BARELY STANDING,

725
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,093
MARIANO SAFE AT TONIGHT'S
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

726
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,929
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU,
AFTER 32 DAYS TOGETHER

727
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,932
IN ONE SOLID GROUP OF SIX,

728
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,101
THIS ALLIANCE IS ABOUT
TO BE BROKEN UP.

729
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,727
SEE YOU TONIGHT
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL

730
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,104
WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT

731
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,397
AND SENT TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

732
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,439
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

733
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,066
>> THANKS.

734
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,134
( APPLAUSE )

735
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:29,012
>> OH, MAN, MY LEGS
ARE LIKE JELL-O.

736
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,305
>> I KNOW.

737
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,639
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE--

738
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,974
I COULDN'T BREATHE, YOU KNOW?

739
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,018
PHYSICALLY, THE CHALLENGE,

740
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:38,813
I HAD TO LITERALLY
GIVE EVERYTHING I HAD.

741
00:31:38,896 --> 00:31:40,189
AFTERWARDS,
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DIE.

742
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:43,901
BUT I FIGURE,
I'M SEVEN DAYS AWAY.

743
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,321
AND I'M GIVING IT
EVERYTHING I GOT.

744
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,490
ONE OF US HAS TO GO
TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

745
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,368
I MEAN, THAT'S A FACT.

746
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,078
THERE ARE TWO MAIN THINGS

747
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,121
THAT I GAIN FROM WINNING
IMMUNITY TODAY.

748
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:59,334
NUMBER ONE, I'M NOT GOING HOME
NO MATTER WHAT.

749
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,462
AND NUMBER TWO,
ALL MY OPTIONS ARE OPEN,

750
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:04,172
AND I CAN DECIDE
WHO'S GOING HOME.

751
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,174
>> SO WE'RE ALL GOOD, RIGHT?

752
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,843
>> YEAH.

753
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:10,720
>> YEAH, RIGHT?

754
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:13,806
>> TONIGHT WE'RE GOING
TO VOTE OFF ANDREA.

755
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,183
SHE'S ONE OF THE STRONGEST
COMPETITORS

756
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:19,187
IN THE CHALLENGES,
PLUS HER RELATIONSHIP

757
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,482
WITH MATT ON REDEMPTION ISLAND
IS STILL A THREAT.

758
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:23,149
>> ARE WE VOTING PHILLIP?

759
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:25,401
IS THAT THE PLAN?

760
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,027
LIKE, FOR SURE?

761
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,029
>> YEAH.

762
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,155
>> IT WILL BE A SHOCK
TO HER, I THINK,

763
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:33,993
BUT THERE IS NO MORE
ZAPATERA LEFT AT CAMP.

764
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,371
SO SHE NEEDS TO GO.

765
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,747
>> SHE HAS NO IDEA.

766
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,581
SHE'S NOT GOING
TO SEE IT COMING.

767
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,208
>> LOVERS ARE GOING
TO BE REUNITED.

768
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,224
>> PHILLIP, SOMEBODY'S GOING

769
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,726
TO COME BACK FROM REDEMPTION,

770
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,937
AND I DON'T WANT THEM
SLEEPING NEXT TO ME.

771
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,897
>> THERE'S PLENTY DOWN
ON THE SIDE THERE.

772
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,440
THEY'LL HAVE TO PATCH IT UP.

773
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,068
>> WE'RE ALL COMPLETELY SET
ON GETTING RID OF ANDREA,

774
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:11,572
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
PHILLIP REGAINS HIS SPOT

775
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,241
IN OUR TRIBE
AS ANNOYANCE NUMBER ONE.

776
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,452
HE STARTED DRIVING
EVERYONE CRAZY.

777
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,163
>> THERE'S A WASP NEAR YOU,
BE CAREFUL.

778
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,082
DON'T MOVE YOUR ARMS SO QUICKLY.

779
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,084
>> DON'T YELL AT ME!

780
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,919
>> I'M JUST TRYING TO TELL YOU
WHEN YOU DO

781
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:26,212
QUICK ACTIONS AROUND THEM
THAT UPSETS THEM.

782
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,922
>> I'M NOT STUPID.

783
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:30,717
>> WELL, YOU WERE MOVING
YOUR ARMS QUICKLY.

784
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,723
>> STRAIGHT BACK
TO NORMAL FELIPE.

785
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,933
>> I'M TELLING YOU MAN,
THAT FEELING IN MY STOMACH

786
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:40,143
HASN'T CHANGED SINCE DAY ONE.

787
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:43,104
>> I COULD BE WRONG,
BUT I'M NOT CONCERNED

788
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,273
ABOUT GOING HOME TONIGHT

789
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:48,776
BECAUSE EARLY ON IN THE GAME,

790
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,570
I MADE MYSELF THE VILLAIN.

791
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,196
SO THAT EVERYONE
IN MY TRIBE FEELS

792
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,741
THAT THEIR BEST CHANCE
OF WINNING

793
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,451
AGAINST ANYBODY IS ME.

794
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,328
IT'S BRILLIANT STRATEGY,
AND I NEED TO KIND OF PUT

795
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,706
A LITTLE SALT ON THAT WOUND
EVERY NOW AND THEN

796
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,916
TO MAKE SURE FOLKS
DON'T FORGET THAT.

797
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:10,423
THESE FISHNETS REMAINED
IN PLACE,

798
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,800
THE ENTIRE TIME.

799
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,260
ALL OF A SUDDEN,

800
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:16,512
BOTH OF THEM END UP LIKE THIS.

801
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,809
YOU MANGLED MY NET.

802
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:22,310
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOUR ROOF?

803
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,771
THE HELL YOU SAY?

804
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,023
I THINK ROB FEELS VERY STRONGLY

805
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,316
THAT IF IT'S HIM AND I
IN THE FINAL,

806
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,152
THAT HE CAN WIN
THE MILLION DOLLARS.

807
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,613
BUT I HAVE AN ORAL ARGUMENT

808
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,990
THAT NOBODY HERE ON MY TRIBE,

809
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,326
INCLUDING HIM,
HAS THOUGHT OF IT.

810
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,452
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO SAY

811
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:42,663
TO MAKE EVERYBODY THINK TWICE
ABOUT VOTING FOR HIM,

812
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,665
REGARDLESS OF
EVERYTHING ELSE I'VE SAID.

813
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,418
HONESTLY,
I THINK I COULD DEFEAT ROB.

814
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,508
>> DUDE, WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

815
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,635
IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE, RIGHT?

816
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,220
WE GET RID OF ANDREA TONIGHT.

817
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,638
>> I DON'T KNOW.

818
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:01,182
I DON'T WANT TO ROCK THE BOAT,
BUT I'M THINKING

819
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,684
MAYBE WE SHOULD
VOTE OUT PHILLIP.

820
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,229
IT'S JUST THAT SINCE DAY ONE,

821
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,898
THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVEN'T TRUSTED.

822
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,858
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

823
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,860
I'M HAVING SOME SECOND THOUGHTS

824
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,320
AS TO WHO I WANT

825
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,363
TO SIT THERE WITH AT THE END.

826
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,241
IF I WERE TO KEEP
PHILLIP AROUND,

827
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,159
HE'S TERRIBLE IN CHALLENGES.

828
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,869
AND HE'S A GOAT, PERFECT PERSON

829
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,204
TO TAKE TO THE END.

830
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,331
AT THE SAME TIME,
PHILLIP COULD BE PLAYING ME.

831
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,041
HE'S PRETTY GOOD WITH WORDS.

832
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:27,875
HE'S A GOOD SPEAKER.

833
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,377
SO WHEN IT COMES DOWN
TO THE JURY,

834
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,171
THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM.

835
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,381
IS HE THAT GOOD?

836
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,882
I DON'T KNOW.

837
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,092
>> HAS HE SAID ANYTHING TO YOU?

838
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,426
>> HE HASN'T SAID
ANYTHING AT ALL.

839
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,554
ON THE OTHER HAND,
ANDREA'S A COMPETITTOR.

840
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:43,057
IF SHE SITS AT THE END
SHE COULD POSSIBLY BEAT ME.

841
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,226
IF I MAKE THE WRONG DECISION,

842
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,394
32 DAYS OF HARD WORK

843
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:50,106
COULD BE GONE JUST LIKE THAT.

844
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,707
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

845
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:15,172
DAVID, JULIE, AND STEVE.

846
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,554
THE TIME HAS FINALLY COME.

847
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,431
AFTER DOMINATING FOR 32 DAYS

848
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,474
AND VOTING EVERYBODY ELSE
OUT OF THIS GAME,

849
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:28,311
THIS TIGHT GROUP OF SIX
HAS TO VOTE

850
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,605
ONE OF THEIR OWN
OUT OF THIS GAME.

851
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:33,774
ANDREA, CONCERNED AT ALL
AS WE SIT HERE RIGHT NOW?

852
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,109
>> FOR MYSELF?

853
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:36,068
>> Jeff: YEAH.

854
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,361
>> I FEEL CONFIDENT
IN THE RELATIONSHIPS

855
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,114
I'VE BUILT WITHIN
THE OMETEPE SIX,

856
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:42,450
SO I FEEL SAFE TONIGHT.

857
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,452
I MEAN, YOU CAN NEVER
BE CERTAIN IN THIS GAME,

858
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,579
BUT AS OF NOW, I FEEL LIKE

859
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,331
I'M TRUSTING THE RIGHT PEOPLE.

860
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:51,208
>> Jeff: SO, NATALIE, IS IT

861
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,376
KIND OF EXCITING
TO BE AT TRIBAL COUNCIL?

862
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,670
IS IT TERRIFYING?

863
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:57,798
>> IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

864
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:58,424
IT'S NERVE-RACKING.

865
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,801
IT'S SCARY.

866
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,469
AND IT'S NOT FUN.

867
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,931
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT FUN TONIGHT.

868
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,474
>> Jeff: PHILLIP, YOU MADE
A POINT ABOUT SAYING,

869
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,476
"I'M THE SIXTH MAN
ON THIS GROUP,

870
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,103
AND I'M FINE WITH THAT."

871
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,606
WELL, THERE'S ONLY
SIX PEOPLE LEFT.

872
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,733
SO IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S
A VERY GOOD CHANCE

873
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,485
IT SHOULD BE YOU TONIGHT.

874
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,946
IS THERE ANY PART OF YOU
THAT MIGHT BE LYING DOWN

875
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,197
AND SAYING, "YOU KNOW WHAT?

876
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,490
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO LOOK
LIKE A THREAT."

877
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,159
BECAUSE YOU AND NATALIE WEREN'T
EVEN COMPETITIVE TODAY.

878
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:26,327
>> TODAY, IT WAS 110 DEGREES.

879
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,371
I'M A 52-YEAR-OLD MAN.

880
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:32,166
CLEARLY, ON THAT
PARTICULAR EVENT,

881
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,834
I WAS OUT OF MY LEAGUE.

882
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:34,502
I'VE BEEN WAITING AND HOPING

883
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,544
THAT WE WOULD DO SOMETHING

884
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,797
THAT REQUIRED
UPPER BODY STRENGTH

885
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,340
BECAUSE WHEN I WENT IN THE ARMY,

886
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,926
AT 29, OUT OF 1500 MEN,

887
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,011
NO MAN COULD OUTRUN ME,

888
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,346
DO MORE PUSH-UPS, MORE SIT-UPS.

889
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,389
>> Jeff: PHILLIP,
I'M MAKING THE ARGUMENT

890
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:49,684
THE REASON TO
KEEP YOU IS BECAUSE

891
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,686
YOU AREN'T A THREAT
AND YOU RAISE YOUR HAND

892
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,020
AND SAY, "I'M A HUGE THREAT.

893
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,355
I JUST HAVEN'T HAD
THE RIGHT CHALLENGE."

894
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,525
ANDREA, YOU WERE VERY
COMPETITIVE TODAY.

895
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,403
ARE WE AT A POINT
IN THE GAME WHERE ABILITY

896
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:04,490
TO BE COMPETITIVE STILL
MIGHT MAKE YOU A TARGET

897
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,534
BECAUSE YOU COULD WIN
YOUR WAY TO THE END?

898
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,661
>> I REALIZE THAT IT'S
AN INDIVIDUAL GAME

899
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,371
BUT WE ALSO WANT TO KEEP
OUR TRIBE STRONG

900
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,290
BECAUSE WHOEVER IS COMING
BACK FROM REDEMPTION,

901
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,042
WE NEED TO BEAT THEM.

902
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,753
>> Jeff: SO, GRANT,
ARE YOU HAVING TO PLAY

903
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:18,546
YOUR OWN PSYCHOLOGICAL GAME

904
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,173
OF THIS IS WHY
YOU SHOULD KEEP ME

905
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,508
AND NOT GET RID OF ME.

906
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,218
>> TO A CERTAIN DEGREE.

907
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:26,220
I CAME INTO THIS GAME
KNOWING MYSELF

908
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:27,555
AND THIS IS WHO I AM.

909
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,514
THERE'S ONE THING YOU CAN'T
TAKE AWAY FROM ANYBODY,

910
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:29,557
IF THEY'RE BEING THEMSELVES,

911
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,393
THEIR TRUE SELVES
YOU CAN TELL

912
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,021
AND IF THEY'RE BEING FAKE,
YOU CAN TELL THAT, TOO,

913
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:35,730
AND PUTTING ON A FRONT
JUST TO SAY,

914
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,357
"HEY, I WANT A MILLION DOLLARS."

915
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,193
>> Jeff: PHILLIP,
SHARE WITH ME SOME INSIGHT

916
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,528
BASED ON YOUR BACKGROUND
AS COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE,

917
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,698
AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME,
CAN YOU MAKE IT

918
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:48,075
TO THE END IF YOU ARE TRUTHFUL?

919
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:48,743
>> ABSOLUTELY.

920
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:51,245
I'LL MAKE THE CASE WITH MYSELF.

921
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:52,413
I HAVE FORMED NO ALLIANCES

922
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,291
WHERE I, YOU KNOW, BROKE THEM.

923
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:57,001
I THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS ME

924
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:59,128
TO BE, YOU KNOW,
THE SENIOR STATESMAN.

925
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,922
I'M A GUY WHO LEADS BY EXAMPLE.

926
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,632
DON'T KNOW FOR SURE, BUT I THINK

927
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,801
I'M A GUY THAT YOU WANT
TO HAVE AROUND.

928
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,387
>> Jeff: HERE'S THE GREAT THING
ABOUT THE VOTE TONIGHT,

929
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,056
UNLESS I'M WRONG, DOES ANYBODY

930
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,516
TRULY FEEL INSECURE
AT THIS MOMENT?

931
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,562
ROB, THAT'S THE PRO AND THE CON

932
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,439
OF WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE BUILT.

933
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,816
THE PRO IS YOU WERE SO SOLID,

934
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,610
YOU WERE ABLE
TO DESTROY ANOTHER TRIBE.

935
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,653
THE CON IS YOU'RE SO SOLID,

936
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:27,323
SOMEBODY'S ABOUT TO GET
BLINDSIDED.

937
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,950
>> YEAH, I MEAN, AND THIS
IS A TOUGH DECISION TONIGHT,

938
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:33,245
BUT I FEEL A LOT BETTER
WITH THIS AROUND MY NECK.

939
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,956
BUT I'LL TELL YOU,
HAD GRANT WON THIS TODAY

940
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,084
OR ANYBODY ELSE FOR THAT MATTER,

941
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,628
I WOULD BE FEELING IT.

942
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,630
>> Jeff: PHILLIP,
BEFORE WE VOTE,

943
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,590
SHARE ONE LITTLE NUGGET
THAT YOU THINK

944
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,133
YOUR GREAT-GRANDFATHER
WOULD SAY

945
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,093
IF HE WERE HERE RIGHT NOW.

946
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:50,179
>> HE'D SAY, "YOU'VE DONE
EVERYTHING RIGHT

947
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,597
TO GET TO THIS POINT.

948
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,560
HOLD THE FAITH."

949
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:01,649
>> Jeff: OKAY,
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

950
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:02,650
ROB HAS THE NECKLACE.

951
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,819
YOU CANNOT VOTE FOR ROB.

952
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,487
EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.

953
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,531
NATALIE, YOU'RE UP.

954
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,606
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY
THE VOTES.

955
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,865
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL

956
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,032
AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

957
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,285
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME
TO DO SO.

958
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:57,371
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,

959
00:40:57,454 --> 00:40:58,497
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

960
00:40:58,581 --> 00:40:59,540
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

961
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,375
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL
AREA IMMEDIATELY.

962
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,002
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

963
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,256
FIRST VOTE, ANDREA.

964
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:12,595
PHILLIP.

965
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:18,726
ANDREA.

966
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,019
>> OH, MY GOD.

967
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:20,603
>> Jeff: TWO VOTES ANDREA,
ONE VOTE PHILLIP.

968
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,272
>> SHE GOT BLINDSIDED.

969
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,359
>> Jeff: ANDREA.

970
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:30,237
THAT'S THREE VOTES ANDREA,
ONE VOTE PHILLIP.

971
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,741
14th PERSON VOTED OUT.

972
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,910
ANDREA.

973
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:36,911
THAT'S FOUR.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

974
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,412
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

975
00:41:38,495 --> 00:41:40,247
>> TRICKY, TRICKY.

976
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,837
>> Jeff: ANDREA,
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

977
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,716
YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE
TO GET BACK IN THIS GAME.

978
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:51,717
GRAB YOUR TORCH.

979
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,718
HEAD TO REDEMPTION.

980
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,720
GOOD LUCK.

981
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,062
WELL, THAT'S ONE BLINDSIDE.

982
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:05,064
I HAVE A FEELING
IT WON'T BE THE LAST.

983
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,148
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

984
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,149
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

985
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,026
GOOD NIGHT.

986
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,746
>> JEFF: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

987
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,834
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME
ON "SURVIVOR":

988
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,127
>> AND THEN THERE WERE FIVE!

989
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,671
>> I LOVE BLINDSIDES.

990
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,256
>> Jeff: THIS CLOSE TO THE END.

991
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:30,965
>> SPLITTING THEM UP
IS THE BEST ROUTE.

992
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,841
>> KNOW THAT I HAVE YOUR BACK.

993
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,134
ASHLEY CAN'T BE TRUSTED.

994
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,135
>> Jeff: EVERY...

995
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,428
>> THAT IS A SNAKE, BRO.

996
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,429
>> Jeff: MOMENT...

997
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,430
>> I DON'T GIVE A ( BLEEP ).

998
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:39,431
>> GET OUT OF OUR FACE.

999
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:40,599
>> Jeff: COUNTS.

1000
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,309
>> ONE THING YOU DON'T
WANT TO HAPPEN,

1001
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:42,726
IT HAPPENED.

1002
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,611
>> WELL, OBVIOUSLY,
I'M A LITTLE BITTER.

1003
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,321
ALL OF THEM, EXCEPT
FOR PHILLIP, YOU KNOW,

1004
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:54,989
LOOKED ME IN THE EYES

1005
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,658
AND SAID WE'RE VOTING PHILLIP,

1006
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,327
AND SOMEWHERE DURING THE DAY
THEY ALL WENT

1007
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,996
BEHIND MY BACK AND SAID
WE'RE VOTING ANDREA.

1008
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:02,705
IT IS REALLY HARD TO BE LIVING

1009
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:04,999
WITH THESE PEOPLE FOR 32 DAYS

1010
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,292
AND HAVE THESE RELATIONSHIPS

1011
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:07,126
AND WHAT YOU THINK IS TRUST

1012
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:09,169
AND FIND OUT
THAT THEY'VE BEEN LYING

1013
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,254
TO YOU THE ENTIRE TIME.
