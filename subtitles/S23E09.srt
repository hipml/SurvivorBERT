DROP YOUR BUFFS.

00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:09,426
Jeff: AND OZZY RETURNED

00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:11,344
I'M ALIVE.

10
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:14,639
BUT AT THIS POINT IT'S A

11
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:15,974
DEAD-LOCKED 6-6 VOTE.

12
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:16,975

00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:31,489
INTO JUMPING SHIP.

20
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,783
WHERE AM I SLEEPING TONIGHT?

21
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,285
RIGHT BETWEEN ME AND EDNA.

22
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,287
Jeff: AT THE IMMUNITY

23
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,288
CHALLENGE THERE WERE TWO

24
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,038

00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:45,420
Jeff: OZZY GAVE HIS

00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,173
FIRST VOTE.

32
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,467
BUT WHITNEY DIDN'T RECEIVE ANY

33
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:50,884
VOTES.

34
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,302
WE ARE TIED.

35
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,970

SENDING KEITH TO REDEMPTION

39
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:02,812
ISLAND.

40
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:03,521
KEITH, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

41
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,440
NOW THE FORMER UPOLU TRIBE PLUS

42
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:06,816
COCHRAN HAS TAKEN OVER THE GAME.

43
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,610
THAT WAS, WITHOUT QUESTION, THE

44
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:09,319
BIGGEST MOVE IN THE GAME THUS

45
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,322
FAR AND THIS GAME IS FAR FROM

46
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:22,415

47
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:38,515
OVER.

48
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,351
WHAT'S UP, MAN?

49
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,186
IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH,

50
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,312
LIKE, GETTING BACK AT YOU OR

51
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,021
HURTING ANYBODY.

52
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:47,398
IT WAS-- I DIDN'T-- YOU KNOW,

53
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,234
I'VE BEEN OBSESSED WITH THIS FOR

54
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,360
11 YEARS.

55
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,362
TO HAVE MY FATE DECIDED BY

56
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,864
PICKING A STONE OUT OF A BAG.

57
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,699
COCHRAN, YOU TOTALLY SCREWED

58
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,408
ME OVER.

59
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,537
AND, ALSO,-- I'M JUST TRYING TO

60
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,372
TALK TO HIM ALONE.

61
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,915
I'D RATHER--

62
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:04,707
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

63
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,875
I'LL TELL HIM.

64
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,711
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

65
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,380
NOBODY'S BEING AGGRESSIVE WITH

66
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,214
HIM OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

67
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:11,965
COME ON.

68
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:12,924
I'M NOT GOING TO BE AGGRESSIVE.

69
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:13,883
I KNOW--

70
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,094
OZZY-- OZZY-- OZZY--

71
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:16,803
IT'S JUST ME AND HIM.

72
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,263
WE'RE NOT, LIKE, GANGSTERS OUT

73
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:22,392
HERE, MAN.

74
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,019
I MEAN, YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND,

75
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,354
LIKE, I PUT MY ASS ON THE LINE

76
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:29,065
FOR YOU DIRECTLY, PERSONALLY,

77
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,733
AND YOU JUST TURNED TARND AND

78
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:31,359
YOU JUST STABBED ME IN THE BACK

79
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:35,071
SO HARD.

80
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,199
THIS WAS SELF-INTEREST,

81
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:38,908
SELF-PRESERVATION

82
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,620
COCHRAN SAID IT WAS ALL ABOUT

83
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,580
SELF-PRESERVATION, AND SURE,

84
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:44,622
THAT'S THE EASY WAY OUT.

85
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,915
THAT'S HOW A WEANER PLAYS.

86
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,458
I HOPE YOU MAKE IT FAR.

87
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:47,917
THAT'S TOO BAD.

88
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,460
YOU'RE A COWARD.

89
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,504
YOU'RE A POOR EXCUSE FOR A MANY.

90
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,423
DON'T ( BLEEP ) ME EVER AGAIN.

91
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,799

00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,438
KEITH AND I SAVED YOU THREE

100
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,147
TIMES.

101
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,774
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU ( BLEEP )

102
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:12,317
DO.

103
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,318
IT WASN'T-- AGAINST YOU.

104
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,904
REALLY?

105
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:16,446
REALLY?

106
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:16,779
IT WASN'T AGAINST ME.

107
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,405

WE'RE GOING TO BE KNOCKED OUT

113
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,248
ONE BY ONE.

114
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,208
YOU'VE GOT A LOT TO LEARN,

115
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:29,667
BUDDY.

116
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:35,298

GETTA A FROSTY RECEPTION,

122
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,312
WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLE.

123
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,813
I'M KIND OF HAVING MIX

124
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,481
EMOTIONS RIGHT NOW.

125
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,192
ON THE ONE HAND, I'M GLAD I KIND

126
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,152
OF STOOD UP TO THE PEOPLE WHO

127
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:57,987
REPEATEDLY REFERRED TO ME AS

128
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,656
INDECISIVE, WEAK, EVEN ANNOYING.

129
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,365
BUT IT'S KIND OF A WEIRD

130
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,617
BALANCING ACT I'M DOING RIGHT

131
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,701
NOW BETWEEN THE UPOLU MEMBERS

132
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:07,163
WHO ARE NOW EMBRACING ME MORE

133
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:07,872
THAN EVER.

134
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:08,623
DON'T FEEL GUILTY.

135
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,333
YOU DIDN'T DO A THING WRONG.

136
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,627
AND MY FORMER TRIBEMATES WHO

137
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,420
SEEM TO REALLY, REALLY HATE MY

138
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:20,385
GUTS.

139
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:26,641
PIECE OF ( BLEEP ) NERD.

140
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:27,266
Captioning brought to you by

141
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,437

WE PULLED OFF AN AMAZING FEAT

143
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,963
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL LAST NIGHT.

144
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,632
OUR TRIBE OF UPOLU MEMBERS STOOD

145
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,260
SIX STRONG.

146
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:48,097
AGAINST ALL ODDS, AND IT'S CAUSE

147
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:48,890
FOR CELEBRATION.

148
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,433
IT'S CAUSE FOR WALKING THE

149
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,059
BEACH.

150
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,895
SAYING A LITTLE PRAYER.

151
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,229
STARTING THE DAY OFF RIGHT.

152
00:05:55,313 --> 00:06:00,359
DO A LITTLE THI CHI.

153
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,611
I FEEL LIKE IF I CAN JUST BE

154
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,614
CONFIDENT AND NOT ARROGANT, I

155
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,575
CAN BE HUMBLE, BUT NOT WEAK, I

156
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,660
THINK I HAVE A GOOD SHOT AT

157
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:21,297
GOING ALL THE WAY.

158
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,092
IN TERMS OF, LIKE, CHALLENGE,

159
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,301
OZZY IS OBVIOUSLY-- IF HE

160
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,677
DOESN'T WIN, IT'S PROBABLY SMART

161
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:27,678
TO GET RID OF HIM.

162
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,431
ON A PERSONAL LEVEL JIM.

163
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,101
REALLY?

164
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:36,145
"SURVIVOR" CAN BE REALLY CUT

165
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,355
THROAT AND YOU HAVE TO TRUST

166
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,064
PEOPLE AT CERTAIN POINTS AND

167
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,024
THOSE PEOPLE CAN TURN AROUND AND

168
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,151
JUST STICK A KNIFE RIGHT IN YOUR

169
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,403
GUT, AND THAT'S WHAT COCHRAN

170
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,113
DID.

171
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:45,947
SO MY TOTAL STRATEGY IS GONE.

172
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,533
I HAVE NOTHING MORE I CAN DO.

173
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:51,077
I'M JUST GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING.

00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,162

00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:54,705
GOING TO KEEP ON WINNING UNTIL

177
00:06:54,789 --> 00:07:05,341
THERE'S NO ONE LEFT.

SOPHIE TRYING TO CATCH JIM.

291
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,393
THAT'S NOT GOING TO DO IT.

292
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,936
GO TO BATTLE, SOPH.

293
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,897

295
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:54,612
COULD JIM DO IT RIGHT HERE?

296
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:55,071

314
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,437
HUGE SETBACK FOR SOPHIE.

SO THERE'S NO IF, ANDS, BUTS

336
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:32,793

IT'S GOING TO BE SIX VOTES

338
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:35,588
TOWARD OZZY.

339
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,673
WE JUST HAVE TO GO FOR IT, DUDE.

340
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,634
HOW MANY CHANCES DO YOU GET TO

341
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,802
VOTE HIM OUT OF THIS GAME?

342
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:42,511
APPARENTLY TWO.

343
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,597
OH, YEAH.

344
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,063
I DON'T WANT TO GO.

345
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,274
YOU KNOW.

346
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,692
THAT'S REALLY ALL I CAN OFFER IS

347
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,194
JUST WHO I AM.

348
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,529
YEAH.

349
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,864
OZZY KNOWS THAT THERE'S A GOOD

350
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,532
CHANCE HE COULD GET VOTED OUT

351
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,200
TONIGHT.

352
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:04,909
AND THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE

353
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,702
BETWEEN YESTERDAY WHEN HE HELD

354
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:07,286
ALL THE CARDS AND THE COKENESS

355
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,038
THAT HE HAD, AND TODAY.

356
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:09,997
THAT'S IT.

357
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,041
I DON'T WANT YOU TO LEAVE,

358
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:12,625
MAN.

359
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,126
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE,

360
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:14,793
EITHER.

361
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,671
I ACTUALLY APPRECIATE OZZY'S

362
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,380
HUMILITY.

363
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,256
IF IT'S FAKE, IF IT'S TOO LATE,

364
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,009
OR IF IT'S JUST BORNE OUT OF

365
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,719
DESPERATION, THAT'S OKAY.

366
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,889
SOME OF THE GREATEST INSPIRATION

367
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:30,559
IS BORNE OF DESPERATION, MARCUS

368
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,602
ARILLUOUS ONCE SAID.

369
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,062
BUT AT THIS POINT, IT'S TOO

370
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,232
LITTLE, TOO LATE.

371
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,399
IT WAS A GOOD RIDE.

372
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,734
OH, YOU'RE COMING BACK.

373
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,236
I'M CONVINCED OF THAT.

374
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:40,653
I'LL TRY.

375
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:46,033
COME ON, MAN.

376
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,619

377
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,036

378
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,579
JUST TRY IT.

379
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,122
THERE'S A PILLOW, TOO.

380
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,208
I THINK-- DON'T YOU THINK YOU

381
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,876
SHOULD HAVE A BLANKET AND A

382
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,086
PILLOW TONIGHT, NOW THAT THE

383
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,087
HAPPINESS IS--

384
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,922
I THINK THAT WOULD BE

385
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:00,548
AWESOME.

386
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,091
WE GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL

387
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:02,716
TONIGHT.

388
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,008
THERE'S REALLY FOUR SAVAII

389
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:03,467
MEMBERS.

390
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,386
JIM HAS IMMUNITY.

391
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:09,598
OZZY, MYSELF, OR WHITNEY ARE

392
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,600
GOING TO REDEMPTION.

393
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,602
WE EITHER HAVE TO REALLY STAY

394
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,895
LOYAL TO THE FINAL FOUR OF US

395
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,106
AND JUST GO DOWN IN FLAMES OR

396
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,774
I'M GOING TO NEED TO CONSIDER

397
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,442
FLIPPING AND VOTING WITH THE

398
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,735
UPOLU TRIBE.

399
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,405
THAT'S A LITTLE PILLOW.

400
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,407
IT WILL BE LIKE A DAY AT THE

401
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,993
SPA.

402
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,245
I'M EASILY THE MOST HATED

403
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,621
PERSON IN THIS CAMP RIGHT NOW

404
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,664
BECAUSE I SPEAK MY MIND.

405
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:34,915
EVERYTHING I SAID ABOUT COCHRAN

406
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:35,374
IS TRUE.

407
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,083
RIGHT, TOTALLY.

408
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,627
HE'S THE POOREST EXCUSE FOR A

409
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,295
MAN THEY KNOW.

410
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,129
I TOLD HIM HE DISGUSTED ME.

411
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:40,754
HE DOES.

412
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,674
I COULD NEVER HAVE EVER

413
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:44,925
THROWN MY TRIBE UNDER THE BUS

414
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,135
LIKE COCHRAN DID TO US.

415
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,095
I CALL A COWARD A COWARD.

416
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,805
THAT'S ME.

417
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:54,435
BECAUSE I'M NOT A COWARD.

418
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,269
I HAVE AN IDEA.

419
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:55,978
I HAVE NOTHING.

420
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,479
HERE'S WHAT I GOT.

421
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,981
I'M GOING TO DO IT.

422
00:14:59,064 --> 00:14:59,982
DON'T SAY NO.

423
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,318
JUST LISTEN TO WHAT I SAY.

424
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,652
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THE

425
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,154
NECKLACE TONIGHT AND SAY,UN

426
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:05,738
WHAT?

427
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:06,655
THERE ARE 11 PEOPLE HERE.

428
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,992
AND 10 OF US HAVE PLAYED WITH

429
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,118
COMPLETE HONOR, STUCK WITH THEIR

430
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:11,827
TRIBE.

431
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,411
THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON OUT OF

432
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,787
THE 11 PEOPLE HERE THAT'S

433
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:14,371
TURNED.

434
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,123
YOU GUYS STILL HAVE A 6-4

435
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,708
ADVANTAGE ON US, BUT I'M ASKING

436
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,460
YOU TONIGHT TO VOTE FOR COCHRAN.

437
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,169
I THINK WE'VE GOT A SHOT FOR TWO

438
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,004
PEOPLE TONIGHT, ESPECIALLY IF

439
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,673
THEY ALL GO IN THINKING VOTING

440
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:25,382
OZZY.

441
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,050
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY DON'T

442
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,676
GET A CHANCE TO TALK AND THE

443
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,803
LAST WORDS THAT THEY HEAR ARE

444
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,847
"VOTE COCHRAN" WITH A PRETTY

445
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:32,681
COMPELLING CASE.

446
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,682
IT'S CRAZY, MAN.

447
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,351
IF I DON'T GO TONIGHT, I GO

448
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,060
TOMORROW NIGHT.

449
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,478
IF I DON'T GO TOMORROW NIGHT, I

450
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,228
GO THE NEXT NIGHT.

451
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,189
I REALLY DON'T HAVE MANY NIGHTS

452
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,190
LEFT HERE.

453
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,818
SO MY HOPE SICAN GIVE A ROUSING

454
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:45,527
ENOUGH SPEECH AT TRIBAL COUNCIL

455
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,987
TO GET A COUPLE OF THEM TO FLIP

456
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,197
OVER TO COCHRAN.

457
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,698
I NEED TWO OF THEM TO GO FOR IT.

458
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,533
THAT'S ALL I NEED, TWO OF THOSE

459
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,076
SEVEN PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR

460
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:52,785
COCHRAN.

461
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,203
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE GOT A

462
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:54,870
GAME.

463
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:57,873
JIM, ALL I GOTTA SAY YOU WANT

464
00:15:57,956 --> 00:16:01,251
TO MAKE ME CRY RIGHT NOW.

465
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,086
EVERYTHING'S PRETTY SURREAL TO

466
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,337
ME RIGHT NOW.

467
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,506
I MEAN, IF JIM HONESTLY GIVES ME

468
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,007
THE IMMUNITY NECKLACE TONIGHT, I

469
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,425
DON'T-- I'LL BE-- I'LL FEEL LIKE

470
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:12,054
I'M DREAMING.

471
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,431
KNOWING JIM, I BELIEVE THAT IF

472
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,891
HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO GIVE ME

473
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:18,268
THE NECKLACE, I BELIEVE HE WILL.

474
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,771
WHO KNOWS WHALE HAPPEN IN THIS

475
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:21,230
GAME?

476
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,856
WHO REALLY KNOWS?

477
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,024
AND I'M NEVER GOING TO GIVE UP

478
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,192
AS LONG AS I LIVE.

479
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,069
AND CERTAINLY NOT HERE ON

480
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:31,198
"SURVIVOR."

481
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,423
Jeff: SO THE THEME OF THE

482
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,925
LAST TWO TRIBAL COUNCILS HAS

483
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:51,385
BEEN BIG MOVES.

484
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,761
COCHRAN, WHAT WAS THE REACTION

485
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,930
TO YOUR HUGE MOVE AT THE LAST

486
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:55,556
TRIBAL COUNCIL?

487
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,933
THE REACTION WAS

488
00:16:58,016 --> 00:17:00,769
UNDERSTANDABLY KIND OF CHILLY, A

489
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,439
LUKEWARM RECEPTION, TO PUT IT

490
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,022
MILDLY.

491
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,065
Jeff: WHO FROM YOUR TRIBE

492
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:05,774
BARKED THE LOUDEST?

493
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,985
JIM IS IS GENERALLY A PRETTY

494
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:08,652
LOUD GUY SO IT WASN'T SURPRISING

495
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,780
THAT HE WAS ONE OF THE MORE

496
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:12,448
VOCAL CRITICS OF MY DECISION AND

497
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,241
BASICALLY DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR

498
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,200
ANYTHING I HAD TO SAY IN SUPPORT

499
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,494
OF MY DECISION.

500
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,162
Jeff: JIM.

501
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,456
I SAID SOME THINGS THAT WERE

502
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,165
IMMATURE.

503
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:21,790
THIS IS JUST A GAME BUT DITAKE

504
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,334
IT A LITTLE BIT PERSONAL?

505
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,294
YES, I DID.

506
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,503
Jeff: COCHRAN HOW DID YOU

507
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,171
DEAL WITH THE REACTIONS?

508
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:30,299
MAINLY BY STAYING SILENT AND

509
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:30,966
LISTENING.

510
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:31,633
IT WAS A PERSONAL DECISION.

511
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:32,801
I VIEWED IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

512
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,178
TAKE CONTROL OF MY OWN FATE IN

513
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,304
THIS GAME TO PLAY WITH THE SORT

514
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,638
OF GROUP OF PEOPLE I WANTED TO

515
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,306
PLAY WITH.

516
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,307
I DON'T MEAN ANY DISRESPECT TO

517
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,476
MY FORMER TRIBE MATES.

518
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,186
I KNOW IT SOUNDED HORRENDOUS.

519
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,104
YEAH, IT CAN DID.

520
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:44,772
YEAH.

521
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:45,439
DIDN'T MENTALLY PREPARE FOR

522
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:48,817
THIS FOR 11 YEARS TO HAVE MY

523
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:49,526
FATE DECIDED BY DRAWING A BAG.

524
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,614
THE LAST TIME PEOPLE DRAW ROCKS

525
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,657
WAS IN SEASON 4 BECAUSE PEOPLE

526
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,619
REALIZED THAT'S NOT HOW YOU PLAY

527
00:17:58,702 --> 00:17:59,328
"SURVIVOR."

528
00:17:59,411 --> 00:17:59,620
IT'S TAKING CONTROL OF MY OWN

529
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:00,245
FATE.

530
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,122
I CAN ADD ONE THING THAT I

531
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:02,790
THINK WILL ROUND IT OUT?

532
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,666
I SAVED COCHRAN IN THE FIRST

533
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,334
VOTE.

534
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,210
I SAVED COCHRAN IN THE SECOND

535
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,920
VOTE.

536
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,254
KEITH, WHITNEY, AND I, SAVED HIM

537
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,382
IN THE THIRD VOTE, AND OZZY

538
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,676
SAVED HIM AT REDEMPTION ISLAND.

539
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,179
AND I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW THE

540
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,388
UPOLU TRIBE THE LAST COUPLE OF

541
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,348
DAYS AND THERE'S NOT A SINGLE

542
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,851
ONE OF THEM THAT WOULD LET

543
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:23,852
SOMEBODY FIGHT THEIR FIGHTS FOR

544
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,647
THEM AND NOT SOMEBODY WHO WOULD

545
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,981
DO SOMETHING SO DISHONORABLE.

546
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,358
I THINK PROOF IS IN THE

547
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:29,942
PUDDING.

548
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,401
IF YOU REMEMBER FROM LAST

549
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,152
TRIBAL

550
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,029
IT WAS A WAY DIFFERENT TONE, WE

551
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:35,239
WERE BEING MADE FUN OF TO PLAY

552
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:35,989
WITH INTEGRITY.

553
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,199
IT'S KIND OF POETIC JUSTICE, TO

554
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:37,908
BE HONEST WITH YOU.

555
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,701
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT FEELING OF

556
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,370
GETTING TIRED OF BEING MADE FUN

557
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:41,870
OF.

558
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,538
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

559
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:42,996
THE SMALLER PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO

560
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,081
TAKE IT ANYMORE.

561
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:44,414
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE BULLIED

562
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,124
AROUND.

563
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,167
I JUST-- I JUST WANT TO NOTE,

564
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,044
DID I EVER BERATE YOU.

565
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:50,337
THE WHOLE TRIBE IS STANDING

566
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,046
BEHIND COCHRAN.

567
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:51,630
PERIOD.

568
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,508
I FEEL LIKE I'M BEING

569
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,175
VILLINIZED.

570
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,385
I JUST WANT TO KNOW, DIEVER

571
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,887
MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE

572
00:18:58,971 --> 00:18:59,555
SMALL?

573
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,223
YOU MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS

574
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,224
SMALL BY BASES YOUR FIRST

575
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,351
SEVERAL VOTES AGAINST ME AND

576
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,186
TRYING TO GET PEOPLE VOTE ME OUT

577
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,896
ON THE BASIS OF MY WEAKNESS.

578
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,064
Jeff: SO, JIM, VERY

579
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:10,232
POWERFUL SPOT RIGHT NOW FOR YOU.

580
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,276
SITTING WITH IMMUNITY.

581
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,735
WITHOUT A DOUBT.

582
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,237
I KNOW, I WIN IMMUNITY.

583
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,321
I IMMEDIATELY THINK I'M GOING TO

584
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,199
GIVE IT TO OZZY TONIGHT.

585
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:19,783
Jeff: WHY WOULD IT MAKE

586
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:23,412
SENSE TO GIVE OZZY YOUR

587
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,079
NECKLACE?

588
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,706
I HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW THESE

589
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:26,373
GUYS.

590
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,416
THEY CONSISTENTLY SAY HONOR,

591
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,000
HONOR, HONOR.

592
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,960
I KNOW THEY RESPECT US AS

593
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:30,669
COMPETITORS.

594
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:31,378
I KNOW THEY SEE I HAVE A WARRIOR

595
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:34,089
HEART AND A WARRIOR SOLE SOUL

596
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,257
AND THERE ARE 10 OF US THAT HAVE

597
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,092
NOT WAIVERRED FROM OUR TRIBE

598
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:37,759
ONCE.

599
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,719
THERE'S ONE PERSON WHO HAS.

600
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,429
TODAY AS ONE VOICE WE CAN SEND A

601
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,139
MESSAGE TO ANYBODY WHO EVER WILL

602
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,724
PLAY "SURVIVOR" THAT YOU CAN GO

603
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:44,433
THROUGH THIS GAME HONORABLY, AND

604
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,435
IF YOU'RE A TURNCOAT YOU GOT NO

605
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,604
PLACE IN MY TRIBE.

606
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,396
YOU CAN SAY THAT RIGHT NOW BY

607
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:53,942
VOTING OFF COCHRAN.

608
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:54,318
Jeff: COACH, JIM'S NOT

609
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:54,943
GIVING UP.

610
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,154
YEAH, I MEAN, ABSOLUTELY.

611
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,281
I MEAN, JIM STARTS TALKING ABOUT

612
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,616
WARRIOR THIS AND WARRIOR THAT

613
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,618
AND I STAND UP A LITTLE BIT

614
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,119
STRAIGHTER AND LISTEN WITH A

615
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:05,787
MORE ATTENTIVE EAR.

616
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,955
Jeff: IF YOU VOTED OUT

617
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,123
COCHRAN TONIGHT, WOULD IT CHANGE

618
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:08,707
THE GAME?

619
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,791
I THINK IT WOULD SEND A

620
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,126
MESSAGE TO EVERYTHING THAT IF

621
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:12,336
YOU STICK UP FOR YOURSELF,

622
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,629
YOU'RE GOING TO GET SCREWED.

623
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,338
AND I'M NOT-- I'M NOT GOING TO

624
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,465
SEE THAT HAPPEN.

625
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,467
DOES VOTING COCHRAN OUT

626
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,593
CHRONICLE THE NAME GAME?

627
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:20,802
NO, IT DOESN'T.

628
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:21,803
IT TAKE ONE PERSON OUT.

629
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,472
YOU STILL HAVE A 6-4 LEAD.

630
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,473
IT GIVES THESE GUYS AN

631
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,974
OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY SAY BEYOND

632
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,517
THIS GAME WHAT IS THIS GAME

633
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,311
ABOUT?

634
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,355
Jeff: SOPHIE, WHOEVER YOU

635
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,273
LEAVE IN THE GAME IS AS

636
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,317
IMPORTANT AS WHO YOU GOT RID OF.

637
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,152
I THINK RIGHT NOW, THERE'S--

638
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:38,320
THERE'S NO GOOD VOTE BECAUSE

639
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,821
WE'RE NOT ELIMINATING SOMEBODY

640
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:40,489
FOR SURE.

641
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,490
LET ME JUST THROW SOMETHING

642
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,240
OUT THERE.

643
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,618
WHEN I'M AT REDEMPTION, I'M NOT

644
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,160
FEEDING 11 PEOPLE.

645
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:45,702
I'M FEEDING MYSELF.

646
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,121
I'M GOING TO BE FULL.

647
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,498
I'M GOING TO BE WELL RESTED.

648
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,458
I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE TO WORRY

649
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,376
ABOUT EVERYBODY SCRAMBLING.

650
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,085
EVENTUALLY, THESE NUMBERS ARE

651
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,212
GOING TO START TO CHANGE, AND

652
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,546
YOU WILL ONLY HAVE YOURSELVES TO

653
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,214
VOTE OUT.

654
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,841
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS, IT'S

655
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,677
GOING TO GET A LITTLE FUNKY.

656
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,011
Jeff: AND, OZZY, IF IT IS

657
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:03,595
YOU TONIGHT, I'M GUESSING YOUR

658
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,807
MESSAGE WILL BE A LITTLE

659
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,642
DIFFERENT THAN "I'VE HAD A GREAT

660
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:09,351
TIME."

661
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,018
MY MESSAGE IS I WILL BE BACK.

662
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,520
I WILL BE PUTTING EVERY LAST

663
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,189
OUNCE OF MY SOUL INTO

664
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:14,898
REDEMPTION.

665
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:15,691
I HOPE TO SEE ALL OF YOU COMING

666
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,150
THROUGH THERE, AND I'LL MAKE YOU

667
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,319
A NICE FISH, AND I'LL SEND YOU

668
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:23,865
ON YOUR WAY.

669
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,075
Jeff: SO, BEFORE WE GET TO

670
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,369
THE VOTE, ONE PRESSING

671
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,495
QUESTION-- JIM, YOU HAVE THE

672
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,204
IMMUNITY NECKLACE.

673
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,832
AS YOU KNOW, YOU CAN ASSIGN IT

674
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,667
TO SOMEBODY ELSE, IF YOU WANT

675
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,209
TO.

676
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:37,504
OR KEEP IT FOR YOURSELF.

677
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:41,425
I'M GOING TO KEEP IT TONIGHT.

678
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,176
Jeff: YOU CANNOT VOTE FOR

679
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:43,844
JIM.

680
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:44,845
EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.

681
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:55,564
WHITNEY, YOU'RE UP.

682
00:21:55,647 --> 00:22:06,408
I JUST REALLY DON'T LIKE YOU.

683
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:13,165
I JUST REALLY DON'T LIKE YOU.

684
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,125
YOU HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET

686
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:17,919
THINK IT'S THAT INAPPROPRIATE

687
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:22,591
FOR ME TO BE VOTING FOR YOU.

688
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,592
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

689
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:34,394

00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:42,611

00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,278
DO SO.

ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE

695
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:45,781
DECISION IS FINAL.

696
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:46,740

722
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:38,959
Jeff: OZZY, ONCE AGAIN, THE

723
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,168
TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,462
AND ONCE AGAIN, YOU WILL HAVE A

725
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,506
CHANCE TO GET BACK IN THIS GAME.

726
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,466
YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT.

727
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,008
Jeff: GRAB YOUR TORCH.

728
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,802
HEAD TO REDEMPTION.

729
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:52,681
GOOD LUCK.

730
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:57,519
WELL, FOR 22 DAYS, THIS GAME HAS

731
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,687
BEEN UNPREDICTABLE.

732
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,730
FOR WHITNEY, DAWN, AND JIM, YOU

733
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,566
JUST GOTTA HOPE IT STAYS THAT

734
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:03,066
WAY.

735
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:03,650
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

736
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,026
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

737
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,362
GOOD NIGHT.

738
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:10,365
I PLAYED A REALLY HARD, HARD

739
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,032
GAME.

740
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,409
I PLAYED AND MADE BIG MOVES.

741
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,743
AND I'M PRETTY MUCH PROUD OF

742
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:14,661
WHAT I DID.

743
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:15,620
I TOOK BIG RISKS.

744
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,373
THEY DIDN'T WORK OUT IN MY

745
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,124
FAVOR.

746
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:21,209
BUT YOU GOTTA TAKE BIG RISKS TO

747
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,669
GET BIG REWARD AND I'M READY TO

00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:23,712
DO REALLY WELL AT REDEMPTION.

00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,423
DUDE.

750
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,757
TOTALLY.

751
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:28,717
BY COCHRAN, RIGHT?

752
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,426
OF COURSE.

753
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,845
WHEN PEOPLE COME THROUGH, I'M

754
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:32,888
GOING TO TREAT THEM REALLY NICE,

755
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:33,180
AND THEN I'M GOING TO SEND THEM

756
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,598
PACKING.

757
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,359
I JUST GOT TO REDEMPTION LAST

758
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,027
NIGHT.

759
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,069
THIS IS MY FIRST CHANCE JUST

760
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:48,904
TOOK EXPLORE THE REEF.

761
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,239
AND THE REEF OUT HERE IS

762
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,576
MAGNIFICENT.

763
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,785
WHERE THE REEF DROPS OFF, IT

764
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:59,289
DROPS OFF PROBABLY A SOLID 20 TO

765
00:24:59,372 --> 00:24:59,998
30 FEET.

766
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,083
AND THEN FROM THERE IT JUST GOES

767
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:02,792
STRAIGHT DOWN.

768
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,085
THE TIDE RIPS OUT REALLY HARD

769
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,086
AND THERE ARE BIG WAVES BUT

770
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,297
THAT'S WHERE YOU GET BIG FISH

771
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,093
HANGING OUT.

772
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:12,761
HA-HA!

773
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:13,762
YES!

774
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,764
BIGGEST FISH I'VE EVER CAUGHT.

775
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,224
WE'RE GOING TO BE EATING WELL

776
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:17,933
TONIGHT.

777
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:18,475
WE'RE GOING TO BE EATING WELL

778
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:19,142
RIGHT NOW AND TONIGHT.

779
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:22,103
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE-- IT'S GOT

780
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,773
TO BE, LIKE, 15 POUNDS.

781
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:29,778
SO MUCH MEAT.

782
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,489
SUSHIMI ON "SURVIVOR."

783
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:33,490
ME, TOO.

784
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:34,574
I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE.

785
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:35,283
I WISH I WAS IN THE GAME, BUT

786
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,785
I'M JUST AS EXCITED TO BE HERE.

787
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,455
I WONDER WHAT THEY'RE EATING

788
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:43,583
TODAY?

789
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:57,597
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

790
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,765

00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,934

YEAH.

793
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:02,811
Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,

794
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:06,982
JIM, I WILL TAKE IT BACK.

795
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,650
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

796
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,026
FOR GRABS.

797
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,486
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE

798
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:14,155
GOING TO STAND ON A VERY NARROW

799
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,199
BEAM WHILE BALANCING A BALL ON A

800
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,117
WOODEN BOW.

801
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,952
AT A CERTAIN POINT, YOU'LL MOVE

802
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,120
EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE BEAM,

803
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,204
MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT.

804
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,498
IF AT ANY POINT THE BALL DROPS

805
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:24,958
OR YOU FALL OFF THE BEAM, YOU'RE

806
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,167
OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

807
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,836
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS

808
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,505
IMMUNITY AND IS SAFE AT

809
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:31,881
TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL.

00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:32,799
LOSERS, SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED

811
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,842
OUT AND SENT TO REDEMPTION

812
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:34,509
ISLAND.

813
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:35,802
THERE IS A TWIST TO TODAY'S

814
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:36,469
CHALLENGE.

815
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:40,348
IF YOU ARE SO CONFIDENT THAT

816
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,851
YOUR ONE IN 10 SPOT IN THIS GAME

817
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,644
FOR $1 MILLION IS SECURE THAT

818
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,021
YOU DON'T NEED IMMUNITY TONIGHT

819
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,355
YOU CAN SIT THIS CHALLENGE OUT

820
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:51,860
AND INSTEAD YOU CAN FEAST.

821
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:52,986
OH, MY GOD!

822
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,738
OH!

823
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,282
Jeff: ONE OF THE BIGGEST

824
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,325
CRAVINGS WHEN YOU'RE OUT HERE

825
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:58,992
ARE SWEETS.

826
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,036
YOU HAVE PASTRIES AND ICED

827
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:01,703
COFFEE.

828
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,998
THIS IS A CHANCE TO SATISFY THAT

829
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:05,707
CRAVING.

830
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,833
I GOTTA PICK UP ON THE OBVIOUS.

831
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:09,711
EVERYBODY IS CELEBRATING EXCEPT

832
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:10,378
COACH.

833
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:10,962
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU JUST GOT THE

834
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,214
WORST NEWS OF YOUR LIFE.

835
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:18,720

Jeff: COMPETE.

838
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,098
THERE ARE SEVEN PEOPLE WHO

839
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,558
DON'T NEED TO COMPETE.

840
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,226
Jeff: LET ME DO THE OBVIOUS

841
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:25,935
MATH.

842
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,562

COCHRAN ARE THINKING THEY MAY

846
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:32,776
NOT NEED IT.

847
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,778
THE THING ISRY WITH A FAMILY

848
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:38,073
AND WE STICK TOGETHER AND WE'RE

849
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:38,907

JIM, DAWN, AND WHITNEY.

00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:44,788
NOT SURPRISING.

854
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,873
Jeff: UPOLU TRIBE AND

00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,750

00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:12,065
PUT YOUR BALL IN YOUR BOW.

868
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:12,941
IF YOUR BALL FALLS OFF OR YOU

869
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,777
FALL OFF, YOU ARE OUT OF THIS

870
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,486

JIM, DROPS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

899
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:17,297

00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:43,198
TRIBE BUT IT'S NOT THAT WAY.

00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,533
EAT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.

921
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,868
DAWN HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE.

00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,084
FIVE MORE SECONDS LEFT IN THIS

930
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,837
ROUND AND YOU WILL STEP DOWN.

931
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,882
FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

937
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,724
THIS IS GOING TO INCREASE THE

938
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:11,684
DIFFICULTY BECAUSE IT IS VERY

939
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:12,352
NARROW.

940
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,186
NOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

941
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:14,354
REALLY BALANCE WHILE BALANCING

942
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,897
THE BALL.

943
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:21,236
PLACE YOUR BALL BACK ON YOUR BO

944
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:21,945
BOW.

945
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:24,405
FIND SOME PLACE THAT FEELS LIKE

946
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,073
CENTER.

947
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,200
THIS CHALLENGE IS BACK ON.

948
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,743
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REALLY

949
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:29,577
CONCENTRATE NOW.

950
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,454
VERY LITTLE ROOM FOR ERROR HERE.

951
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,915
THE SLIGHTEST SHIFT IN YOUR

952
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:34,249
BALANCE WILL KNOCK YOU OFF OF

953
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,417
THIS BEAM.

954
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:40,213
YOU GIRLS ARE DOING GOOD.

955
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,632
Jeff: THE EATING HAS SLOWED

956
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:43,258
DOWN AT THE TABLE.

957
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,217
I THINK I'M OUT.

958
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:49,722
Jeff: LOTS OF FULL BELLIES.

959
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:50,431
THE WINNER OF THIS IS GUARANTEED

960
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:54,269
A ONE IN NINE SHOT AT THE MONEY.

961
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,061
24 DAYS, YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO

962
00:30:55,144 --> 00:31:01,067
TO REDEMPTION ISLAND RIGHT NOW.

963
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,277
STAY STRONG.

964
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,528
Jeff: DAWN WITH A WOBBLE,

965
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,946
CAN SHE RECOVER?

966
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:05,780
STAY STRONG.

967
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:06,948
Jeff: AMAZING JOB!

968
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:07,949
OH, YES!

969
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,784
AWESOME, AWESOME RECOVERY.

970
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:10,326
SO, AWESOME!

971
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,120
YOU CAN TELL WHO BRANDON

972
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:22,964
LIKES MORE.

973
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:31,973
LIKES MORE.

974
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,099
Jeff: DAWN COULDN'T HANG ON

975
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:33,641
ANYMORE.

976
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,269
WHITNEY WINS IMMUNITY.

977
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,313
IS SAFE AT NIGHT'S TRIBAL

978
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:38,896
COUNCIL.

979
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,647
WHITNEY, COME ON OVER.

980
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,148
GOOD JOB, WHITT.

981
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:44,068
GOOD JOB, WHITNEY!

982
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:44,444
( APPLAUSE )

983
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,278
WAY TO GO.

984
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,779
YOU DID IT.

985
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,615
Jeff: WHITNEY IS SAFE AT

986
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,324
TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL.

987
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,700
YOU CANNOT VOTE HER OUT OF THIS

988
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:51,409
GAME.

989
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,660
EVERYBODY ELSE IS VULNERABLE.

990
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,119
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

991
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:53,745
CAMP.

992
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,496
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

993
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,664
FINISH WHAT'S IN YOUR MOUTH AND

994
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:57,206
HEAD OUT.

995
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,124
PERSONALLY, I DEPARTMENT

996
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,335
REALLY LIKE THE WAY WE TREATED

997
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,002
DAWN AT THE CHALLENGE.

998
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,170
I THOUGHT WE WERE A LITTLE TOO

999
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,006
INCLUSIVE WITH HER.

1000
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:05,423
I WANT TO NIP THIS IN THE BUD AS

1001
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,550
SOON AS I CAN.

1002
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:16,184
HEY, BRO!

1003
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:16,768
DRAGON SLAYER.

1004
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,187
LOOK AT THIS GUY, MAN.

1005
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,188
WHAT IS UP?

1006
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:20,772
YEAH!

1007
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:24,859
COCHRAN, WHAT IS UP, MAN?

1008
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:27,904
WE ARE SEEING THIS SIDE OF YOU,

1009
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:28,363
BABY

1010
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:28,655
( APPLAUSE ).

1011
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:29,322
YEAH!

1012
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:30,698
COCHRAN RIGHT NOW IS PLAYING

1013
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,408
THE MOST BRILLIANT THIRD-PLACE

1014
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,035
GAME IN "SURVIVOR" HISTORY.

1015
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,495
EVERY ONE OF THOSE NINE PEOPLE

1016
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:36,829
WOULD LOVE TO TAKE COCHRAN TO

1017
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:37,413
THE END.

1018
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,082
COCHRAN, YOU ARE THE MAN,

1019
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:39,791
BABY!

1020
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:40,500
I THINK HE LOOKS LIKE A STUD.

1021
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,211
NOW YOU'RE FULLY INCORPORATED

1022
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:43,878
INTO OUR TRIBE.

1023
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:46,381
COCHRAN AIN'T GOING NOWHERE.

1024
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,882
BUT IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD FOR

1025
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:48,549
ME.

1026
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,217
I AM 100% GOING TO REDEMPTION

1027
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:49,926
ISLAND.

1028
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,428
UNLESS I MAKE SOME MOVES RIGHT

1029
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,554
NOW.

1030
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,556
SO HERE'S HOW I SEE IT.

1031
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,392
WE'VE GOT COACH WITH COCHRAN,

1032
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,726
EDNA, AND BRANDON UNDERNEATH

1033
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,520
THEM, AND RICK WHO HAS GIVEN HIS

1034
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:01,896
WORD TO COACH, AND RICK IS THE

1035
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:03,022
ONLY GUY WHO PROBABLY WOULD

1036
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,524
NEVER GO BACK ON HIS WORD.

1037
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,234
WE HAVE YOU TWO, THE ONLY TWO

1038
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,236
PEOPLE WHO AREN'T DRINKING THE

1039
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,405
COOL AID AND IN THE CULT, AND WE

1040
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,782
HAVE DAWN, WHITT ME, AND ME OVER

1041
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:13,491
HERE.

1042
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,451
WE HAVE THE FIVE OF US VOTING

1043
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,786
EDNA-- THIS WOULD BE MY PLAN.

1044
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,413
FIVE OF US VOTING EDNA--

1045
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,247
JIM APPROACHED ME AND SOPHIE

1046
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,916
AND TOLD US, LISTEN, I HAVE A

1047
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:23,292
PLAN, GET RID OF EDNA.

1048
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,462
AND HE J.D. DREW UP SOMETHING

1049
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,923
THAT WAS PRETTY CREATIVE AND

1050
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:29,674
OUTSIDE THE BOX, SO TO SPEAK.

1051
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,343
I NEED TO ENTERTAIN JIM'S OFFER

1052
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,429
BECAUSE I HAVE A MUCH BETTER

1053
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,472
PLAN THAN ANYTHING HE COULD

1054
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,098
OFFER ME RIGHT NOW.

1055
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,891
I KIND OF LIKE THE BUCKET.

1056
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:39,642
YEAH, RIGHT.

1057
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,103
I THINK DAWN, EVEN THOUGH SHE

1058
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,396
DOESN'T SEEM AS OVERTLY

1059
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:46,733
DANGEROUS AS JIM IS, IS MAYBE

1060
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,067
MORE DANGEROUS THAN HIM IN A LOT

1061
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,986
OF WAYS BECAUSE SHE'S MORE

1062
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,612
LIKABLE, AND SHE'S SOMEBODY

1063
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,114
THAT'S SLOWLY BUT SURELY EKING

1064
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:56,576
HER WAY INTO OUR ALLIANCE.

1065
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,453
OKAY, GOT IT?

1066
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,287
YEAH N-

1067
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,455
ONE BLUE SHIRT.

1068
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,914
MINUS COCONUT.

1069
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:02,623
I'VE ALWAYS SEEN MYSELF AS A

1070
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,292
PERSON THAT CAN BRING TOGETHER

1071
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,334
DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEOPLE.

1072
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,628
SO FOR ME, IT ALMOST COULDN'T BE

1073
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,296
BETTER AT THIS STAGE TO BE THAT

1074
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,465
KIND OF PERSON BECAUSE I'M

1075
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,924
PROBABLY A GOOD PERSON TO TRY TO

1076
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,010
GET MYSELF IN WITH THE FORMER

1077
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,970
UPOLU TRIBE MEMBERS AND SEE IF

1078
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:16,679
THERE'S SOME WIGGLE ROOM THERE.

1079
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,765
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WHETHER I

1080
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:27,315
CAN HANG ON LONG ENOUGH.

1081
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,650
JIM, I CAN BEAT JIM IN A LOT OF

1082
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:37,158
THOSE TYPE CHALLENGES.

1083
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,826
WE SHOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THIS.

1084
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,869
ALBERT, HE'S GETTING NERVOUS.

1085
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,162
HE'S THINKING A LOT RIGHT NOW

1086
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,663
ABOUT SWITCHING UP THE GAME AND

1087
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,664
I THINK THOSE ARE IMPORTANT

1088
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:48,044
THINGS TO THINK ABOUT IN GENERAL

1089
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,045
"SURVIVOR" STRAIT SNEE.

1090
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,922
BUT I'D LIKE TO STAY PRETTY

1091
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,006
RIDGE WIDE THE PLAN.

1092
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:53,508
I'D RATHER GET RID OF JIM.

1093
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:58,221
HEY, MAN.

1094
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,180
JUST BECAUSE THERE'S A GREATER

1095
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,348
CHANCE OF PEOPLE GRAVITATING

1096
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:06,646
TOWARDS DAWN.

1097
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,689
WE'RE IN THE JUNGLE HERE.

1098
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,191
SO I THINK AN ANALOGY TO THE

1099
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,401
ANIMAL KINGDOM WOULD BE SUFFICE

1100
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,110
AT THIS MOMENT.

1101
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,238
YOU HAVE JIM BOW WHO IS LIKE A

1102
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,698
RHINOCEROS THAT JUST COMES

1103
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:18,699
CHARGING IN STRAIGHT TOWARDS

1104
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,450
YOU.

1105
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,701
AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMEBODY LIKE

1106
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,410
DAWN.

1107
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,537
SHE'S THE SERPENT ON THE SNAKE.

1108
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,538
THEY COME SNEAKING THROUGH THE

1109
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,205
GRASS.

1110
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,498
I HAVE TO MAKE SURE I HAVE MY

1111
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,374
STUFF JUST IN CASE.

1112
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,416
TODAY AT THE CHALLENGE, DAWN

1113
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,459
WAS GETTING MOST CHEERS.

1114
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,712
PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO GENUINELY

1115
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,048
LIKE DAWN SO I SEE DAWN AS A

1116
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,092
SNAKE AND JIM A RHINOCEROS.

1117
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,218
THEY CAN BOTH KILL YOU BUT

1118
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,345
HOPEFULLY WE'LL SEND THE RIGHT

1119
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:52,441
PERSON HOME TONIGHT.

1120
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:56,237
Jeff: SO, COACH, GIVEN

1121
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,406
TODAY'S CHALLENGE AND THE FACT

1122
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,740
THAT EVERYBODY SAT OUT, EXCEPT

1123
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:00,449
FOR DAWN, JIM, AND WHITNEY, IS

1124
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:03,202
IT FAIR TO ASSUME THAT SINCE

1125
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,495
WHITNEY HAS IMMUNITY IT IS DAWN

1126
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,621
OR JIM GOING HOME TONIGHT?

1127
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,415
YES, ABSOLUTELY.

1128
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,542
Jeff: SOPHIE, IS IT FAIR TO

1129
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,252
SAY THAT IF YOU HAD TO PICK ONE,

1130
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,421
THAT JIM IS MAYBE MORE OF A

1131
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,422
THREAT IN CHALLENGES THAN DAWN?

1132
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,425
I THINK THEY BOTH HAVE THEIR

1133
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,092
NICHES.

1134
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:19,468
DAWN HAS SHOWN HERSELF TO BE

1135
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,887
REALLY STRONG BUT IF I WAS

1136
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,430
CHOOSING A ROSTER, I WOULD

1137
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,432
CHOOSE JIM EVERY TIME.

1138
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,601
Jeff: ALBERT, IF YOU HAD TO

1139
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,060
CHOOSE, WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY

1140
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,437
THAT DAWN MAY BE THE MORE

1141
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,104
LIKABLE PERSON?

1142
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:31,647
YEAH, I THINK IT'S VERY FAIR

1143
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:32,440
TO SAY DAWN IS THE MORE LIKABLE,

1144
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,151
AND SHE'S ALSO A TOUGH COOK

1145
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:35,860
NECHALLENGES.

1146
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:36,569
I MEAN, SHE'S PROVEN THAT SHE

1147
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:37,945
MIGHT BE THE STRONGEST FEMALE

1148
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,280
PLAYER ON THE SEASON.

1149
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,490
SO, YOU KNOW, THAT WITHIN ITSELF

1150
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,326
BEARAISE PRETTY IMPOSING

1151
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:43,826
PRESENCE.

1152
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,244
Jeff: DAWN, FOR AS

1153
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,746
FRUSTRATING AS IT IS TO YOU AND

1154
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:49,123
JIM AND WHITNEY, IS IT FAIR TO

1155
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:50,791
SAY THIS IS WHAT THIS TRIBE

1156
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:51,459
SHOULD DO?

1157
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,627
NO, IT'S WHAT WE WOULD HAVE

1158
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,921
DONE AS SAVAII, ALSO.

1159
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:55,922
ALTHOUGH, I DON'T THINK I WOULD

1160
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:58,132
HAVE EATEN THE FOOT TODAY TO BE

1161
00:36:58,215 --> 00:36:58,799
HONEST.

1162
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,800
I REALLY DID SEE THIS AS ONE

1163
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,302
TRIBE SO THAT WAS HARD FOR ME TO

1164
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,303
WATCH THEM EAT.

1165
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:02,970
Jeff: BRANDON?

1166
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,639
I LOVE YOU, DAWN, BUT YOU

1167
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,850
TOLD US YOU WOULD WANT TO STAY

1168
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,352
UP THERE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE SO

1169
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:09,894
WE COULD EAT.

1170
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,103
FOR SURE, FOR SURE.

1171
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,813
YOU JUST CONTRADICTED WHAT

1172
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:13,439
YOU SAID.

1173
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:13,814
NO, I'M JUST SAYING IT WAS

1174
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:14,565
HARD FOR ME.

1175
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,275
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

1176
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,193
I DON'T BUY IT.

1177
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:21,322
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY SAVAII TRIBE,

1178
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,115
EXCLUDING COCHRAN, IS GOING TO

1179
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,700
BE PICKED OFF JUST AS EXACTLY AS

1180
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:25,660
THEY THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE

1181
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,535
PICKED OFF.

1182
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,411
WE'RE TRYING TO BE NICE ABOUT

1183
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,829
IT, BUT SOMETIMES IT JUST GETS

1184
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:29,705
ON YOUR NERVES.

1185
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:30,998
I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND

1186
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,708
WHAT YOU WERE SAYING THEY HAD

1187
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:33,084
SAID.

1188
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:33,626
I'M SORRY.

1189
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:36,253
I THINK IT'S JUST A

1190
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:36,796
MISCOMMUNICATION.

1191
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:37,505
I DON'T THINK IT IS.

1192
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,673
JUST LIKE SHE SAID THEY WOULD

1193
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,174
HAVE DONE THE SAME THING WITH US

1194
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:40,633
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT

1195
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:41,342
MORE RUTHLESS.

1196
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,678
NO, BRANDON, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

1197
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,470
THEY'RE BEING NICE BECAUSE

1198
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:45,179
THEY HAVE TO.

1199
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:46,847
IT WAS LIKE I'M SO EXCITED THAT

1200
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,599
YOU GUYS GOT TO EAT.

1201
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,101
I WAS HAPPY YOU GOT TO.

1202
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,686
DISMEN I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY

1203
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:52,269
ATE.

1204
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,188
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

1205
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:55,314
THAT DOESN'T ADD UP TO ME,

1206
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,983
EITHER YOU ARE OKAY THAT WE

1207
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:57,525
ATE-- DO YOU GET WHAT YOU'RE

1208
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,192
SAYING.

1209
00:37:58,275 --> 00:37:59,944
BUT I WAS JUST SAYING IT WAS

1210
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:00,528
HARD FOR ME.

1211
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:01,153
THAT'S IT.

1212
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:01,696
I'M SORRY.

1213
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:02,863
LOOK AT MY.

1214
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,532
BECAUSE I APOLOGIZE IF I'VE

1215
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,032
OFFENDED YOU.

1216
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,367
I FORGIVE YOU, I DO.

1217
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,201
I MEAN IT.

1218
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:07,868
I'VE BEEN GENUINE AND I REALLY

1219
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,204
DO WANT TO GET TO KNOW YOU GITES

1220
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,790
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE A

1221
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:13,833
MAJORITY AND THAT'S THE WAY THE

1222
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:14,542
GAME GOES.

1223
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,584
I CAN PROMISE YOU, JEFF, NONE

1224
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:18,212
OF US ARE GOING TO STOP UNTIL

1225
00:38:18,295 --> 00:38:21,549
THAT WHOLE SAVAII TRIBE IS

1226
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,216
COMPLETELY...

1227
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:24,343
Jeff: WHITNEY WHAT, DO YOU

1228
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,052
MAKE OF ALL THIS, BECAUSE YOU'RE

1229
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,721
SAFE TONIGHT BUT TOMORROW YOU

1230
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,348
BECOME POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE

1231
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:29,724
AGAIN.

1232
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:30,391
OH, TOTALLY.

1233
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,393
WILL FEEL LIKE WE DEFINITELY

1234
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,395
HAVE BEEN VILIFIED BUT YET I

1235
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,522
FEEL LIKE I'VE PLAYED THIS GAME

1236
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:37,565
JUST AS HONESTLY AS THEY HAVE.

1237
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:41,402
AND I GET WHAT DAWN WAS SAYING.

1238
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,611
IT WAS JUST HARD BECAUSE WE'RE

1239
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:43,738
HUNGRY, TOO, BUT WE HAVE TO

1240
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,740
FIGHT FOR OUR LIVES, AND YOU ALL

1241
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,616
DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

1242
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,036
Jeff: WHAT HAS MADE YOU

1243
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:50,494
EMOTIONAL?

1244
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:51,078
SUDDENLY YOU'RE--

1245
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,621
I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN

1246
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,998
COMPLETELY VILIFIED, AND THEY--

1247
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:57,543
THEY DON'T EVEN ACCEPT AS, LIKE,

1248
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,712
REAL PEOPLE.

1249
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:02,089
WE WERE PAINTED AS BULLIES.

1250
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,424
I NEVER ONCE WAS A BULLY.

1251
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,425
IT'S HARD TO TAKE.

1252
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:12,224
I'M NOT A BAD PERSON.

1253
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,142
Jeff: BRANDON, IS IT HARD

1254
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:17,271
FOR YOU TO SEE WHITNEY CRYING?

1255
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:17,980
ABSOLUTELY.

1256
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,940
I DON'T WANT TO SEE WHITNEY CRY.

1257
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,567
I HAVE NOTHING PERSONAL AGAINST

1258
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,777
ANYBODY BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE

1259
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,155
WERE EXCLUDED UNTIL WE GOT

1260
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:26,781
POWER.

1261
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:27,948
THEN WE WERE THE VILLAINS.

1262
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,117
I MEAN, I DON'T MEAN TO MAKE YOU

1263
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,953
CRY, BUT IT'S-- IT'S-- IT'S A

1264
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:36,457
NO-BRAINER FOR ME.

1265
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:36,874
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET

1266
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:37,625
TO THE VOTE.

1267
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,794
WHITNEY, YOU HAVE IMMUNITY.

1268
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:40,586
I DON'T HAVE TO ASK.

1269
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,004
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT GIVING IT UP.

1270
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,255
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1271
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:53,307
RICK, YOU'RE UP.

1272
00:39:53,390 --> 00:40:18,499
RICK, YOU'RE UP.

1273
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:22,628
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1274
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:30,511
VOTES.

1275
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,013
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN

1276
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:33,848
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO

1277
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,015
PLAY IT NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO

1278
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,684
DO SO.

1279
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,686
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,

1280
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:39,854
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1281
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,147
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1282
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,648

1283
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:43,190
IMMEDIATELY.

BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE AS GOOD

1354
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:53,821
OF A SHOT AS I HAD THREE DAYS

00:42:54,571 --> 00:42:55,781
