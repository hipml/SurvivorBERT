00:29:57,413 --> 00:30:00,073
<i>In high school, I was
a three-sport varsity athlete.</i>

673
00:30:00,172 --> 00:30:03,002
<i>My dream was to play
collegiate lacrosse,</i>

674
00:30:03,103 --> 00:30:06,073
<i>and I earned myself a Division I
scholarship to play in college.</i>

675
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:08,902
But the summer
following my freshman year,

676
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,340
I was involved
in a moped accident.

677
00:30:12,724 --> 00:30:14,144
<i>I lost my leg.</i>

678
00:30:14,241 --> 00:30:16,831
<i>I definitely thought
my life was over.</i>

679
00:30:16,931 --> 00:30:19,311
I didn't think that I was
gonna be able to overcome it,

680
00:30:19,413 --> 00:30:22,413
<i>but I didn't want
to let that single moment</i>

681
00:30:22,517 --> 00:30:25,067
define the rest of my life.

682
00:30:25,172 --> 00:30:27,382
<i>The process
of getting back on the field</i>

683
00:30:27,482 --> 00:30:29,972
<i>was very challenging for me,</i>

684
00:30:30,068 --> 00:30:32,898
<i>but by the time
my junior year rolled around,</i>

685
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,320
<i>I was the first
above-knee amputee</i>

686
00:30:34,413 --> 00:30:36,623
<i>to ever play
collegiate lacrosse.</i>

687
00:30:36,724 --> 00:30:38,244
<i>And then about
a year and a half later,</i>

688
00:30:38,344 --> 00:30:41,624
<i>I qualified for my first
Paralympic Games in Tokyo.</i>

689
00:30:41,724 --> 00:30:43,214
<i>And there I placed
sixth in the world,</i>

690
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,380
<i>and I set a new U.S. record
for the 100 meter.</i>

691
00:30:46,482 --> 00:30:48,412
<i>I am absolutely here to prove</i>

692
00:30:48,517 --> 00:30:49,992
<i>that anybody can play
the game of</i> Survivor,

693
00:30:50,034 --> 00:30:53,414
<i>and I'm willing to do
whatever it takes. So,</i>

694
00:30:53,517 --> 00:30:54,716
I want to play
this freaking game.

695
00:30:54,758 --> 00:30:56,158
Like, I want
to stop playing scared.

696
00:30:57,068 --> 00:31:00,068
The last Tribal Council didn't
go the way I expected it to go.

697
00:31:00,172 --> 00:31:02,482
- Oh, no. Really?
- JAMES: Really? Oh.
- Yeah.

698
00:31:02,586 --> 00:31:06,966
If you guys throw me a bone,
I promise you, come merge,

699
00:31:07,068 --> 00:31:09,548
I'm, like, willing to look you
guys in the face right now

700
00:31:09,655 --> 00:31:12,235
- and do a three.
- That'd be awesome.

701
00:31:12,344 --> 00:31:13,864
<i>NOELLE:
I'm being very open to them</i>

702
00:31:13,965 --> 00:31:15,785
and telling them what happened
at last Tribal Council, how

703
00:31:15,827 --> 00:31:17,307
<i>I was at the bottom
of the votes.</i>

704
00:31:17,413 --> 00:31:19,763
<i>I just kept trying to,
like, do whatever I could</i>

705
00:31:19,862 --> 00:31:21,785
<i>to kind of say, "I feel
really uncomfortable tonight."</i>

706
00:31:21,827 --> 00:31:25,097
<i>So having an advantage
in my pocket, it would be huge.</i>

707
00:31:25,206 --> 00:31:27,516
All right, James, what we got?

708
00:31:43,793 --> 00:31:45,863
"Those who choose Risk
will draw a package

709
00:31:45,965 --> 00:31:47,337
"from the appropriately-numbered
bag.

710
00:31:47,379 --> 00:31:49,519
You'll wait to open
until you are back at camp."

711
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,340
I'm-I'm down to...

712
00:31:51,448 --> 00:31:53,408
- I-I can protect.
- I'd like to keep my vote.

713
00:31:53,517 --> 00:31:54,578
- NOELLE: Yeah.
- And it sounds like you need it.

714
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,030
You guys sure?

715
00:31:56,137 --> 00:31:57,613
- Yes.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Aw, thank you, guys.

716
00:31:57,655 --> 00:31:59,305
OWEN:
You need it more than we do.

717
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,520
You guys are amazing.

718
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,233
- You got me.
- That's how you build trust,

719
00:32:05,275 --> 00:32:06,406
- like, literally, you know.
- Loyalty.

720
00:32:06,448 --> 00:32:07,544
I'm looking you guys
in the face.

721
00:32:07,586 --> 00:32:09,206
Loyalty.
I really appreciate that.

722
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,900
<i>OWEN:
Noelle's made it
pretty clear to us</i>

723
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,620
<i>that she is on the bottom,
and she needs this advantage.</i>

724
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:16,694
So, I decide, James decides
let's let Noelle be

725
00:32:16,793 --> 00:32:18,647
<i>the only person
who risks and get the advantage.</i>

726
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:19,854
I want to get those big players

727
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,616
out for you guys
before the merge.

728
00:32:21,724 --> 00:32:23,214
<i>JAMES:
She said she was going to try</i>

729
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,790
<i>to take a big shot, so now,</i>

730
00:32:24,896 --> 00:32:25,992
<i>I'm hoping that Noelle is going</i>

731
00:32:26,034 --> 00:32:27,314
to take this advantage

732
00:32:27,413 --> 00:32:28,889
and take out a big threat
on the tribe.

733
00:32:28,931 --> 00:32:30,661
I love this vibe. Let's go.

734
00:32:37,379 --> 00:32:39,999
Oh. It's gonna be a long night.

735
00:32:40,103 --> 00:32:42,213
- Really.
- Long night again. Yeah.

736
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,371
<i>DWIGHT:
The biggest concern of mine
going to Tribal is Jesse.</i>

737
00:32:44,413 --> 00:32:45,623
<i>He's burned me once.</i>

738
00:32:45,724 --> 00:32:47,004
<i>That first vote,</i>

739
00:32:47,103 --> 00:32:48,623
he did not go the way I thought

740
00:32:48,724 --> 00:32:50,604
it was going to go,
and that is solely on Jesse.

741
00:32:52,655 --> 00:32:55,585
<i>So going into this one, part
of me is also concerned that</i>

742
00:32:55,689 --> 00:32:58,309
<i>he could easily vote with the
same voting block of three of</i>

743
00:32:58,413 --> 00:33:00,483
<i>Cody, Nneka and Jesse, and vote</i>

744
00:33:00,586 --> 00:33:02,686
<i>myself or Noelle
out of this game.</i>

745
00:33:02,793 --> 00:33:05,553
<i>So, in a sense, what happens on
Noelle's journey will determine</i>

746
00:33:05,655 --> 00:33:07,375
what happens at Tribal Council.

747
00:33:07,482 --> 00:33:10,242
I mean, since we're going
to Tribal Council tonight,

748
00:33:10,344 --> 00:33:12,904
my thing was, like, I didn't
want to risk it and then

749
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,613
not have a vote tonight.
I mean, you can literally

750
00:33:14,655 --> 00:33:16,925
search my bag.
I swear to God,

751
00:33:17,034 --> 00:33:20,214
I just wanted to play it safe.

752
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,900
<i>So, I lie to everybody,
and, you know,</i>

753
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
but I'm thinking in the back
of my head, "Yes."

754
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,992
Like, my inner <i>Survivor</i> fan
would love this right now.

755
00:33:27,034 --> 00:33:28,440
Like, she's not
giving them anything.

756
00:33:28,482 --> 00:33:31,032
So, yeah, you guys can follow me
around all you want.

757
00:33:31,137 --> 00:33:33,447
I promise you
I don't have anything.

758
00:33:34,448 --> 00:33:36,898
<i>I think they bought it.
I hope they bought it. So now,</i>

759
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,830
<i>I have work to do.
I have to start</i>

760
00:33:38,931 --> 00:33:40,785
solidifying my spot
so that I can be safe tonight.

761
00:33:40,827 --> 00:33:42,277
All right, so...

762
00:33:42,379 --> 00:33:44,479
<i>I know typically,
like,</i> Survivor <i>players...</i>

763
00:33:44,586 --> 00:33:46,826
You do not tell anybody
you have an advantage.

764
00:33:48,034 --> 00:33:50,764
<i>But I just want to keep this
between Dwight and myself</i>

765
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,172
because I feel like I have
the strongest bond with him.

766
00:33:53,275 --> 00:33:54,685
- This is for us.
- I...

767
00:33:54,793 --> 00:33:56,413
<i>This might be a first
on</i> Survivor,

768
00:33:56,517 --> 00:33:59,167
but, hey,
I have a great hidden spot

769
00:33:59,275 --> 00:34:00,995
right inside my foot shell.

770
00:34:03,724 --> 00:34:06,414
This type of advantage
is insanely important.

771
00:34:13,413 --> 00:34:15,268
- This is perfect
that we have this.
- That is just us.

772
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:17,280
<i>NOELLE:
This advantage to steal a vote</i>

773
00:34:17,379 --> 00:34:19,939
<i>and to cast an extra vote... this
could help me make a really big</i>

774
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,140
gameplay move.

775
00:34:22,172 --> 00:34:25,692
<i>At the last Tribal Council,
I felt burned by Jesse,</i>

776
00:34:25,793 --> 00:34:27,763
<i>and we're trying to gauge
where he's at right now.</i>

777
00:34:27,862 --> 00:34:32,482
<i>And if we feel even a little bit
untrustworthy towards him,</i>

778
00:34:32,586 --> 00:34:35,376
<i>then I can absolutely
steal his vote,</i>

779
00:34:35,482 --> 00:34:38,522
<i>and Dwight and I are controlling
this game at this point.</i>

780
00:34:39,586 --> 00:34:41,686
<i>I have a freaking lot
of game left,</i>

781
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:43,073
and I have a lot more leg jokes.

782
00:34:43,172 --> 00:34:44,475
I have a lot more
different things that I want

783
00:34:44,517 --> 00:34:46,027
to pull out of my sleeve. So,

784
00:34:46,137 --> 00:34:49,067
<i>I think the biggest thing
this Tribal's all about is just</i>

785
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:52,482
<i>reassuring that I'm gonna be
here when I wake up tomorrow.</i>

786
00:35:08,034 --> 00:35:11,144
♪ ♪

787
00:35:26,103 --> 00:35:28,833
All right, so let's start
with the challenge today.

788
00:35:28,931 --> 00:35:31,241
Nneka, Vesi was killing it,

789
00:35:31,344 --> 00:35:33,104
and you and Jesse
were killing it,

790
00:35:33,206 --> 00:35:35,826
and then,
the pieces just stopped moving.

791
00:35:35,931 --> 00:35:37,901
Yes, I still take, you know,

792
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,450
a big chunk of accountability
for that.

793
00:35:40,551 --> 00:35:43,141
But it was a team effort,
and we all wanted

794
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,281
to make sure we're a part of it.

795
00:35:45,379 --> 00:35:47,379
PROBST:
Jesse, what do you
think happened?

796
00:35:47,482 --> 00:35:49,842
I mean, I do jigsaw puzzles
at home with my kids, but, like,

797
00:35:49,896 --> 00:35:51,176
it is a different
setting, right?

798
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:53,165
Like, we've got people
yelling at us.

799
00:35:53,275 --> 00:35:55,095
There's you
yelling things at us.

800
00:35:55,206 --> 00:35:57,096
- [laughing]: You know?
- [laughter]

801
00:35:57,206 --> 00:35:59,406
And we're also, like, hungry and
starving. We're not operating

802
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,208
at our best out here, and so,

803
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,030
it just sort of slipped
through our fingers.

804
00:36:03,137 --> 00:36:05,717
So, Nneka, when you go back
to camp, Noelle's on a journey.

805
00:36:05,827 --> 00:36:07,547
What happens?

806
00:36:07,655 --> 00:36:10,235
Jeff, there was a lot
of heartbreak.

807
00:36:10,344 --> 00:36:12,554
You know, we lost out
on immunity, we lost out

808
00:36:12,655 --> 00:36:14,655
on a reward, but the worst part

809
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:17,208
of it was that we're gonna

810
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,660
lose out on another
tribe member.

811
00:36:20,758 --> 00:36:23,898
And coming into <i>Survivor,</i>
yes, I think

812
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,450
I understood
the physical part of it.

813
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:27,521
I understood
the mental part of it.

814
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,310
I did not understand
that you actually

815
00:36:29,413 --> 00:36:33,173
get to care about people
you met a few days ago

816
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:34,578
because they really
have been your family out here,

817
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,790
and you have to sit there
and make a decision

818
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:40,306
to say, hey, that's the end
of the road for one of 'em.

819
00:36:40,413 --> 00:36:42,593
It was a hard afternoon.

820
00:36:42,689 --> 00:36:44,789
PROBST:
Cody, can you relate
to what Nneka's saying?

821
00:36:44,896 --> 00:36:46,516
CODY:
Oh, undoubtedly. Uh,

822
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,233
We were doing the numbers
the other day. Seven days

823
00:36:48,275 --> 00:36:50,995
is what? Plus two...
What is seven times 24?

824
00:36:51,103 --> 00:36:52,003
200 some hours?

825
00:36:52,103 --> 00:36:54,593
- 168.
- That's a lot of

826
00:36:54,689 --> 00:36:56,479
unanswered hours with people.

827
00:36:56,586 --> 00:36:58,586
I mean, there's no
outside effects, whether it be

828
00:36:58,689 --> 00:37:00,164
children,
whether it be your loved ones,

829
00:37:00,206 --> 00:37:02,686
whether it be cell phones,
whether it be work. We are

830
00:37:02,793 --> 00:37:05,343
devoted to each other 100%
this whole time we're out here.

831
00:37:05,448 --> 00:37:08,028
So I feel
the same way Nneka does.

832
00:37:08,137 --> 00:37:10,687
But, you know,
there's a game to play.

833
00:37:10,793 --> 00:37:14,003
PROBST:
So, Dwight, that
leads to the question

834
00:37:14,103 --> 00:37:16,593
that I'm guessing
you were grappling with today,

835
00:37:16,689 --> 00:37:18,859
which is, which path do we take?

836
00:37:18,965 --> 00:37:20,889
Make this tribe as strong
as possible in challenges,

837
00:37:20,931 --> 00:37:23,341
or we're going
to be down to four,

838
00:37:23,448 --> 00:37:25,378
I got to hold on to my alliance?

839
00:37:25,482 --> 00:37:26,958
DWIGHT:
I think those are typically
the schools of thought

840
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,280
that are discussed.
Um, however, I don't think,

841
00:37:29,379 --> 00:37:31,029
like, we just decided
to follow one.

842
00:37:31,137 --> 00:37:34,137
We're trying to find what is the
right balance for each of us,

843
00:37:34,241 --> 00:37:36,001
and I think
we're gonna see in the vote

844
00:37:36,103 --> 00:37:38,003
what kind of path we chose.

845
00:37:38,103 --> 00:37:39,302
PROBST:
So, Noelle, you get back.

846
00:37:39,344 --> 00:37:41,174
Clock is ticking.

847
00:37:41,275 --> 00:37:42,544
- What do you do?
- I mean, it sucks

848
00:37:42,586 --> 00:37:43,716
because the time
that I was gone,

849
00:37:43,758 --> 00:37:45,061
everybody's having conversations,

850
00:37:45,103 --> 00:37:46,854
everyone's trying
to come up with a game plan,

851
00:37:46,896 --> 00:37:48,476
and I'm not there.
And I was already

852
00:37:48,586 --> 00:37:50,476
at the bottom
of the vote last time.

853
00:37:50,586 --> 00:37:52,716
You know,
coming into this game, Jeff,

854
00:37:52,827 --> 00:37:56,447
I have a lot to prove, but
I wanted to prove myself for me.

855
00:37:56,551 --> 00:37:58,711
I wanted to think, you know,
can I do these challenges?

856
00:37:58,793 --> 00:37:59,923
Like, you saw me
in the challenge.

857
00:37:59,965 --> 00:38:01,164
I'll freaking take my leg off.

858
00:38:01,206 --> 00:38:02,656
I'll do whatever it takes.

859
00:38:02,758 --> 00:38:04,898
I have a lot of heart and soul,
and I love this game,

860
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,790
and I want to continue playing.

861
00:38:06,896 --> 00:38:09,966
Jesse, it would be easy
for the four of you to say,

862
00:38:10,068 --> 00:38:12,588
"Look, Noelle's not here, and

863
00:38:12,689 --> 00:38:15,309
there's not enough time for her
to just work the relationships."

864
00:38:15,413 --> 00:38:18,523
JESSE:
Yeah, and not only was
she not there for conversations,

865
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,820
but she also went off
on this journey

866
00:38:19,862 --> 00:38:21,130
where, like,
who knows what she got.

867
00:38:21,172 --> 00:38:23,792
She could have got, like,
a Beware Advantage.

868
00:38:23,896 --> 00:38:26,516
She could have got an idol.
We have no idea.

869
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,030
So it could be
a legitimate approach

870
00:38:28,137 --> 00:38:29,897
to, you know,
who we vote out tonight.

871
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,590
PROBST:
So I'm just curious,
Dwight, how confident

872
00:38:32,689 --> 00:38:36,339
are you that the vote will go
the way you think it's going to?

873
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:39,338
- Re... Very confident.
- PROBST: How about you, Cody?

874
00:38:39,448 --> 00:38:40,788
Nine.

875
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,856
Okay. Jesse?

876
00:38:41,965 --> 00:38:43,475
Extremely confident.

877
00:38:43,586 --> 00:38:46,166
- PROBST: Okay. Nneka?
- Nine.

878
00:38:46,275 --> 00:38:48,130
We're all using different
scales. We're... [laughing]

879
00:38:48,172 --> 00:38:50,592
Like, he said, like,
"Very confident."

880
00:38:50,689 --> 00:38:51,820
I said, "Extremely confident."

881
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:53,662
He said, "Nine."
She said it, too. Sorry.

882
00:38:53,758 --> 00:38:56,028
- Like, I work on surveys,
- He got the message.

883
00:38:56,137 --> 00:38:57,406
And, like,
the response options...

884
00:38:57,448 --> 00:38:59,478
- Like, that would not work.
- [laughter]

885
00:38:59,586 --> 00:39:01,164
PROBST:
Okay, let's do it
your way just for fun.

886
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:05,716
Ten is, "Absolutely certain,
I know what's happening."

887
00:39:05,827 --> 00:39:08,827
One is, "I have no idea."
Dwight?

888
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:10,101
- Nine.
- Cody?

889
00:39:10,206 --> 00:39:11,306
Nine.

890
00:39:11,413 --> 00:39:13,383
- Jesse?
- Ten.

891
00:39:13,482 --> 00:39:14,932
[laughs]

892
00:39:15,034 --> 00:39:16,934
- You are fantastic.
- [laughter]

893
00:39:17,034 --> 00:39:18,794
- Nneka?
- I don't know. [laughs]

894
00:39:18,896 --> 00:39:22,026
PROBST:
Okay. Can we agree

895
00:39:22,137 --> 00:39:23,967
we're close to positive?

896
00:39:24,068 --> 00:39:25,998
- We're on the same scale.
We're good.
- Okay.

897
00:39:26,103 --> 00:39:27,663
Noelle, one to ten?

898
00:39:27,758 --> 00:39:29,898
Five.

899
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,790
Five could be a low number

900
00:39:31,896 --> 00:39:34,586
where, you know, I really have
no idea what's going to happen.

901
00:39:34,689 --> 00:39:36,449
And then, five could be

902
00:39:36,551 --> 00:39:38,791
maybe something
will go my way tonight.

903
00:39:42,103 --> 00:39:45,793
All right, with that,
it is time to vote.
