00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:19,786
LIANA:
Honey, I'm home.

2
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:22,956
DANNY:
Oh, my God.

3
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:25,024
-SHAN: Oh, my God.
-We were shocked.

4
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:30,096
-ALL: Oh!
-LIANA: Yeah.

5
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,866
<i>DESHAWN: So, tonight</i>
<i>we had a double elimination.</i>

6
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:36,436
So the outcome of Tribal was
exactly as I-I wanted it to be,

7
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:37,337
and Evvie went home.

8
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:39,038
<i>Unfortunately, Xander and Evvie</i>

9
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:40,774
<i>were the only ones</i>
<i>that were shocked.</i>

10
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:44,411
-Yeah, for real. For real.
-SHAN: Oh, my goodness. Okay.

11
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:49,015
Um, so, I know
Naseer was the one

12
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,817
that most folks wanted out,

13
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,020
and so I suggested for Shan

14
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,923
-to use her extra vote.
-SHAN: My extra vote.

15
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,660
LIANA:
Okay. Slam dunk.

16
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,328
Yeah, you just blind...

17
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:04,764
HEATHER: 'Cause he told me
he has two idols.

18
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,332
-That's crazy, man.
-Then he said that he had...

19
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,768
<i>ERIKA:</i>
<i>Right now,</i>
<i>Shan is definitely, like,</i>

20
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:10,403
<i>the biggest threat to win.</i>

21
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,973
The hardest thing with Shan is,
she has an idol,

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,241
and it's almost like

23
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:18,445
<i>giving, like,</i>
<i>a baby a machine gun.</i>

24
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:21,080
<i>People are afraid to target her</i>
<i>because they know that</i>

25
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:23,583
she could play the idol
at any second, and then

26
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,052
you could get hit
with a stray bullet and go home.

27
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,322
Yeah.

28
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:32,559
Yeah.

29
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,795
I... My preference would be
to get out Shan and keep Xander.

30
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,766
Because Xander has
no relationships.

31
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,135
Shan-- who knows
who she could pull in.

32
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:45,071
<i>DESHAWN:</i>
<i>Erika wants to-to make</i>
<i>the move to take out Shan,</i>

33
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,841
<i>but there's just so many factors</i>
<i>that go along with that.</i>

34
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,443
<i>I know that I have this</i>
<i>really loyal alliance in Danny,</i>

35
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,278
<i>Liana and Shan behind me,</i>

36
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:53,746
so I want to go ahead
and keep that strong,

37
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,315
<i>but at the same time,</i>

38
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:58,384
<i>Shan and I have had</i>
<i>our differences, and</i>

39
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,487
<i>I'm smart enough to know</i>
<i>she can win this game.</i>

40
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:03,556
<i>So it might be time</i>
<i>to take out Shan.</i>

41
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,298
Yeah.

42
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:15,134
<i>SHAN:</i>
<i>Seeing Deshawn go off</i>
<i>and talk with Erika</i>

43
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,370
<i>makes me a little bit nervous.</i>

44
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,205
<i>My concern with Deshawn is that</i>

45
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:22,642
<i>he's really sneaky, you know,</i>
<i>and he's very charming, and</i>

46
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,544
right now
I just don't feel like

47
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,145
I can trust Deshawn completely.

48
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,281
<i>And so, seeing him walk off</i>
<i>with Erika makes me think</i>

49
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,117
<i>that they might be trying</i>
<i>to pull a blindside.</i>

50
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,453
And so, I'm worried about that.

51
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,559
Honestly, like,
I think at this point,

52
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,494
like, you got to do
what's right for your game,

53
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:15,995
-and I got to do what's right
for my game.
-Yeah.

54
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,564
Like, that's... I feel like
that's where it's at.

55
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,299
I feel like everybody's
kind of scrambling, and...

56
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,934
But the thing is,
though, like...

57
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,804
-Yeah, I mean...
-I know Danny wants the four,
but, like...

58
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,240
we want to play our own game,
and we want to win the million

59
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,541
individually, but it's, like,

60
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,443
there's still this bigger
picture, and it's, like,

61
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,214
do you do it for the culture?
Do you do it for your...?

62
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,051
Like, in my case, like,
I'm swamped in debt.

63
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:39,519
-Yeah.
-Do I do it for my ability

64
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,220
to pay off my student loans,
or do I do it

65
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:42,655
for the bigger picture?
You know what I'm saying?

66
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,990
Well, a few years ago,
I was homeless, so I'm like...

67
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,692
-Exactly.
-"Do I do it for the culture,

68
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,560
-or I do it for a home?"
You know what I mean? So...
-Right.

69
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,562
Exactly right, and everybody
has, like, that story, right?

70
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,798
<i>SHAN:</i>
<i>Deshawn comes to me, and</i>

71
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,533
he reassures me that, you know,

72
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,501
he wants to, you know,
go final four

73
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,471
<i>with me, Liana,</i>
<i>Danny and himself because,</i>

74
00:03:58,538 --> 00:03:59,539
you know, we really want

75
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,674
to give the Black community
back home something

76
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,877
to celebrate because we know
that 2020 was a hard year.

77
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,846
<i>And so, whenever we refer to,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

78
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,448
<i>doing it for the culture,</i>
<i>that's what we're referencing.</i>

79
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,917
And so, you know,
I wanted to do that, too.

80
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,286
I... you know...
But I've also made these all...

81
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,754
these other great connections
in that game

82
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,956
that-that... that go beyond
the color lines.

83
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,459
And so, it makes it really tough
at this point.

84
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,027
I don't think people will
understand how hard it is

85
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,395
until you... until you get here.

86
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:23,763
Like, you think
it's an advantage...

87
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,998
I wanted to do it
for the culture,

88
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:26,833
and then us all
duke it out, but...

89
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,901
I would love that.
I would love it, but I...

90
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,803
I don't... I don't know
if you really...

91
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,505
-At this point, you kind of...
-I-I... I-I don't...

92
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,574
I'm not... I'm not... I'm not
a liar. What I say I mean.

93
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,676
-Yeah. Yeah.
-You know, I just...
I need to know

94
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,177
that I can trust you,
that's all, and that's...

95
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,646
-It's hard right now.
-You can.

96
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:42,615
<i>Last night when I spoke</i>
<i>to Erika, the plan was,</i>

97
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,784
<i>we were gonna try</i>
<i>to get Shan out of the game.</i>

98
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,285
<i>But then</i>
<i>I had some talks with her,</i>

99
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,122
<i>and I really do feel like,</i>
<i>coming into this game,</i>

100
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:51,891
if there were gonna be
Black players here,

101
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,926
that I wanted to play with them.

102
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:58,498
But it gets tough because you
still want to win for yourself.

103
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:01,467
But there's, like,
that duality. Like...

104
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,673
Like...

105
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,909
Hold on for a second.

106
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,546
SHAN:
At some point before Tribal,

107
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,415
we're all gonna figure out
if we trust each other or not.

108
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,450
-Yeah.
-And the vote will tell.

109

-You know?
-Yeah.

110
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:24,490
The people before us did
so much for us to be here.

111
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:26,626
And the year
that we just had-- 2020 was...

112
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,528
It was rough, bro.

113
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:30,630
It was rough, and...

114
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,633
You get this opportunity,

you always wanted,

116
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,870

117
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,339
<i>you feel like the number one</i>
<i>person standing in your way</i>

118
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:43,042
<i>is your biggest supporter</i>
<i>and your biggest ally</i>

119
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,677

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,292
there are a lot
of things there.

335
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,528
I don't want to talk
about it right now.

336
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,430
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't want to talk about it.

337
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:05,798
I don't want to talk about it.
I just...

338
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,067
I don't want to talk
about it, but I...

339
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,303
But...

340
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,838
It's not the time.

341
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,474
<i>I know that my relationship</i>
<i>with Ricard is solid.</i>

342
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,475
<i>While I have</i>

343
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:17,910
a lot of love for him,

344
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:20,412
this is still a game
for a million dollars, and I...

345
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,283
<i>I want to win, and so, I have</i>
<i>to figure out what I'm gonna do.</i>

346
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,552
(Shan hums)

347
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,654
What you singing over there?

348
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,290
Oh, sorry. Nothing.
Um, I was thinking.

349
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:53,178
Okay, so that's what I want
to talk to you about.

350
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,647
I don't trust Deshawn.

351
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:56,582
LIANA:
Mm-hmm.

352
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,917
But then I want
to do us four in the end.

353
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,086
Mm-hmm.

354
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,988
I had that moment
with you at the summit,

355
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,656
which was the biggest moment
for me in the game.

356
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,625
-Mm-hmm.
-Even now,

357
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,627
it, like, makes me emotional
just thinking about it.

358
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,463
<i>LIANA:</i>
<i>I'm on board</i>
<i>with Danny and Deshawn,</i>

359
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,732
<i>but the thing</i>
<i>about this Ricard plan is,</i>

360
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:17,469
<i>without Shan knowing, so, I go</i>
<i>back to, you know, the summit.</i>

361
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,539
<i>(crying):</i>
<i>And... there's</i>

362
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,609
nothing in this game more
precious to me than the moment

363
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,577
that me and Shan
were on the summit

364
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:30,315
on top of that gigantic hill,
just connecting over our moms

365
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,851
and our Blackness
and our womanhood.

366
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:35,454
And I was like, "You know what?

367
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,689
Like, I love you.
I love you, Shan."

368
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:40,726
And even if that means,
you know, it's idiotic of me

369
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,362
to sit next to you in the end,
I really don't care.

370
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,566
Okay.

371
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,049
...you know, wanting...
Hold on, people are coming.

372
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,859
Yeah.

373
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,900
But... it...

374
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,570
No, no, no, not tonight.

375
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,004
'Cause they want...

376
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:28,974
<i>SHAN:</i>
<i>I just knew it.</i>

377
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,943
<i>You know, I just knew</i>
<i>they were up to that.</i>

378
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,578
Which is fine.
They're playing their game.

379
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,179
They have to play that game.

380
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,248
But, you know, I don't want
Ricard leaving just yet.

381
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,916
That's not...
that's not my goal.

382
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,557
'Cause Deshawn's gonna play
the hell out of this game.

383
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,862
-So I think we need
to vote Deshawn tonight.
-Mm-hmm.

384
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,296
Mm-hmm.

385
00:18:55,834 --> 00:19:00,038
Danny, Deshawn and Liana worked
up a blindside against you

386
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:03,308
last night because they want
to separate you from me

387
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,043
because they want us
to go to the end as a four.

388
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,813
So, the plan is,

389
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,049
you, me, Liana and Xander
are gonna vote out Deshawn.

390
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:13,352
Okay.

391
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:16,722
-They're gunning for you, kid.
-Okay.

392
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,857
Let me process it.

393
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,726
-You don't believe me?
-No, I'm not saying I don't.

394
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,395
Let me pro... I mean, that's
a lot of information to take in.

395
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:24,530
So who are the ones
voting against me?

396
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:27,633
Danny, Deshawn and Liana.

397
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:28,934
Okay.

398
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,304
-But, yeah, I'm fine.
-Are you gonna go
say something to them?

399
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,572
No. No.

400
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:36,208
-I need to think.
I need to... Like, I...
-I know. I know.

401
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,877
I'm a little... You know,
my hand's a little shaky.

402
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,979
I have you.

403
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,719
I got to say, I'm surprised
that you would tell me.

404
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,721
-That I would tell you?
-Not...

405
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:50,956
Like, I'm not surprised
as like a friendship.

406
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,558
But I'm surprised,
you know, like,

407
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:55,727
that you would tell me.
Well, I mean...

408
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,362
-We've been from the beginning.
-We're gonna have to...

409
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:58,931
I know, but we're gonna have to
fight each other at some point.

410
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:02,067
I know, I know, I know, but...

411
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:06,271
-not yet. (sniffles)
-Okay.

<i>When I hear that Deshawn</i>

413

-Yeah.
-First things first. Xander,

got to take it back.

Waited so long for you
to say that.

424
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,682
Aw. Erika,
got to take yours back.

425
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,619
Gosh. You're taking Xander
and I's friendship necklaces.

-Oh, well,
glad they have another purpose.

PROBST:
For today's challenge,

433
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,069
<i>you're going</i>
<i>to stand on a narrow beam</i>

434
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:13,138
<i>while balancing a ball</i>
<i>on a disk.</i>

435
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,706
<i>At regular intervals,</i>
<i>you will move</i>

436
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,341
<i>to a more narrow part</i>
<i>of the beam</i>

437
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:19,111
<i>and move your hand</i>

438
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:21,113
<i>making it more difficult.</i>
<i>If at any point,</i>

439
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,547
<i>you fall off the beam</i>

440
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,283
<i>or your ball drops, you're out.</i>

441
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,420
Last person left standing
wins immunity,

442
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:31,189
guaranteed a spot
in the final seven.

443
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:34,960
Losers, on the other hand,
Tribal Council where somebody

444
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:38,263
will be voted out
and join the jury.

445
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,965
Big stakes,
get bigger every day.

446
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:42,334
We'll draw for spots,
we'll get started.

447
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,503
-Let's do it. All right.
-Do it.

448
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:53,345
All right, here we go. Everybody
put your ball on your disk.

449
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,514
Get it where you want it,

450
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,883
and then I'll count you down
to take your hand off.

451
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:00,419
Three,

452
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,921
two, one.

453
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:07,292
This challenge is on.

454
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:13,832
Very simple game on the surface.

455
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,834
Lot tougher than it looks.

456
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:20,372
Concentrating on lots of things.
Your feet on a narrow beam.

457
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:24,643
Your hands on your pole.

458
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,779
Balancing your ball
on your disk.

459
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:36,054
And just like that-- Liana.
Just a little bit of movement,

460
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:38,924
and she's out,
and we are down to seven.

461
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,060
You have one job right now--

462
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:43,829
keep your ball on your disk.

463
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:48,400
19 days into this game,

464
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,836
you don't want this
to be the downfall.

465
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:54,005
You lose this silly little
challenge, and you're out.

466
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,543
15 seconds left in this round.

467
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:03,148
And then we'll move down
a little farther on the beam.

468
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,251
Danny drops, will not make it
to the next round.

469
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:10,021
Five, four,

470
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:12,991
three, two, one.

471
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,760
Everybody put your hand
on your ball.

472
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:17,829
All right, everybody move down
to the next section of beam.

473
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:22,601
You're also going to move your
hand down farther on the pole.

474
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:23,935
Put your ball back up.

475
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:27,939
Here we go. Three, two,

476
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:31,409
one. This challenge is back on.

477
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:34,146
Erika drops,
can't get the transition.

478
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:37,749
Erika is out.
We are down to five.

479
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,254
We'll be here for ten minutes.

480
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,824
Heather's ball moving

481
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,824
all over that disk.

482
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:48,360
Can Heather get it back?

483
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,929
No, Heather's out.
We're down to four.

484
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:54,733
It is Ricard, Xander,
Shan and Deshawn.

485
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:59,070
Deshawn--
little bit of movement.

486
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,341
Xander locked in.

487
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,813
Ricard-- ball moving
for the first time.

488
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:11,850
Shan is locked in.

489
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:15,420
No sooner do I say that,
her ball starts to move.

490
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,023
Hang in there.

491
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:23,862
Shan continues to have
to navigate a moving ball.

492
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:27,199
Shan in trouble.

493
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:30,902
And once again, crazy save.

494
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,572
Five, four,

495
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,875
three, two, one.

496
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:39,644
Everybody put your hand
on your ball. You are all safe.

497
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:41,012
-Good job, guys.
-Really good job.

498
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,948
PROBST:
Now we move down

499
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,983
to the most narrow part
of the beam.

500
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,551
Your hands are in the same spot.

501
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,489
All right,
I'm gonna count you in.

502
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:53,491
Five, four,

503
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:56,661
three, two, one.

504
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:58,897
This challenge is back on.

505
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:03,335
Shan off balance.
Can she save it?

506
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,337
No, Shan is out.
We're down to three.

507
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:07,672
This is much more difficult.

508
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,610
You'll be in this spot
for ten minutes.

509
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,779
(birds chirping)

510
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:18,850
Other than a few birds chirping,
not a single sound.

511
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:24,022
Just Ricard, Xander and Deshawn

512
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:26,258
fighting for immunity.

513
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:28,994
How nice it would be
to go to Tribal tonight

514
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,662
with that necklace.

515
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,831
But you got to earn it.

516
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:39,738
You got to stay
in your own zone right now.

517
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:42,173
That's the trick
of this challenge.

518
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,942
You can't be distracted.

519
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,378
Don't worry about anybody else.

520
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:52,183
Deshawn-- ball moving a lot.

521
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,754
-(sighs)
-Deshawn finally drops.

522
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,892
And we are down to two.

523
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:05,897
And now, almost side by side,
we have a showdown.

524
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:09,634
Ricard and Xander-- both
have won individual immunity.

525
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:13,805
Now it's just full-on
who will outlast the other.

526
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:20,512
Ricard has been very solid,
Xander's been very solid.

527
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,781
And we've seen lots
of challenges

528
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:26,351
where players looked solid
and then dropped.

529
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,855
Ricard with a nice recovery.

530
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:36,795
Xander's ball moving
for the first time.

531
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,934
Xander drops.

532
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,602
-Wait. Did I win?
-PROBST: Ricard wins

533
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:47,205
individual immunity
for the second time.

534
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,074
(cheering, whooping)

535
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,443
Guaranteed a spot
in the final seven.

536
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,247
Ricard, come on over.

537
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:58,883
Yeah.

538
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,820
For the second time this season,

539
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:04,656
individual immunity is yours.

540
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,691
You are safe tonight, guaranteed

541
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:10,295
a spot in the final seven
of<i> Survivor 41.</i>

542
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:12,564
As for the rest of you,
after 19 days,

543
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,532
one of you will be going home
tonight.

544
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:15,834
Won't be you.
Congratulations.

545
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,004
Grab your stuff. Head back to
camp. See you tonight at Tribal.

546
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:21,973
<i>DANNY: Going into</i>
<i>the immunity challenge,</i>

547
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,476
the worst case scenario would be
if Ricard wins.

548
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,712
<i>But he somehow pulls it out,</i>
<i>and my heart drops.</i>

549
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,115
<i>You know, we lost our</i>
<i>opportunity to get Ricard out,</i>

550
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,483
<i>so it's back to square one</i>

551
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,118
<i>and try to figure out</i>
<i>what to do next.</i>

552
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,103
-Good job, Ricard.
-Good job.

553
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,873
Good job, Ricard,
with your jewels.

554
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:57,175
-RICARD: Thank you.
-ERIKA: Good job.

555
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:00,645
Congrats, Ricard.
This was a tough one.

556
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:03,248
<i>SHAN: Ricard wins, and I'm glad</i>
<i>because that means, like,</i>

557
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:04,516
he's immune, he's safe,
so I don't really

558
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:05,617
have to go to bat for him.

559
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:10,889
<i>SHAN:</i>
<i>I could get Deshawn out,</i>

560
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:12,524
<i>but because Ricard is safe,</i>

561
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,859
<i>I want to keep</i>
<i>the waters super calm.</i>

562
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:17,495
-There you go.
<i>-SHAN: Voting Erika</i>
<i>can be simple.</i>

563
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:20,698
<i>A lot of us want Erika out.</i>
<i>She's smart, she's sneaky.</i>

564
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:24,903
<i>And so, I'm actually okay with</i>
<i>letting it be Erika tonight.</i>

565
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:27,906
SHAN:
I think that's what we do.
I think we put all of our votes

566
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:29,741
on Erika, but we don't
give Xander a name

567
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:33,178
so that he feels nervous
and he plays the idol.

568
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:34,345
-That's the safest thing?
-SHAN: That's the safest thing.

569
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:36,414
We just put all of our votes
on Erika. It's five of us.

570
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,116
Even if they have four,
it's five of us.

571
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:40,852
And we don't tell Xander
anything. I think

572
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,554
-Xander's gonna
keep his extra vote.
-DANNY: I think so, too.

573
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,055
But I think
he's gonna play his idol.

574
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,523
-Just don't talk to Xander.
-DANNY: Let's just do that.

575
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,192
<i>RICARD: Shan is a very special</i>
<i>person to me.</i>

576
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:50,495
<i>But when she decides to get rid</i>
<i>of me with her four people,</i>

577
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,430
I'm next. That was supposed
to be the case today.

578
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:55,700
I was supposed to be going home
today, tonight,

579
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,268

580
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:58,837
-SHAN: Are you in?
-I'm in...
-LIANA: But hold on...

581
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,238
<i>RICARD:</i>
<i>So I've decided</i>

582
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,240
that today is the day
for Shan to go.

583
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,576
(squeaking)

584
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,848
XANDER:
I'm-I'm probably gonna play it.

585
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,083
RICARD:
It's a bummer
because I honestly think

586
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,787
it would be a waste,
but I have an idea.

587
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:23,094
Erika, me, you, you.
That's four.

588
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,930
HEATHER:
I like that plan.

589
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,332
-Yeah.
-Shan.
-I like this.

590
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:29,868
<i>RICARD:</i>
<i>We have four votes</i>
<i>to get out Shan.</i>

591
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,903
<i>We only need one more, but</i>

592
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,506
I don't feel like
there's anyone I can really

593
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:38,076
guarantee will be
this extra vote.

594
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,982
...that you had talked to Danny,

595
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:46,151
and you had all decided
to vote me out today.

596
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,086
And that, "They're switching
the entire vote

597
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:49,921
to you to get you out."

598
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:57,028
<i>RICARD: Deshawn continues</i>
<i>to lie, and I don't respect it.</i>

599
00:29:57,095 --> 00:30:00,465
It bothers me, it annoys me,
but I still think

600
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:03,968
he's the best choice
moving forward today.

601
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:05,236
And he can go home tomorrow.

602
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,173
The only path forward
for me is with her gone.

603
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:13,344
...at this point, I'm
completely on board with you.

604
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,080
One thousand percent.

605
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,415
<i>I'm having these moral dilemmas.</i>

606
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,083
<i>I want to kind of</i>
<i>protect the four.</i>

607
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,718
I really wanted
to believe in Shan.

608
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:21,953
I really, truly did.

609
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:32,030
<i>DESHAWN:</i>
<i>Shan snitched on me.</i>
<i>I mean, yes,</i>

610
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:33,498
I was definitely trying
to take out Ricard.

611
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,667
She wasn't lying,
but at the same time,

612
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:38,603
it's like, now I know for sure
I can't trust you.

613
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,872
<i>Like, you said,</i>
<i>my name to go home.</i>

614
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:43,508
<i>Now you've revealed my plans</i>

616
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:51,516
Who? Okay.

617
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:56,654
So... it's not gonna be you.

618
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:58,356
Then...

619
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,058
Yeah.

620
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:07,832
<i>ERIKA:</i>
<i>So the goal is to get out Shan.</i>

621
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:11,302
<i>But Shan has an idol,</i>
<i>and if Shan uses her idol,</i>

622
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,372
that group can decide who gets
knocked out, and it could be me.

623

<i>Danny and I were original Luvu.</i>
<i>Maybe</i>

624
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:20,078
I can get Danny to vote
with us, too.

625
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:21,412
I wanted to talk,

626
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,481
and everybody's all
in different places, so...

627
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,949
Well, we know
who's not going home tonight.

00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,050
-ERIKA: Ricard?
-Yup.

-And Xander.
-HEATHER: Yeah.

Okay.

DANNY:
Yeah, Shan pissed me off today.

00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:42,900
ERIKA:
What happened?

634
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:46,704
I don't want to blow up
the game, but, yeah, I would.

635
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:49,107
-Maybe we can work with that.
-Yeah.

636
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,276
<i>ERIKA:</i>
<i>I'm thinking three people vote</i>
<i>for Shan,</i>

637
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:53,177
<i>three people vote for Liana.</i>

638

<i>If Shan doesn't play her idol,</i>

639
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:58,149
we revote between Liana

<i>If Shan plays her idol,</i>
<i>Liana goes home.</i>

641

How would you feel
if we did three votes on Shan,

642
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:05,056
three votes on Liana,

643
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:06,891
and then
Liana and Shan vote wherever?

644
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,327
If Shan plays her idol,
Liana gets knocked out.

-HEATHER: Yeah.
-Okay.

646
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,998
That is a nice plan.

<i>When you see Erika making</i>
<i>these moves,</i>

DANNY:
Throw my whole game over that?

651
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:27,879
The beautiful thing
about this setup right now...

652
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:29,547
<i>DANNY:</i>
<i>It is very difficult</i>
<i>to split votes</i>

653
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,015
<i>to flush out idols.</i>

654
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:33,184
<i>One vote can change</i>
<i>the entire plan.</i>

655
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:34,819
So in Tribal Council,
I do have a choice.

656
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:45,396
<i>Me and Deshawn could choose</i>
<i>to keep Shan in the game,</i>

657
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,498
<i>or make a bigger move</i>
<i>of voting out Erika,</i>

658
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:49,000
<i>which I would rather do.</i>

659
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,703
<i>She is a dangerous player.</i>

660
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:54,105
But Shan is the one
who broke my trust.

661
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:58,543
<i>We put a lot into the four of us</i>
<i>making it to the final four,</i>

662
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:02,013
<i>and the fact that Shan is</i>
<i>willing to throw that away</i>

663
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,716
<i>because of some</i>
<i>19-day friendship with Ricard--</i>

664
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:06,050
<i>that just doesn't vibe with me.</i>

00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:07,151

"We could make a move."

689
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,836
I would consider myself
in the bottom half for sure.

690
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,272
I think that maybe
there's something

691
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,741
that we can do
with the people at the bottom,

692
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,609

it's whether you're a part

693
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:41,345
of the planning,

694

as at the bottom, anybody could
be perceived at the top.

702
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:00,965
It's all about the conversation
that you're having.

703

one relationship away

706
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:10,708

really weird relationship.

We didn't just say, you know,

715
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:30,661
from the very beginning, "It's
the two of us till the end."

716
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:32,530
It's really just
who you can trust

717
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,265
for as long as you can trust.

718
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:37,735
-Shan, you're nodding.
-Um,

719
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,270
we are all liars here,

720
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:41,739
and when you're working with
someone, you've got to just say,

721
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,541
"What's the risk
with this liar?" Like,

722
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,076
what's the cost
to them working with me?

723
00:35:45,142 --> 00:35:47,645

But lies can get messy.

with something else or something
else. At the same time,

00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:56,020
when you find a good group
of people,

728
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,622

you can tell the truth

So, Erika, if you feel
you're on the bottom,

734
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:15,273
do you just hope that people
are gonna battle it out,

735
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,641
or do you try to make a move?

736
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:19,043
ERIKA:
You can't not try
to do something.

737
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,811
And I think for anyone,

738
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:24,081
the one pitch they have is,
their vote counts the same

739
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:25,416
as anybody else's vote.

740
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:28,119
So, what I can offer people
is a vote,

741
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:30,354
and see if we can get
something moving.

742
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:32,223
PROBST:
Shan, when Erika says,

743
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,558
"I got a piece of parchment.

744
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:35,159
Tell me what name
to write down,"

745
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:37,228
is that scary,
or is that an opportunity?

746
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:39,530
Absolutely both,

747
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:42,466
but if that individual has not
talked strategy

748
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:46,671
with you in that day,
then it becomes, like, scary.

749
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:49,006
Are you referring to Erika
in that situation?

750
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:51,709
I mean, I-I-I... maybe,

751
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:53,678
but I've-I've worked with Erika,
and she's a trustworthy person.

752
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:56,347
-So...
-ERIKA: Yeah, I mean, like,

753
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:57,982
we didn't get the chance
to talk today.

754
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,984
But Shan
and I have worked together.

755
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,587
We-we pulled off
the Naseer blindside

756
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,655
together, so there...

757
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,090
I-I hope
there's, like, some level

758
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,125
-of trust between us.
-For sure. Yeah.

759
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:10,161
PROBST:
Ricard, are there ever

760
00:37:10,227 --> 00:37:13,297
conversations where they go,
"Look, there's still some people

761
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,666
on the bottom.
Let's just get them"?

762
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,602
RICARD:
Logically, you would think

763
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:19,270
that's how it is at camp,

764
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:22,974
but most of what's going on
is perception of oneself.

765
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,278
So, Erika feels very insecure
and on the bottom.

766
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,146
And then he has an idol,

767
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:30,681
which is so public
that now he feels

768
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,350
on the bottom, and, like...

769
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,719
It's just all our perception
of ourselves.

770
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:36,621
PROBST:
So, Liana, you guys

771
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,923
all have your own awareness
of yourself.

772
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,524
You have awareness
of everybody else.

773
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,594
And yet I'm guessing
tonight's gonna be a blindside.

774
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:47,398
What does that say about how
you have to play<i> Survivor?</i>

775
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,166
LIANA:
Yeah, Jeff. I'm a student,

776
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:51,369
and I've studied
very complex things,

777
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,372
and when I'm playing this game,
I feel like my mind is, like,

778
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,407
spinning around and around
and around and around.

779
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:58,209
And so, right now, everyone
thinks they have an idea

780
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:00,511
of what's going on,
but one of us is wrong,

and that's going
to show up tonight.

782
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,448

this game is absolutely insane
