00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,452
IN HIS POCTD.

191
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:28,745
JON, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

192
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,497
AND JACLYN WAS LEFT ALL ALONE.

193
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,125
"SURVIVOR" IS A TRICKY GAME.

194
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,418
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT YOU'VE

195
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,587
FORGOTTEN THE BASIC PREMISE--

196
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,089
OUTWIT, OUTPLAY, OUTLAST.

197
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,215
THIS GAME IS WIDE OPEN.

198
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,341
FIVE ARE LEFT.

199
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,010
MISSY AND BAYLOR.

200
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,220
THEY'RE THE ONLY PAIR OF LOVED

201
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,472
ONES REMAINING.

202
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,182
NO STRANGERS TO ADVERSITY,

203
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,850
THEY'VE STUCK TOGETHER THROUGH

204
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,226
MISSY'S MULTIPLE DIVORCES AND

205
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,315
AND ARE FOUR DAYS FROM ACHIEVING

206
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:57,940
THEIR GOAL OF MAKING IT TO THE

207
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:58,274
END TOGETHER.

208
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:01,110
>> I FOUGHT LIKE HELL TO STAY IN

209
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,737
THIS GAME, KEEP MY DAUGHTER IN

210
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,947
THE GAME, BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP

211
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:05,198
FIGHTING.

212
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,074
>> THE MILLION DOLLARS AT THE

213
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:06,449
FINISH LINE.

214
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,409
ALL OF OUR DREAMS COULD BE

215
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:08,659
FULFILLED.

216
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,620
>> Jeff: NATALIE, AFTER HER

217
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,038
SISTER, NADIYA, WAS THE FIRST

218
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,873
PERSON VOTED OUT, SHE HAD ONLY

219
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,333
HERSELF TO RELY ON.

220
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,417
GAVE HER THE COURAGE TO MAKE BIG

221
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:20,338
MOVES AND WITH AN IDOL IN HER

222
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:20,922
POCKET, SHE'S NOT DONE YET.

223
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:24,383
>> WHEN NADIYA GOT OUT, IT LIT A

224
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,511
FIRE UNDER ME, I'M GOING TO GET

225
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,387
IF FOR NADIYA, JUST TO PROVE TO

226
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,430
EVERYBODY ELSE THAT I'M THE BEST

227
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,225
ONE OUT HERE.

228
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,601
>> Jeff: JACLYN, SHE AND HER

229
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,645
BOYFRIEND, JON, DOMINATED THE

230
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,981
GAME, BUT AFTER JON'S BLINDSIDE,

231
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,858
SHE'S LEFT ALONE TO FEND FOR

232
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:41,109
HERSELF.

233
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:41,692
>> JON AND I WERE IN THE GAME

234
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:41,984
TOGETHER.

235
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:42,443
WE PLAYED AS A TEAM.

236
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,612
WE CARRIED EACH OTHER

237
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:44,904
ESSENTIALLY.

238
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:48,032
BUT I'M IN THIS GAME FOR MYSELF

239
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,200
NOW, AND I'M NOT GOING DOWN

240
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,369
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

241
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:51,744
>> Jeff: KEITH.

242
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,122
>> I BET YOU'RE SURPRISED TO SEE

243
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,332
ME AGAIN, AIN'T YOU?

244
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,000
>> Jeff: THIS 53-YEAR-OLD

245
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:58,668
FIREMAN CAME INTO THE GAME AS AN

246
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,045
UNDERDOG, BUT AFTER 35 DAYS,

247
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,132
HE'S OUTLASTED HIS SON, WON

248
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,133
MULTIPLE IMMUNITY CHALLENGES,

249
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,885
AND IS DETERMINED TO BEAT THE

250
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:08,094
ODDS.

251
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:11,806
>> I THINK I GOT THIS, BABY.

252
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,266
CONFIDENCE.

253
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:13,766
P.M.A.-- POSITIVE MENTAL

254
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,435
ATTITUDE.

255
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,771
>> Jeff: IT ALL CONCLUDES

256
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:19,564
TONIGHT.

257
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,858
WHO WILL WIN THE MILLION-DOLLAR

258
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,610
PRIZE AND THE TITLE OF "SOLE

259
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:33,619
SURVIVOR IN?

260
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,132
>> YOU GOTTA DO WHAT YOU GOTTA

261
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:46,382
DO, RIGHT?

262
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:47,175
>> I GUESS SO.

263
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,593
DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.

264
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,304
I HAD THIS GUT FEELING THAT

265
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:51,888
MAYBE JON SHOULD PLAY HIS IDOL

266
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,598
JUST IN CASE, BUT WE REALLY

267
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,766
TRUSTED MISSY, NATALIE, AND

268
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,476
BAYLOR, AND WE GOT SCREWED.

269
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,437
BUT, DAMN, YOU GUYS, GOOD

270
00:07:59,520 --> 00:07:59,687
ACTING.

271
00:07:59,770 --> 00:07:59,979
>> I KNOW--

272
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,689
>> IT WAS ALL A BIG FAKE.

273
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,066
BECAUSE THAT'S CRAZY.

274
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,735
>> I' LOYAL TO A FAULT.

275
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,112
IN MY LIFE, I'M LOYAL TO A

276
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:08,321
FAULT.

277
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:08,821
>> SO IS HE.

278
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:09,614
>> NO, NOT REALLY.

279
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,032
>> YEAH.

280
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:11,699
YOU HAVE KNOWN HIM FOR 35 DAYS.

281
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,576
>> I'M TALKING ABOUT IN THIS

282
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,036
GAME, GIRL.

283
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:15,953
THIS IS NOT THE REAL LIFE.

284
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,705
>> SHE JUST SAID IN HER REAL

285
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,081
LIFE SHE SAID SHE IS LOYAL TO A

286
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,708
FAULT AND I SAID JON IS LOYAL TO

287
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,335
A FAULT IN HIS REAL LIFE.

288
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,920
SO DON'T ( BLEEP ) SAY YOU KNOW

289
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:24,378
JON BECAUSE YOU DON'T.

290
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,839
>> I KNOW JON IN THIS GAME.

291
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:27,882
>> NOT IN REAL LIFE.

292
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,760
>> I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT REAL

293
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:31,969
LIFE.

294
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,721
>> SHE WAS AND SO WAS I?

295
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,514
IT WAS REALLY HARD AFTER TRIBAL.

296
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,600
I JUST FELT LIKE SINCE THE

297
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,685
MERGE, EVERYBODY LOVED ME AND

298
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:39,852
JON.

299
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,773
I DON'T SEE PEOPLE EVER, EVER IN

300
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,066
REAL LIFE SAYING BAD THINGS

301
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:45,608
ABOUT JON.

302
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,776
IT WAS REALLY HURTFUL.

303
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,237
AND I JUST SNAPPED.

304
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,491
I WENT OFF ON NATALIE.

305
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,077
>> I MEAN, I JUST MAKE MY

306
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,119
OBSERVATION ON WHAT HAS

307
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:57,370
HAPPENED.

308
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,413
>> KEEP IT COYOURSELF IF IT'S

309
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,290
GOING TO BE TALKING ( BLEEP ) TO

310
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:01,499
MY FACE.

311
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,501
I DON'T NEED TO HEAR.

312
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,210
IT ( BLEEP ).

313
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,002
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

314
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,714
>> IT'S BECAUSE JACLYN HAD A FIT

315
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,799
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

316
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,801
IF ANYTHING IS TRYING TO WORK

317
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,511
WITH HER, IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

318
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,137
IT DOES SCARE ME A LITTLE BIT

319
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:15,763
WHERE NOW I'M IN THE SITUATION

320
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:16,681
WHERE I HAVE TO TRUST BAYLOR AND

321
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,016
MISSY TO WANT TO TAKE ME TO THE

322
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,351
FINAL THREE FOR THEM BECAUSE AT

323
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,811
THIS POINT THEY COULD

324
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,689
TECHNICALLY VOTE ME OUT UNLESS I

325
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:25,856
WIN IMMUNITY.

326
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,983
THAT'S WHAT "SURVIVOR" IS.

327
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:27,608
IT'S A LOT OF WORK BUT THERE'S A

328
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,859
BIG PRIZE AT THE END.

329
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:29,860
YOU HAVE TO PUT IN WORK IF YOU

330
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,989
WANT TO WIN THIS.

331
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:51,549
♪♪

332
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:58,723
>> THE FACT WE MADE IT TO THE

333
00:09:58,806 --> 00:09:59,890
FINAL FIVE AND WE COULD GO TO

334
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,392
THE FINAL THREE TOGETHER TO ME

335
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,060
IS JUST, LIKE, SO COOL.

336
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,187
>> BUT LET'S THINK ABOUT THE

337
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:05,813
END-ALL GOAL.

338
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,106
THE GOAL IS FOR US TO WIN.

339
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,524
>> I KNOW.

340
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:09,775
YOUR DREAM AND MY DREAM WAS FOR

341
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:10,651
US TO MAKE THE TOP THREE.

342
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,819
>> I KNOW THAT.

343
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:12,653
WHY ARE YOU CRYING IT?

344
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,363
WE HAVEN'T STARTED.

345
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,656
>> WE HAVE FOUR DAYS LEFT.

346
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,241
I CAN SEE THE FINISH LINE.

347
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,534
I CAN SEE THE FINAL THREE.

348
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:20,036
I CAN SEE THE FINAL TRIBAL.

349
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,454
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE THINKING

350
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,373
NATALIE, MY MOM, AND I FOR FINAL

351
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:24,874
THREE.

352
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,752
>> DO YOU FEEL TOTALLY STRONGLY

353
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,128
ABOUT US GOING TO THE FINAL

354
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:29,920
THREE, THEN LET'S DO IT.

355
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:30,921
>> DO YOU NOT AT ALL?

356
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,507
>> NO, NO, I FEEL TOTALLY

357
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:34,467
STRONGLY ABOUT IT.

358
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,801
HAVING BAYLOR HERE WE NOW HAVE

359
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,803
TWO SHOTS AT A MILLION BUCKS,

360
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,263
BUT I'M NOT REALLY SURE ABOUT

361
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,097
THESE CHALLENGES.

362
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,017
I FRACTURED MY FOOT, AND I HAVE

363
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,727
THIS HARD CAST NOW ON MY FOOT.

364
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,854
JUST SO FRUSTRATING.

365
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,606
WE CHOSE TO GO TO THE FINAL

366
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:48,981
THREE TOGETHER.

367
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:49,982
>> COOL, I LIKE IT.

368
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,027
>> SO THE GAME PLAN NOW IS FOR

369
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,862
NATALIE AND BAYLOR TO START

370
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:55,404
CRUSHING THESE CHALLENGES

371
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,364
OPINION THE LAST THING WE WANT

372
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,074
IS FOR KEITH OR JACLYN TO WIN IT

373
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:03,954
FROM HEREON OUT.

374

00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,715
ADVANTAGE IN THE NEXT IMMUNITY

562
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:30,340
CHALLENGE.

563
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,091
TUT IT TO GOOD USE.

564
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,176
YOU COULD BE STANDING HERE AGAIN

565
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,260
WITH A NECKLACE AROUND YOUR

566
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,344
NECK.

567
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,805
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING FOR.

568
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,599
>> Jeff: KEITH, NATALIE,

569
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,266
BAYLOR, MISSY, GRAB YOUR STUFF.

570
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,100
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

571
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,479
>> GETTING BEAT PIE BOO A

572
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,271
55-YEAR-OLD MAN IS NOT EASY.

573
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,148
I NEED TO BE ABLE TO BEAT HIM AT

574
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:46,690
THAT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE EVEN

575
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,025
WITH HIS ADVANTAGE.

576
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:48,567
IT'S ANYTHING TO BE REALLY

577
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,235
TOUGH, BUT IF I WANT MY PLAN TO

578
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,112
GO THE WAY I WANT IT TO, THEN I

579
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,406
NEED TO GET RID OF KEITH FIRST.

580
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,660
>> Jeff: IT IS GETTING GOOD.

581
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,871
OKAY, SO WE'RE 36 DAYS INTO THE

582
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,207
SHOW, AND YOU CAN SEE HOW

583
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,750
PHYSICALLY EXHAUSTED THE

584
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,501
CONTESTANTS ARE.

585
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,126
AND STILL I GET ASKED THIS A

586
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,545
LOT, "HOW MUCH FOOD DO THEY

587
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,546
REALLY LIVE ON?"

588
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,923
SO I WANT TO TRY TO CLEAR THIS

589
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:11,548
UP TONIGHT.

590
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,966
EACH SEASON, THE SURVIVORS ARE

591
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,218
GIVEN A BAG OF RICE, AND THEY'RE

592
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,219
TOLD TO RATION IT.

593
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:18,430
THIS SEASON, ONE TRIBE ATE A

594
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,014
LITTLE MORE THAN THEY SHOULD,

595
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:20,891
BUT NORMALLY THEY STICK TO IT.

596
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:21,850
AND HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

597
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:22,684
THIS IS WHAT YOU GET.

598
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:23,227
THIS IS IT.

599
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,730
THIS IS A HALF A CUP OF COOKED

600
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,398
RICE, ABOUT 100 CALORIES.

601
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,859
THIS IS WHAT THEY GET EACH DAY.

602
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,443
SOMETIMES THEY CATCH A FISH.

603
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,904
YOU'VE SEEN THEM, THEY'RE PRETTY

604
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:34,112
SMALL.

605
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,364
SOMETIMES THEY GET REWARDS.

606
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,156
IT GOES THROUGH YOU PRETTY

607
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:36,365
QUICKLY.

608
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,659
JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME COMPARISON

609
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:38,867
HERE.

610
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,287
THIS IS WHAT THEY LIVE ON EACH

611
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:42,454
DAY.

612
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,542
THIS IS WHAT THE AVERAGE

613
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,167
AMERICAN EATS EACH DAY.

614
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,252
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

615
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:51,630
YOU HAVE YOUR BREAKFAST, SOME

616
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,173
EGGS MAYBE SOME TOAST.

617
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,216
THEN YOU HAVE MAYBE A BURGER,

618
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,510
YOU LOVE YOUR FRENCH FRIES,

619
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:57,511
OKAY, SOMETHING TO DRINK.

620
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,471
AND THEN DOWN THERE AT THE END

621
00:18:59,555 --> 00:18:59,805
IS SPAGHETTIS.

622
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,181
THIS IS ABOUT 2500 CALORIES.

623
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,559
THIS IS FROM THE U.S.D.A., I'M

624
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,226
NOT MAKING THIS STUFF UP.

625
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,936
COMPARED TO THIS.

626
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,271
THIS SHOW IS REAL.

627
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,481
THIS SHOW WILL KICK YOUR ASS.

628
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,733
AND YOU-- GLENN, LET'S GO DOWN

629
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:11,942
THERE.

630
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:12,234
STAY THERE.

631
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,944
I'M COMING TO YOU.

632
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:14,403
I SAW YOU EARLIER.

633
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,655
YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING AT ME.

634
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:17,239
YOU'RE A "SURVIVOR" FAN,

635
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,407
OBVIOUSLY?

636
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:18,866
>> YES.

637
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:19,741
>> Jeff: DO YOU EVER THINK

638
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,284
ABOUT DOING THIS SHOW?

639
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,618
>> SOMETIMES.

640
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,286
>> Jeff: WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

641
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:25,831
>> OLIVIA FELLEDMAN.

642
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:26,874
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, OLIVIA, DO

643
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,292
YOU THINK YOU COULD DO IT?

644
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,461
>> MAYBE IN A LONG TIME.

645
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:31,795
( LAUGHTER ).

646
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:32,963
>> Jeff: OKAY.

647
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:33,589
WELL, THERE'S NO BHRT TIME THAN

648
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,173
THE PRESENT TO START.

649
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,092
THIS IS YOUR FIRST CHALLENGE.

650
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:37,759
THIS IS ALL THE FOOD YOU GET FOR

651
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,302
THE REST OF THE NIGHT.

652
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,721
GOOD LUCK.

653
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:44,808
<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>

654
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:45,767
>> OKAY.

655
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,351
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SO-- WE'RE

656
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,687
GOING TO SEE HER ON THE SHOW ONE

657
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,897
DAY AND YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE ME

658
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,189
EAT THAT RICE MYSELF.

659
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:51,773
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO SEE

660
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,026
NOW WHAT HAPPENS WITH KEITH.

661
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,652
HE JUST WON THIS ADVANTAGE.

662
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:56,904
IT'S A BIG ADVANTAGE, BUT THE

663
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:00,949
QUESTION I IS WILL IT PAY OFF.

664
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:01,575
IT'S THE "SURVIVOR: SAN JUAN DEL

665
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,577
SUR: BLOOD VS. WATER" FINALE

666
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,246
CONTINUING RIGHT AFTER THIS.

667
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,333
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

668
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:36,443
"UNDERNEATH A CAVE OF ROCKS

669
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,987
HIDES AN IDOL WHICH IMPROVES

670
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:39,696
YOUR CHANCES."

671
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,366
THE SAME CLUE EVERYBODY ELSE

672
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:48,538
GOT.

673
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,958
I'M ON EXILE, AND JON GOT VOTED

674
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:51,124
OUT.

675
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:51,667
I MEAN, AT THIS POINT IN THE

676
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,169
GAME, THE NEXT TRIBAL, IT'S

677
00:20:54,252 --> 00:21:02,010
BASICALLY ME OR KEITH.

678
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:02,636
OH!

679
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,304
THIS GAME, MAN, IT MAKES YOU

680
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:08,433
EMOTIONAL.

681
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,102
I'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT IN MY

682
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:10,310
LIFE.

683
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,937
YOU KNOW, BEING DIAGNOSED WITH

684
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,896
NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE KIDS AND

685
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,564
ALL THAT, WHEN I WAS REALLY

686
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,525
YOUNG.

687
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,568
SO, THIS IS ONE NIGHT, AND IN

688
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,319
THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS, I

689
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,530
FEEL LIKE I'M FIGHT FOR ME AND

690
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,199
JON NOW, FOR MONEY TO HAVE KIDS

691
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:24,533
IN THE FUTURE.

692
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,410
AND IF JON WAS HERE AND HE COULD

693
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:29,413
GIVE ME A PEP TALK HE'D BE LIKE,

694
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:29,871
"YOU'RE ALMOST DONE.

695
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,498
YOU'VE DONE WAY HARDER THINGS IN

696
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,833
YOUR LIFE THAN THIS.

697
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,752
JUST ROCK IT OUT."

698
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:39,423
AND I'M GOING TO DO THAT.

699
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,683
>> GOOD JOB, KEITH, WAY TO GO.

700
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:50,809
>> THAT WAS CRAZY.

701
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,645
>> THAT WAS INTENSE.

702
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:57,190
>> THE REWARD CHALLENGE WAS

703
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:57,399
SUCKY.

704
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,525
KEITH WON.

705
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,485
WHICH MEANS HE GOT AN ADVANTAGE.

706
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,612
UN, IT'S FRUSTRATING BECAUSE HE

707
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,031
IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE THREAT.

708
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,699
>> OKAY, SO LET'S TALK ABOUT

709
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:05,907
THIS.

710
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,200
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THAT IS.

711
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,619
IT GIVES HIM AN ADVANTAGE

712
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:09,911
TOMORROW.

713
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,663
>> I HOPE IT'S AN ENDURANCE.

714
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,873
>> IT WILL BE TOMORROW, BECAUSE

715
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:13,665
WE HAVE TOMORROW AND THE NEXT

716
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:14,624
DAY AND THEN THAT'S IT.

717
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,460
>> BUT TOMORROW, IF HE DOESN'T

718
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,879
WIN, LET'S SEND HIM HOME

719
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:19,171
IMMEDIATELY.

720
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:23,008
>> YEAH.

721
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,384
>> THE LITTLE NOTE SAID READ IN

722
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,679
PRIVATE SO I SNUCK OFF AND READ

723
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:27,846
IT.

724
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:31,058
"YOU HAVE EARNED AN ADVANTAGE IN

725
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,559
THE NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

726
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,436
A CHALLENGE TABLE HAS BEEN

727
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,520
DELIVERED TO A PRIVATE SPOT AT

728
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,855
YOUR CAMP.

729
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:37,939
YOU CAN PRACTICE FOR AS LONG AS

730
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,816
YOU WANT, BUT ONCE YOU STOP, YOU

731
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:46,281
ARE FINISHED."

732
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,157
GOOD GRIEF.

733
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,492
"THIS CHALLENGE REQUIRES

734
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,951
PATIENCE AND FINESSE.

735
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:53,163
YOU WILL USE A SERIES OF METAL

736
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,207
SPOONS TO TRANSFER BECAUSE

737
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,125
THROUGH A SERIES OF OBSTACLES

738
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,044
FROM ONE SIDE OF THE TABLE TO

739
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,253
THE OTHER."

740
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,671
WHEN I GOT TO THE TABLE, IT HAD

741
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,381
A FEW MORE CLUES, YOU KNOW,

742
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,550
TELLING ME HOW THE CHALLENGE

743
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,093
WORKS.

744
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,678
THERE WASN'T NOTHING TO FILL ME

745
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:09,096
IN.

746
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,555
OH, IT GOES LIKE THAT?

747
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,640
I MEAN, IT TOOK ME A LITTLE

748
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,309
WHILE TO FIGURE IT OUT.

749
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:25,654
START IT LIKE THAT.

750
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:30,742
THE CHALLENGE TABLE HAS GOT FOUR

751
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,036
HANDLES AND YOU JUST PASS A BALL

752
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,663
TO A PADDLE OVER AN OBSTACLE TO

753
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:35,622
ANOTHER PADDLE, COMPLETE THAT

754
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:38,500
THREE TIMES, BAM.

755
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,501
NECKLACE AROUND YOUR NECK.

756
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:43,839
WHOA!

757
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,382
I'M GOING TO STAY HERE AND

758
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:46,550
PRACTICE BECAUSE I NEED THAT

759
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,970
NECKLACE TOMORROW.

760
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:54,349
THIS IS A BIG ADVANTAGE, BELIEVE

761
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:54,641
ME.

762
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,184
THERE DOES COME A POINT IN THE

763
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,354
FIRE SERVICE WHERE IT'S STAY AND

764
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,773
DIE OR JUMP OUT THE WINDOW.

765
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:02,649
IT'S CALLED FLASH OVER.

766
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,234
THIS ROOM IS FIXING TO FLASH

767
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,027
OVER, AND YOU BETTER DO

768
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,195
SOMETHING QUICK LIKE.

769
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,530
IT'S TO THE POINT NOW I'M ON THE

770
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,740
HOT SEAT, BUT I THINK MAYBE I'M

771
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:11,616
NOT FLASHED OVER YET.

772
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,286
I'M PROBABLY GOING TO PRACTICE

773
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,287
UNTIL DARK.

774
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,705
I'M READY TO GO TACKLE THIS BABY

775
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:20,333
AND GET THAT NECKLACE.

776
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,259
YOUR CONCENTRATION AIN'T AS GOOD

777
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:29,759
AS IT WAS WHEN YOU FIRST

778
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,010
STARTED.

779
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,721
I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT'S SO HARD

780
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:33,013
RIGHT THERE.

781
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,098
GOOD GRIEF, MAN.

782
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:40,645
I'M GOING MENTALLY.

783
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,605
OH!

784
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:41,938
WHOA!

785
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:46,401
ALL I CAN DO RIGHT NOW IS WIN

786
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:47,903
CHALLENGES, AND GO FOR THAT

787
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:48,153
NECKLACE.

788
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:54,659
I'M LOSING FOCUS.

789
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,506
>> YUP.

790
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,174
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

791
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,634
>> I THINK IT'S UP TO GUYS.

792
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:11,593
I HAVE SAID-- BASICALLY, I HAVE

793
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,970
TWO DECISIONS AT THIS POINT.

794
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:17,224
MISSY AND BAYLOR, FEEL LIKE I'M

795
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:17,974
DEFINITELY GOING TO BE WITH

796
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:18,600
MISSY AND BAYLOR, BUT I COULD

797
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,684
DECIDE TO GO WITH KEITH AND

798
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,686
JACLYN AND SAY LET'S GET ONE OF

799
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,480
THESE GIRLS OUT.

800
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,105
LET'S TRY AND MAKE IT HAPPEN.

801
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,650
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

802
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:27,817
THAT'S HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

803
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,819
>> I HAVE AN IDOL FOR MYSELF IF

804
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:30,737
I DON'T WIN IMMUNITY, BUT THE

805
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,030
ADVANTAGE IS BASICALLY GOING TO

806
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,990
HELP KEITH IN THE NEXT IMMUNITY

807
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:34,282
CHALLENGE.

808
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,867
IT TOTALLY SUCKS THAT HE GOT IS

809
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,495
BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO BE HARD TO

810
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:38,703
BEAT.

811
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:39,287
I KNOW IT'S A BIG DECISION ON

812
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,914
WHO GOES HOME TONIGHT.

813
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:50,131
>> HEY, LET'S WIN.

814
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:11,736
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

815
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,779
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

816
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,823
JACLYN, RETURNING FROM EXILE

817
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,700
ISLAND.

818
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,785
>> YEAH, JACLYN.

819
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:21,871
>> HI, GUYS!

820
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,165
I'M ALIVE.

821
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,960
>> Jeff: SO, JACLYN, HOW WAS

822
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:27,335
EXILE ALL ALONE?

823
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,921
>> WELL, IT DEFINITELY SUCKED

824
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:30,380
BEING AWAY FROM CAMP.

825
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,132
I MEAN, IT'S A TERRIBLE TIME TO

826
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,258
GO AWAY TO EXILE.

827
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:34,843
>> Jeff: AND, MISSY, YOU HAVE

828
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:35,802
A NEW PART OF YOUR WARDROBE.

829
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:38,972
>> WELL, THIS WAS BIG JON'S SHOE

830
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,557
THAT HE LEFT BEHIND, AND SO I

831
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,100
DECIDED THAT I COULD KIND OF CUT

832
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:43,768
IT AND SO I COULD HAVE AT LEAST

833
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,645
A FOOTHOLD SO I COULD AT LEAST

834
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:46,813
STAND, AND IT LOOKS LIKE TODAY I

835
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,732
MIGHT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE.

836
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:49,858
>> Jeff: YOU FEEL GOOD ENOUGH

837
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,860
TO COMPETE IN THIS ONE.

838
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:52,902
>> I'M GOING TO DO IT.

839
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,362
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS

840
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,656
READY TO GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY

841
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,032
CHALLENGE?

842
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:57,615
>> YES.

843
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,409
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,

844
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:05,874
NATALIE, TAKE BACK THE NECKLACE.

845
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,834
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

846
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:08,585
FOR GRABS.

847
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,128
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE

848
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:13,381
GOING TO USE TWO VERY SMALL

849
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,507
PADDLES TO MANEUVER A BALL

850
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:17,677
THROUGH A SERIES OF OBSTACLES.

851
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,554
IF AT ANY POINT THE BALL DROPS,

852
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:21,306
YOU GOTTA GO BACK TO THE START.

853
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:24,809

STEP AWAY FROM FINAL TRIBAL

857
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:34,944
COUNCIL.

858
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:35,945
LOSERS, SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED

859
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,113
OUT AND BECOME THE SEVENTH

860
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:40,367
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

861
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,285
STAKES GET BIGGER EVERY SINGLE

862
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:42,452
DAY.

863
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:43,411
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS.

864
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,998
WE'LL GET STARTED.

865
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,836
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

867
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,466

869
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:09,687
GO.

870
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,189
BIG LEARNING CURVE OUT OF THE

871
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:11,523
GATE.

872
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:12,982
TAKES A LOT OF TOUCH.

873
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,901
YOU ONLY GET THAT TOUCH BY

874
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:22,575
PRACTICING AGAIN AND AGAIN.

875
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,993
YOU'RE GOING TO DROP THAT BALL A

876
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:24,786
LOT IN THE BEGINNING.

877
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,913
DON'T LET THAT WORRY YOU.

878
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,290
DON'T GET FRUSTRATED.

879
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:33,962
JUST KEEP GOING.

880
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,590
MISSY DOING A NICE JOB.

881
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:42,262
BAYLOR DOING A NICE JOB.

882
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,930
KEITH DROPS.

883
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,306
JACLYN STILL AT THE FRONT,

884
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,392
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET

885
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:51,146
THAT BALL MOVING.

886
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:56,443
MISSY GETTING SOME MOMENTUM NOW.

887
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,069
KEITH DROPS AGAIN.

888
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:58,987
KEITH HAD AN ADVANTAGE IN THIS

889
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,279
CHALLENGE.

890
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:02,949
THE QUESTION IS DID IT HELP?

891
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,326
YOU DON'T WANT TO PAN NICK THIS

892
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,494
CHALLENGE BECAUSE ANYTHING CAN

893
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,663
HAPPEN.

894
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:09,581
MISSY DROPS.

895
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:10,540
SHE'S GOT TO GO BACK.

896
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:11,833
JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU HAVE IT

897
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,585
FIGURED OUT, YOU LOSE YOUR BALL

898
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,420
AND YOU GOTTA START AGAIN.

899
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:16,713
BAYLOR HALFWAY THROUGH WITH HER

900
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:17,714
FIRST BALL.

901
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:24,554
IF SHE CAN KEEP IT ALIVE.

902
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:25,388
BAYLOR DROPS.

903
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:25,889
SHE'S GOT TO START OVER.

904
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:33,271
KEITH WORKING ON HIS FIRST BALL.

905
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:41,905
KEITH WITH A NICE SAVE.

906
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,865
KEITH NOW STARTING TO MAKE SOME

907
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,659
PROGRESS.

908
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:47,994
KEITH DOING A NICE JOB.

909
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:51,789
HE'S GOT HIS BALL ON THE FINAL

910
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:52,957
OBSTACLE.

911
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,959
KEITH VERY CLOSE.

912
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:58,379
IF HE CAN GET IT UP TOP AND

913
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,048
DROPPED, IT GETS VERY TRICKY AT

914
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:05,261
THE END.

915
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,347
KEITH HAS HIS FIRST BALL

916
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:07,555
THROUGH.

917
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:08,348
TWO TO GO.

918
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,642
THERE ARE THREE BALLS TOTAL YOU

919
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,185
HAVE TO TRANSFER.

920
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,729
KEITH HAS ONE.

921
00:30:14,812 --> 00:30:15,897
EVERYBODY ELSE STILL TRYING TO

922
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,066
FIGURE IT OUT.

923
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,901
JACLYN TRYING TO GET A KEY.

924
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,069
SHE'S LOOKING OVER AT KEITH.

925
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,570
WHAT IS HE DOING?

926
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:26,032
WHAT DOES HE KNOW THAT I DON'T

927
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:26,699
KNOW?

928
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,117
IS THAT ADVANTAGE HELPING KEITH?

929
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:31,996
IT WOULD APPEAR SO.

930
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,998
JACLYN STILL WORKING AT THE

931
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:39,212
FIRST OBSTACLE.

932
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,797
KEITH WHIPPING THROUGH THIS

933

1009
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,252
VERY TALL ORDER.

1010
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,336
I'VE NEVER GOTTEN A CHALLENGE ON

00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:44,118
COMING BACK TO CAMP AFTER THE

1120
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:46,120
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, WASN'T TOO

1121
00:36:46,203 --> 00:36:46,287
BAD.

1122
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,664
YOU KNOW, TONIGHT PROBABLY WON'T

1123
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:48,956
BE TOO HARD.

1124
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,293
I MEAN, JACLYN KNOWS, SHE'S

1125
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,377
GOING RIGHT UP THERE TO THE

1126
00:36:53,461 --> 00:37:06,557
JURY.

1127
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,475
>> I MEAN--

1128
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,559
>> BEST CAN BE EXPECTED?

1129
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,395
>> YEAH.

1130
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,688
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1131
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,023
SHE'S GOING TO GET TO HAVE HER

1132
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:14,857
NICE BOTTLE OF WINE.

1133
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:15,441
>> OH, YEAH.

1134
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,943
>> I THINK JABLIN IS READY TO

1135
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:17,109
GO.

1136
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,445
>> YEAH.

1137
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:23,157
>> SO ARE YOU STILL VOTING WITH

1138
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:23,491
THEM?

1139
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,785
>> I AM BEING TOTALLY REAL RIGHT

1140
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:26,661
NOW, IF YOU WANT TO VOTE ONE OF

1141
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,079
THEM OUT AND DOWN, I WOULDN'T

1142
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,372
VOTE YOU OUT TOMORROW I WOULDN'T

1143
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,289
VOTE YOU OUT TOMORROW.

1144
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,458
YOU GUYS WOULD PROBABLY VOTE MY

1145
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,669
ASS OUT TOMORROW.

1146
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,379
IT WILL BE ONE MORE DAY FOR ME.

1147
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,047
THAT'S MY WHOLE THING, ONE MORE

1148
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:38,214
DAY.

1149
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,924
I JUST WENT THROUGH A WHIRLWIND

1150
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,385
TWO DAYS, JON BEING VOTED OFF,

1151
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:42,927
FEELING ALONE AFTER THAT.

1152
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,012
THEN GOING TO EXILE, FEELING

1153
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,098
MORE ISOLATED AND I'M COMING

1154
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,349
BACK HERE AND I KNOW I'M GOING

1155
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,935
HOME AND IT SUCKS, AND I'M LIKE,

1156
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,687
NO, I'M NOT GOING TO LAY DOWN.

1157
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,522
>> WHAT WOULD DO YOU TODAY?

1158
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,356
>> I FEEL LIKE MISSY?

1159
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:58,109
JUST BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE BAYLOR

1160
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,485
DISW WHATEVER HER MOM TELLS HER.

1161
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,612
>> I MEAN, LISTEN, I FEEL REALLY

1162
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,947
SECURE WITH MISSY AND BAYLOR,

1163
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,117
LIKE, I TRUST THEM 100%.

1164
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,576
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,

1165
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,746
THEY'RE BLOOD.

1166
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,623
>> ME AND MY MOM ARE NOT VOTING

1167
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:13,457
FOR YOU.

1168
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,083
>> YEAH.

1169
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:14,750
>> YOU KNOW THAT.

1170
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:15,001
>> YEAH.

1171
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,627
>> I WAS THINKING TONIGHT,

1172
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,463
YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY YOUR IDOL,

1173
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:19,672
RIGHT?

1174
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:20,089
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO.

1175
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,382
>> PLAY IT FOR MY MOM.

1176
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,426
>> I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO

1177
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,969
PLAY IT FOR YOU, HONESTLY.

1178
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:25,344
>> THAT'S FINE.

1179
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,637
I KNOW I'M IN THE FINAL FOUR

1180
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:27,555
BECAUSE OF MY IDOL.

1181
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,432
I ALSO KNOW THAT MISSY AND

1182
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,767
BAYLOR PROBABLY WON'T VOTE ME

1183
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,937
OFF BECAUSE THEY FEEL CONFIDENT.

1184
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:35,980
WE'RE SO TIGHT.

1185
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:38,232
WE TRUST EACH OTHER.

1186
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:40,693
>> NO ONE IS VOTING FOR YOU

1187
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:42,236
KEITH'S NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR

1188
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:42,403
YOU.

1189
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,863
HE'S GOING TO VOTE FOR JACLYN

1190
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,740
WITH US EVERYONE IS ON JACLYN.

1191
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:46,574
AND JACLYN WILL VOTE MISSY.

1192
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,118
>> ONE THING IS FOR SURE BIG

1193
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,286
MOVES DO WIN THIS GAME, AND I

1194
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:51,579
FEEL LIKE I'VE DONE MOVES THAT

1195
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:55,624
HAVEN'T BEEN AS IMPACTFUL AS I'D

1196
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:55,916
LIKE.

1197
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,917
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE

1198
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,294
AT THIS POINT.

1199
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:02,965
I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT MYSELF.

1200
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,508
IT'S EITHER MAKING A BIG MOVE

1201
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,011
TODAY, GETTING RID OF BAYLOR OR

1202
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,804
MISSY, AND RISKING LOSING ITAL

1203
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,431
AND NOT MAKING FINAL THREE, OR

1204
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,641
KIND OF PLAYING IT SAFE AND VOTE

1205
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:17,021
OUT JACLYN.

1206
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:17,605
THAT'S THE ONLY FEAR THEY HAVE

1207
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,107
IS THAT PEOPLE WILL BE LIKE,

1208
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,318
"LOOK AT THE MOVE NATALIE MADE.

1209
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,736
AM PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS SCARED OF

1210
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,071
PEOPLE WHO MAKE BIG MOVES.

1211
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:26,405
IF I DID SOMETHING BIG TONIGHT,

1212
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:26,947
TOMORROW, I COULD BE THE ONE

1213
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,533
GOING HOME.

1214
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:34,705
SCARY.

1215
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:50,930
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

1216
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:55,267
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1217
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,268
JOSH.

1218
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,561
JEREMY.

1219
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:57,728
WES.

1220
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,231
REED.

1221
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:00,439
ALEC.

1222
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,651
AND JON, VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

1223
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,946
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1224
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,615
SO, JACLYN, HOW IS YOUR GAME

1225
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:12,243
DIFFERENT NOW THAT JON IS OUT?

1226
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,619
>> PROS, OBVIOUSLY, YOU DON'T

1227
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,204
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE OTHER

1228
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:15,579
PERSON.

1229
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,206
CONS, YOU HAVE NO ONE YOU CAN

1230
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,499
TRUST 100%.

1231
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,334
SO IT'S LIKE I'M TRYING TO

1232
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:22,002
FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO NOW WHEN

1233
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,712
THE ONLY PERSON I REALLY TRUSTED

1234
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,339
IS GONE.

1235
00:40:25,422 --> 00:40:26,173
>> Jeff: KEITH, WHAT WAS THE

1236
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,299
REACTION WHEN YOU GOT BACK TO

1237
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,634
CAMP AFTER THE LAST TRIBAL

1238
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:28,843
COUNCIL?

1239
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,511
>> IT GOT HEATED.

1240
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,012
IT GOT LOUD.

1241
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,681
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE A

1242
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,015
CAT FIGHT.

1243
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,684
I MEAN, HAIR PULLING.

1244
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:37,685
IT GOT HEATED.

1245
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,395
BUT I NEVER HEARD MY NAME, SO --

1246
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:40,688
>> SO THAT WOULD MAKE IT GOOD

1247
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:41,647
NEWS FOR YOU.

1248
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,690
>> WRONGER THAT.

1249
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:43,566
YUP.

1250
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:44,650
THAT'S IT.

1251
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:47,069
>> Jeff: MISSY, FINAL FIVE,

1252
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,737
LAST TIME YOU CAN USE AN IDOL IF

1253
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:49,864
YOU HAVE IT.

1254
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,490
WHAT'S THE SPHEELG BECAUSE VERY

1255
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,325
FEW HAVE BEEN PLAYED, AND ALWAYS

1256
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,034
AT SURPRISING TIMES.

1257
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:54,618
>> I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT ABOUT

1258
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,955
THE IDOL SITUATION BECAUSE I

1259
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:01,792
KNOW WHO HAS IT.

1260
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,377
>> Jeff: JACLYN, WHAT DO YOU

1261
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,589
READ INTO THAT?

1262
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:07,173
MISSY'S SAYING I'M CONFIDENT

1263
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,549
ABOUT THE IDOL SITUATION BECAUSE

1264
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:09,675
I KNOW WHO HAS IT.

1265
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:10,009
>> IT'S CRAZY.

1266
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,428
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THERE WAS

1267
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,430
ANISEED ANISEED ON HERE.

1268
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:15,389
>> DON'T BE WHO HAS IT.

1269
00:41:15,472 --> 00:41:17,516
>> SO I'M THINKING SHE OR

1270
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,684
NATALIE OR BAYLOR MAY HAVE IT,

1271
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,686
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING

1272
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:21,145
ABOUT IT.

1273
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,480
>> Jeff: SO THAT WOULD MAKE IT

1274
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:24,023
POTENTIALLY WORSE FOR YOU.

1275
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,649
>> YEAH.

1276
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,235
>> Jeff: MISSY, ANY CONCERN

1277
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:33,574
AT NOW I, AS THE FINAL LOVED ONE

1278
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:34,700
PAIR STILL IN THE GAME, NOW IT

1279
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:35,868
BECOMES A LIABILITY.

1280
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,119
IF BOTH OF YOU COULD MAKE IT TO

1281
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,621
THE END, IT'S A PRETTY GOOD

1282
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:38,954
STORY.

1283
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,122
>> I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE WE'RE

1284
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,333
PROBABLY IN A DANGER ZONE BUT I

1285
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,710
DO FEEL PRETTY STRONGLY THAT I

1286
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,921
STILL HAVE AN ALIGNMENT THAT'S

1287
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:47,546
STUCK LIKE GLUE.

1288
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,714
>> Jeff: NATALIE, WHAT WAS THE

1289
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:50,925
VIBE AT CAMP TODAY AFTER KEITH

1290
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,509
WON IMMUNITY AND YOU KNEW IT WAS

1291
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,095
GOING TO BE YOU, JACLYN, MISSY,

1292
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,639
OR BAYLOR GOING HOME TONIGHT?

1293
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,557
>> IT TAKES ONE PERSON OFF THE

1294
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,434
CHOPPING BLOCK AND THE REST OF

1295
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,727
US ARE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

1296
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,103
WHAT TO DO.

1297
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,356
EVERYONE ASSUMES ME, MISSY AND

1298
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,899
BAYLOR ARE VOTING TOGETHER, BUT

1299
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,067
THERE WERE SOME DISCUSSIONS THAT

1300
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:08,734
HAPPENED, JACLYN CAME TO ME AND

1301
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:10,611
PLUS KEITH WINNING IMMUNITY, YOU

1302
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:11,737
KNOW, IT MAKES EVERYTHING SO

1303
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,614
MUCH MORE COMPLICATED.

1304
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,241
>> Jeff: JACLYN, WAS KEITH THE

1305
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,825
NEXT TO GO IF HE DIDN'T WIN?

1306
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,452
>> AS FAR AS I KNOW, YEAH.

1307
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:19,620
SO IT WAS KIND OF A TOSS-UP

1308
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:23,165
BETWEEN KEITH OR MYSELF, WHICH

1309
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:23,374
SUCKS.

1310
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:24,875
>> Jeff: BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT

1311
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:25,542
KEITH, THEN--

1312
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,127
>> THEN IT'S ME.

1313
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,587
LIKE NATALIE SAID, I CAME TO

1314
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:28,754
HER.

1315
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,130
I'M LIKE, "WHAT CAN I DO?

1316
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:30,673
I'M SERIOUSLY AT THE BOTTOM.

1317
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:33,384
IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY WE CAN

1318
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:33,717
DO ANYTHING?"

1319
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,220
>> Jeff: MISSY, IS THERE

1320
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:38,764
ANYTHING JACLYN COULD DO IN THIS

1321
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:39,014
POSITION?

1322
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,183
>> I THINK THAT THERE COULD

1323
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,518
ALWAYS BE CRACKS IN THIS GAME.

1324
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,270
I THINK IN OUR PARTICULAR

1325
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,397
SITUATION, THERE AREN'T, AND SO

1326
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,731
I COMPLETELY RESPECT AND HONOR

1327
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:48,899
HER FOR TRYING, BUT SOMETIMES I

1328
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,317
THINK AFTER YOU SWING AS HARD AS

1329
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,902
YOU CAN, I MEAN, YOU DO JUST

1330
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,029
KIND OF HAVE TO SHRUG YOUR

1331
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,615
SHOULDERS AND GO OKAY, WELL, YOU

1332
00:42:56,699 --> 00:43:04,957
KNOW-- I MEAN, THIS IS MY TIME.

1333
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:05,916
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME

1334
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,625
TO VOTE.

1335
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:18,554
KEITH, YOU'RE UP.

1336
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:19,138
>> IT WAS REALLY FUN PLAYING

1337
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,014
WITH YOU.

1338
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:31,817
I HOPE YOU DON'T TAKE THIS TOO

1339
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:32,651
PERSONAL.

1340
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,069
>> NATALIE TOLD ME TO DO THIS

1341
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:34,653
AND TO JUST TRUST HER.

1342
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,822
IF IT'S NOT YOU, IT'S GOING TO

1343
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:37,614
BE ME.

1344
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,283
SO HOPEFULLY I CAN TRUST

1345
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:47,833
NATALIE.

1346
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:50,669
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1347
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:55,507
VOTES.

1348
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:58,761
IT IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN

1349
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:00,429
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO

1350
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:02,556
PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME

1351
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:03,140
TO DO SO.

1352
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,725
>> YEAH.

1353
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:05,809
I GUESS IT'S TIME TO PULL THE

1354
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:15,069
IDOL OUT OF THE BAG.

1355
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,987
I WAS GOING TO PLAY THIS FOR

1356
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:21,325
MYSELF TONIGHT, BUT IT'S MORE

1357
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:22,618
FUN WHEN YOU PLAY THEM FOR

1358
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,703
SOMEBODY ELSE.

1359
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:25,996
JACLYN, DID YOU VOTE FOR WHO I

1360
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:31,668
TOLD YOU TO VOTE FOR?

1361
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,921
I'M PLAYING THIS FOR JAC.

1362
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:40,302
>> Jeff: OKAY.

1363
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:41,512
>> I KNEW I LIKED HER.

1364
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:45,099
I KNEW I LIKED HER.

1365
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,683
>> I'M GOING HOME.

1366
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:47,559
LOVE YOU.

1367
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:52,648
>> I LOVE YOU.

1368
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:55,025
>> Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN

1369
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:55,734
IMMUNITY IDOL.

1370
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,736
ANY VOTES CAST FOR JACLYN WILL

1371
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,529
NOT COUNT.

1372
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:03,951
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1373
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:06,078
JACLYN.

1374
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:09,748
DOES NOT COUNT.

1375
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:09,957
JACLYN.

1376
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,378
DOES NOT COUNT.

1377
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:23,887
JACLYN, DOES NOT COUNT.

1378
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:24,138
BAYLOR.

1379
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,848
THAT'S ONE VOTE BAYLOR, ONE VOTE

1380
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:32,855
LEFT.

1381
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,648
13th PERSON VOTED OUT AND

1382
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:36,650
THE SEVENTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

1383
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:38,068
BAYLOR, YOU NEED TO BRING ME

1384
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:38,694
YOUR TORCH.

1385
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:39,820
>> I LOVE YOU, MOMMY.

1386
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:40,904
GIVE ME A HUG.

1387
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,991
I LOVE YOU.

1388
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,951
>> I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

1389
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:47,744
>> I LOVE YOU.

1390
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:53,333
>> HANG IN THERE.

1391
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,294
>> Jeff: BAYLOR, THE TRIBE HAS

1392
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:57,880
SPOKEN.

1393
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:01,008
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1394
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:11,518
>> LOVE YOU ALL.

1395
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,645
>> Jeff: NATALIE, JACLYN,

1396
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:14,271
MISSY, KEITH, YOU'VE MADE IT TO

1397
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:15,772
THE FINAL FOUR.

1398
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:16,815
TOMORROW YOU WILL COMPETE IN

1399
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,276
YOUR FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

1400
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,944
TRY TO GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP

1401
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,029
BECAUSE ARE YOU DEFINITELY GOING

1402
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,156
TO NEED IT.

1403
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,158
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO

1404
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:26,366
CAMP.

1405
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:33,040
GOOD NIGHT.

1406
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,918
>> I FEEL SURPRISED.

1407
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:39,421
THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD

1408
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:39,713
BLINDSIDE.

1409
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,131
I'M SUPER PROUD OF MYSELF.

1410
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,050
I'M NOT MAD AT NATALIE.

1411
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:46,929
THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD MOVE.

1412
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:53,352
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

1413
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,187
>> Jeff: WELL THAT WAS ONE OF

1414
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,481
THE BIGGEST MOVES THE SEASON.

1415
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:58,106
THAT IS HOW YOU PLAY "SURVIVOR,"

1416
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,776
AND IT IS MOVES LIKE THAT, I

1417
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,236
THINK ARE ONE OF THE BIG REASONS

1418
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,487
WHY I HEAR THE SAME THING OVER

1419
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:04,821
AND OVER WHEN YOU GUYS STOP ME

1420
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,782
ON THE STREET TO TALK

1421
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:07,824
"SURVIVOR," WHICH I LOVE, AND

1422
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,451
THAT IS IS.

1423
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,703
>> NEVER MISAN EPISODE.

1424
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:14,456
>> NEVER MISS AN EPISODE.

1425
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,124
>> WATCH IT AND REWATCH IT.

1426
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:17,334
>> Jeff: ALL OF YOU HAVE

1427
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:18,544
WATCHED EVERY SINGLE EPISODE.

1428
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:19,920
AND THIS IS NOT UNCOMMON.

1429
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:23,048
WE VETERAN ON 29 SEASONS.

1430
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:24,925
THAT'S 400-SOME HOURS DEDICATED

1431
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,261
TO THIS OVER 15 YEARS.

1432
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,929
WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE SHOW THAT

1433
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,514
KEEPS YOU COMING BACK?

1434
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,891
WE WERE IN A LONG-DISTANCE

1435
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:36,144
RELATIONSHIP AND IT MADE

1436
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:36,436
"SURVIVOR."

1437
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,855
>> IT WAS OUR DATE NIGHT.

1438
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:38,689
>> Jeff: DO YOU WATCH WITH

1439
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:38,855
MOM?

1440
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:39,690
>> YES.

1441
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:40,315
>> WEDNESDAY NIGHT, OUR NIGHT IS

1442
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,818
GIRL NIGHT, GIRL POWER.

1443
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:43,902
>> Jeff: YOU HAVE GIRL POWER

1444
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:44,945
GOING ON RIGHT THERE.

1445
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:45,404
ARE YOU GUYS TOGETHER?

1446
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:47,948
>> WE WATCH IT AND REWATCH IT.

1447
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,116
>> Jeff: YOU REWATCH IT?

1448
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,450
>> ONCE A YEAR WE START AT

1449
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:50,909
SEASON ONE --

1450
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:53,370
>> OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE NUTS.

1451
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:55,289
>> I'VE HAD A LOT OF CHANGES,

1452
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,332
CHANGED CAREERS, CHANGED

1453
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,625
BOYFRIENDS, BUT "SURVIVOR" IS

1454
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,127
THE ONE CONSTANT FOR ME.

1455
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,671
>> I TAPED IT EVERY WEEK ON VHS,

1456
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:03,797
AND ONE NIGHT I HAD A DATE IN

1457
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,799
COLLEGE AND HAD TO CANCEL

1458
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:06,383
CAUSE IT WAS THURSDAY

1459
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:07,593
NIGHT.

1460
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:08,802
>> Jeff: THAT'S "SURVIVOR,"

1461
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:10,512
THAT'S LOVE RIGHT THERE.

1462
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:11,722
NATALIE JUST PULLED OFF A BIG

1463
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,724
MOVE AND NOW SHE HAS TO GO BACK

1464
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,225
TO CAMP AND DEAL WITH THE

1465
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:15,475
FALLOUT.

1466
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,060
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO LOOKED

1467
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:21,898
FOR TO.

1468
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,001
>> WHEN I WALKED INTO TRIBAL, I

1469
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,170
HAD AN IMMUNITY IDOL AND MY PLAN

1470
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,839
WAS BASICALLY DECIDING KEEPING

1471
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:48,675
BAYLOR AROUND OR JACLYN AROUND.

1472
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,552
TRUSTING TWO FAMILY MEMBERS IN A

1473
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,512
SITUATION WHERE I COULD BE THE

1474
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,264
OUTSIDER JUST SEEMED LIKE A

1475
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:54,765
REALLY DANGEROUS THING.

1476
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:57,059
SO BAYLOR WENT HOME.

1477
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,478
>> THAT WAS PRETTY SLICK.

1478
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,271
I MEAN, IT'S SHOWTIME NOW.

1479
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,523
>> AT ONE POINT, YOU'VE GOT TO

1480
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,942
REALIZE IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL'S

1481
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:06,151
GAME.

1482
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,235
MAKING THIS MOVE, I REALIZE THAT

1483
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,155
I CAN GET RID OF A COUPLE BUT

1484
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:13,742
NOT BE THE MAIN THREAT.

1485
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:15,494
IF KEITH WINS TOMORROW, HE'LL

1486
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:18,038
PROBABLY WANT TO VOTE OUT MISSY

1487
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,456
OVER ME.

1488
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:20,749
THIS WAY I GET TO GO TO THE

1489
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:22,292
FINAL THREE AND I'M NOT JUST

1490
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,251
PUTTING MY FATE IN MISSY'S AND

1491
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:24,002
BAYLOR'S HANDS, AND MISSY'S CASE

1492
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,129
IN FINAL THREE IS SO MUCH

1493
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:29,049
STRONGER SITTING NEXT TO BAYLOR

1494
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,385
THAN WITHOUT BAYLOR.

1495
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:36,682
>> NO.

1496
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:37,057
IT'S A GAME.

1497
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,435
I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.

1498
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,061
IT WOULD HAVE MADE ME NERVOUS,

1499
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,814
TOO, TO HAVE YOU AND YOUR

1500
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:44,564
SISTER.

1501
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:45,190
>> YEAH.

1502
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:46,108
>> AH!

1503
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:48,985
IT DIDN'T GO AS PLANNED.

1504
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:51,363
UM, SO, BAYLOR GOT VOTED OUT.

1505
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:54,032
YOU KNOW, IT'S A GAME.

1506
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,659
AND, I MEAN, I'M OKAY WITH IT

1507
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,869
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TO WRITE MY

1508
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,579
CHILD'S NAME DOWN ON A VOTING

1509
00:49:59,663 --> 00:49:59,788
BALLOT.

1510
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,039
I MEAN, IT'S A RELIEF, AND IT'S

1511
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:04,126
A LIFT OFF MY SHOULDERS.

1512
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:04,251
>>

1513
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:05,585
>> THIS IS THE ONLY THING I HAVE

1514
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:06,002
EVER KEPT FROM YOU.

1515
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,170
>> I KNOW, I UNDERSTAND.

1516
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,297
YOU HAVE TOLD ME MORE THAN

1517
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,674
ANYBODY ELSE HAS COME CLOSE TO

1518
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:11,550
TELLING ME THIS THIS GAME.

1519
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,301
I MEAN, I GUESS THE FATE OF MY

1520
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:17,347
GAME IS IN THESE OTHER PEOPLE'S

1521
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,141
HANDS BECAUSE I CAN'T COMPETE.

1522
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:22,811
>> IT'S OKAY.

1523
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,312
>> WELL, THANKS FOR GIVING ME

1524
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:25,897
LIFE ONE MORE DAYS BECAUSE OF

1525
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:26,064
YOU.

1526
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,649
>> IF KEITH WINS IMMUNITY

1527
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:28,191
TOMORROW, I WON'T HAVE ANY

1528
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:28,442
CHANCE.

1529
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:31,945
>> OBVIOUSLY, YOU DID THE SMART

1530
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:32,112
THING.

1531
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:32,738
TONIGHT AT TRIBAL I THOUGHT I

1532
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:34,489
WAS GOING HOME, AND NATALIE

1533
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:35,240
TOTALLY STEPPED IN AND SAVED MY

1534
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:35,449
LIFE.

1535
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,159
>> IT'S BETWEEN ME AND YOU

1536
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,618
TOMORROW FOR THE IMMUNITY.

1537
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:45,292
>> YEAH, WE GOT IT.

1538
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,210
>> I NEED TO WIN IMMUNITY

1539
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:47,461
TOMORROW.

1540
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:52,048
AND IF I DON'T AND NATALIE DOES,

1541
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,383
SHE'S TAKING ME AND MISSY TO THE

1542
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:59,014
FINAL THREE.

1543
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,310
>> KEITH IS THE NUMBER ONE

1544
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,895
THREAT RIGHT NOW, SO THE GOAL IS

1545
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:06,813
TO NOT LET KEITH WIN SO WE CAN

1546
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:07,230
VOTE HIM OUT NEXT.

1547
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,691
>> YEAH, KEITH IS SCARY.

1548
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:13,487
>> KEITH IS SCARY.

1549
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:42,849
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

1550
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,851
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO YOUR

1551
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:45,352
FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

1552
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:46,311
>> YES.

1553
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:47,562
>> YES.

1554
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:48,146
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,

1555
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,982
KEITH, TAKE BACK THE NECKLACE.

1556
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:51,858
>> OH, MAN.

1557
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,236
>> Jeff: HATE TO GIVE THAT UP,

1558
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:54,402
HUH?

1559
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:57,155
>> I DO, I DO.

1560
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,657
>> Jeff: THE LAST TIME

1561
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,992
IMMUNITY IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.

1562
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:01,576
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE

1563
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:07,666
GOING TO RACE DOWN A GIANT

1564
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:08,333
TOWER.

1565
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,334
YOU'LL THEN MANEUVER THROUGH A

1566
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:11,336
SERIES OF OBSTACLES, COLLECTING

1567
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:14,130
BAGS OF PUZZLE PIECES AS YOU GO.

1568
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,298
ONCE YOU HAVE THE FIRST THREE

1569
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,592
BAGS, YOU'LL HEAD BACK TO THE

1570
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:19,052
TOP, DROP THEM, HEAD BACK DOWN

1571
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:20,178
AND GET THE OTHER TWO.

1572
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:22,764
YOU WILL THEN USE THOSE PUZZLE

1573
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:23,306
PIECES TO SOLVE A PUZZLE.

1574
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,642
BUT THERE'S A TWIST.

1575
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:27,602
WHEN YOUR PUZZLE'S COMPLETE,

1576
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:30,856
THREE PIECES WILL BE MISSING.

1577
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:33,859
THE SHAPES OF THOSE PIECES WILL

1578
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,193
REVEAL THE THREE NUMBERS YOU

1579
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:38,572
NEED TO SOLVE THE COMBINATION

1580
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:41,241
LOCK.

1581
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,827
FIRST PERSON TO GET IT RIGHT AND

00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:46,997

00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:54,421
CASE ABOUT WHY YOU DESERVE THE

00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,423
TITLE OF "SOLE SURVIVOR" AND THE

1587
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,508
MILLION DOLLARS THAT GOES WITH

1588
00:52:58,592 --> 00:52:59,259
IT.

1589
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,927
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL, WHERE

SO, MISSY, OBVIOUS QUESTION--

00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:11,605
LOOKING AT THE SIZE OF THIS

1595
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,565
CHALLENGE, I DON'T SEE ANY WAY

1596
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:15,317
YOU CAN PARTICIPATE GIVEN THE

1597
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,151
SHAPE YOU'RE IN.

1598
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:17,402
>> YEAH, I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S

1599
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:18,486
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

1600
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,113

01:01:57,338 --> 01:01:59,549
SOMEBODY GOING HOME TONIGHT,

1849
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:00,591
SOMEBODY WILL BECOME THE EIGHTH

1850
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:01,384
AND FINAL MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

1851
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:03,594
YOU HAVE THE AFTERNOON TO FIGURE

1852
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:04,971
OUT WHO IT'S GOING TO BE.

1853
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:05,304
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

1854
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,723
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1855
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,225
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL

1856
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:09,475
COUNCIL.

1857
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:09,725
CONGRATS.

1858
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,102
>> THAT WAS A TOUGH ONE.

1859
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:14,397
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, JACLYN WON.

1860
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:14,939
NATALIE SAVED JACLYN LAST

1861
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:16,941
TRIBAL, SO I SEE NO REASON WHY

1862
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:20,027
JACLYN SHOULD GET RID OF

1863
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:20,278
NATALIE.

1864
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:21,362
THAT MEANS TROUBLE FOR ME IS

1865
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:22,155
WHAT IT MEANS.

1866
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:29,912
BIG TROUBLE.

1867
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,887
>> OH, MY GOD.

1868
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,430
>> THAT WAS, LIKE, THE HARDEST.

1869
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:52,351
>> HARDEST CHALLENGE EVER.

1870
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:53,686
>> THAT'S THE DAY TO WIN.

1871
01:02:53,769 --> 01:02:55,021
>> THAT'S THE BIGGIE.

1872
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:56,439
YOU ANTICIPATE KIDDING.

1873
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:59,108
>> JON IS GOING TO DIE WHEN HE

1874
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:00,651
SEES ME WEARING THE NECKLACE

1875
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:01,068
TONIGHT.

1876
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:01,819
I CAN'T WAIT.

1877
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:01,986
OH!

1878
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:04,530
I DIDN'T WIN ONE IMMUNITY

1879
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:05,656
CHALLENGE THE WHOLE GAME, AND I

1880
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:06,908
WON THE FREAKING MOST IMPORTANT

1881
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:07,074
ONE.

1882
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,784
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

1883
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:09,994
I'M NOT TAKING THIS OFF.

1884
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:11,704
>> DON'T.

1885
01:03:11,787 --> 01:03:14,081
I WOULD BE SPAING OUT IF I WAS

1886
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:14,248
YOU.

1887
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:15,583
>> TONIGHT I HAVE A HUGE

1888
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:15,875
DECISION.

1889
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,418
WHO TO TAKE TO THE FINAL THREE.

1890
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,337
I LIKE TO TALK EVERYTHING OUT.

1891
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:20,671
THAT'S HOW ME AND JON PLAYED THE

1892
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,131
WHOLE GAME, JUST TALKING

1893
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,508
EVERYTHING OUT, EVERY SCENARIO

1894
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:23,925
WE COULD THINK OF.

1895
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:26,594
AND ULTIMATELY IT COULD BE A

1896
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:27,637
MILLION-DOLLAR DECISION.

1897
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,389
IT COULD BE A MILLION-DOLLAR

1898
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:30,598
MISTAKE.

1899
01:03:30,681 --> 01:03:31,933
>> CAN I PLEAD MY CASE RIGHT

1900
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:32,099
NOW?

1901
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:33,976
YOU'RE WHO I NEED TO BE TALKING

1902
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:34,852
TO JAC.

1903
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:37,021
SHE'S THE POWER, SHE'S THE MAN.

1904
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:39,065
>> WHOEVER WINS THE NECKLACE HAS

1905
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:39,565
THE POWER.

1906
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:40,983
>> YOU TRY TO MAKE A PITCH TO

1907
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:41,817
GET TO THE MILLION.

1908
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:44,820
AND DAY 39, YOU'RE PITCHING WHY

1909
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:48,449
YOU DESERVE THE MILLION.

1910
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:50,284
I'VE GOT TO GET IN THE FINAL

1911
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:50,493
THREE.

1912
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:51,077
I'M THINKING YOU GOT A BETTER

1913
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,829
CHANCE WITH ME AND NAT INSTEAD

1914
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:57,166
OF MISSY AND NAT.

1915
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,918
MISSY'S GONNA GET A LOT OF

1916
01:03:59,001 --> 01:03:59,085
VOTES.

1917
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:00,628
SHE'S GOING TO GET THE SYMPATHY

1918
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:03,631
VOTE FOR HER ANKLE-- SOME.

1919
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:05,216
SHE'S GOT BAYLOR LAWYER ALREADY.

1920
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:06,175
>> THAT MAKES SENSE.

1921
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:08,427
>> I GIVE JACLYN MY PITCH.

1922
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:10,388
IF JACLYN GETS RID OF MISSY,

1923
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:11,514
SHE'S GOT A BETTER CHANCE WITH

1924
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:12,932
ME IN THE THREE THAN MISSY.

1925
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,517
HOPEFULLY, SHE'LL VISUALIZE THAT

1926
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,893
AND SEE.

1927
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:17,562
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY.

1928
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:19,355
IT'S IN Y'ALL'S HANDS.

1929
01:04:19,438 --> 01:04:20,731
THINK ABOUT IT JACLYN.

1930
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:23,526
>> I WILL.

1931
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:25,361
>> SO, I MEAN, IT'S OBVIOUSLY ME

1932
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:26,487
AND YOU.

1933
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:28,197
AND ONE OF THEM.

1934
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:30,533
>> THESE TWO ARE DANGEROUS IN

1935
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:30,908
DIFFERENT WAYS.

1936
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:31,701
>> I KNOW.

1937
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:32,994
TRYING TO OUTWEIGH THE PROS PROS

1938
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:34,537
AND CONS.

1939
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:35,871
WE SHOULD HAVE A CONVERSATION

1940
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:36,163
ABOUT THIS.

1941
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,748
>> THE PROBLEM WITH JACLYN IS

1942
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,292
SHE'S WEARING THE NECKLACE, SHE

1943
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:39,959
KNOWS SHE'S IN THE POWER SEAT.

1944
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,503
I WILL KEEP GOING AND HOPE SHE

1945
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:43,546
DOESN'T LET THIS POWER TRIP GO

1946
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:44,714
TO HER HEAD.

1947
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:45,381
OKAY, MISSY.

1948
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:47,300
>> WHO WOULD VOTE FOR MISSY.

1949
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:48,593
WE VOTE MISSY OUT.

1950
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:54,932
>> I WOULD VOTE MISSY OUT TODAY.

1951
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:56,726
BUT I THINK KEITH IS SCARER.

1952
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:57,435
I DON'T KNOW.

1953
01:04:57,518 --> 01:05:00,563
IT'S UP TO YOU.

1954
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:02,273
I DON'T WANT JACLYN THINKING TOO

1955
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:02,481
MUCH.

1956
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:03,065
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU WHAT TO

1957
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:04,942
DO WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU AND ME

1958
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:07,153
HERE AND LISTEN TO ME.

1959
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,988
LET'S GET RID OF KEITH.

1960
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,156
I SHOULDN'T SPAS OUT BUT THIS IS

1961
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,449
THE END.

1962
01:05:11,532 --> 01:05:13,534
I HAVE ROOM TO BE NERVOUS.

1963
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:18,164
I HAVE TO TALK TO MISSY, TOO,

1964
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:18,331
BUT.

1965
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:19,081
>> I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE

1966
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:21,959
KEITH FOR SURE, UNLESS SOMETHING

1967
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:24,045
HAPPENS IN MY HEAD IN THE NEXT

1968
01:05:24,128 --> 01:05:25,630
FOUR HOURS, BUT I KIND OF DOIT

1969
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:30,801
IT.

1970
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:31,385
>> I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU.

1971
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:32,345
>> OKAY?

1972
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:35,348
>> WOULD YOU EVER VOTE NAT?

1973
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:36,641
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?

1974
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:38,643
>> JACLYN, I HAVE TO BE HONEST I

1975
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:40,102
THINK IT'S A TOSS-UP.

1976
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:42,063
>> I THINK OUT OF US FOUR, SHE'S

1977
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:44,315
GOT THE STRONGEST GAME PLAY.

1978
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:46,609
THEN I'M LIKE HOLY CRAP, SHE

1979
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:48,319
GAVE ME LIFE LAST NIGHT.

1980
01:05:48,402 --> 01:05:49,779
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, SHE

1981
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:50,404
COORDINATED THE BARELY BLINDSIDE

1982
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,615
AND THE JON BLINDSIDE, AND

1983
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:54,158
THAT'S TWO HUGE PLAYS THAT BROKE

1984
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:55,159
UP THE FAB FIVE.

1985
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:57,036
THAT'S A HUGE STATEMENT.

1986
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:00,581
>> YEAH.

1987
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:03,042
>> JACLYN COMES UP AND SAYS, HOW

1988
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:04,960
WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT VOTING OUT

1989
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:05,211
NATALIE?

1990
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:07,963
MY HEAD I WENT-- UM.

1991
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:09,965
WELL, "A," NUMBER ONE, SHE VOTED

1992
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:11,759
OUT MY KID.

1993
01:06:11,842 --> 01:06:13,427
AND, "B," KEEP TALKING.

1994
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:14,178
IF YOUR GUT IS TALKING TO YOU,

1995
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:16,013
YOU NEED TO LISTEN.

1996
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:16,764
WHAT'S IT SAYING?

1997
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:17,473
I MEAN--

1998
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:18,099
>> MY GUT IS SAYING KEITH

1999
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:20,226
BECAUSE THE GUYS.

2000
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:24,939
BUT MY GUT'S ALSO SAYING NATALIE

2001
01:06:25,022 --> 01:06:27,900
COULD BEAT ME WITH THE GAME

2002
01:06:27,983 --> 01:06:28,442
PLAY.

2003
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:30,069
>> WHAT WOULD JON SAY?

2004
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:36,117
>> VOTE HER OFF.

2005
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,159
TOTAL ( BLEEP ).

2006
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:40,830
I KNOW.

2007
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:55,720
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

2008
01:06:55,803 --> 01:07:00,057
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

2009
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:01,934
JOSH.

2010
01:07:02,017 --> 01:07:03,185
JEREMY.

2011
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:04,645
WES.

2012
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:05,980
REED.

2013
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:06,814
ALEC.

2014
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:06,981
JON.

2015
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:08,107
AND BAYLOR, VOTED OUT AT THE

2016
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:14,238
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

2017
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:16,907
ALL RIGHT, SO LET'S TALK ABOUT

2018
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:18,909
TODAY.

2019
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:20,995
JACLYN, BIG FINAL IMMUNITY

2020
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:21,287
CHALLENGE.

2021
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:23,330
TELL ME ABOUT THE FEELING ON DAY

2022
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:25,541
38 KNOWING YOU ARE GUARANTEE TO

2023
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:27,126
BE HERE TOMORROW NIGHT.

2024
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:28,127
>> ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.

2025
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:29,253
I MEAN, IT'S A GOOD FEELING.

2026
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:31,964
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT'S HARD.

2027
01:07:32,047 --> 01:07:34,091
BECAUSE NOW I'M IN THE MIDDLE,

2028
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:35,217
AND I'VE TALKED TO EVERYBODY

2029
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:36,260
ABOUT DIFFERENT SCENARIOS, AND

2030
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:37,928
IT'S TOUGH.

2031
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:38,304
IT'S REALLY TOUGH.

2032
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:40,639
>> Jeff: NATALIE, LAST TRIBAL

2033
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:42,224
COUNCIL, YOU HAD AN IMMUNITY

2034
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:44,059
IDOL, YOU PLAYED IT FOR JACLYN,

2035
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:44,769
AND SAVED HER.

2036
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:47,229
DO YOU EXPECT A LITTLE

2037
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:47,772
RECIPRICATION FROM JACLYN?

2038
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:50,316
YOU SAVED HER LAST TRIBAL THAT

2039
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,692
SHE CERTAINLY WON'T VOTE FOR YOU

2040
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:51,942
TONIGHT?

2041
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:53,110
>> IT'S NICE TO THINK LIKE THAT,

2042
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:54,153
BUT I WASN'T EXPECTING IT BACK,

2043
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:56,822
BUT IT WOULD BE, OBVIOUSLY, A

2044
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,574
NICE GESTURE.

2045
01:07:58,657 --> 01:08:00,201
>> Jeff: JACLYN, DO YOU FEEL

2046
01:08:00,284 --> 01:08:02,495
AN OBLIGATION TO NATALIE TO KEEP

2047
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:04,205
HER TONIGHT, EVEN IF YOU THINK

2048
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:05,122
SHE MIGHT BEAT YOU?

2049
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:09,210
>> UM, I DO AND I DON'T.

2050
01:08:09,293 --> 01:08:12,171
I MEAN, SHE DID BLINDSIDE JON.

2051
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:15,466
THAT LEAVES A SOUR TASTE IN MY

2052
01:08:15,549 --> 01:08:16,842
MOUTH.

2053
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:17,384
>> Jeff: KEITH, WHAT WAS THE

2054
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:19,637
DAY LIKE FOR YOU?

2055
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,180
WHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE?

2056
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:23,265
>> WELL, I WENT THROUGH THE SAME

2057
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:25,017
SCENARIOS THAT EVERYBODY IS

2058
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:25,434
GOING THROUGH.

2059
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:29,688
YOU KNOW, NAT SAVED JAC LAST

2060
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:30,815
TRIBAL, SO SHE MIGHT HAVE A

2061
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:31,315
HEADS UP.

2062
01:08:31,398 --> 01:08:32,358
AND I'M THINKING IT'S GOT TO BE

2063
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:34,318
ME AND MIS, IT'S GOT TO BE.

2064
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:37,738
>> Jeff: I'M CURIOUS, MISSY,

2065
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:39,281
WHY NATALIE IS NOT IN THESE

2066
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:39,573
DISCUSSIONS.

2067
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:42,660
IS THAT BECAUSE YOU GUYS THINK

2068
01:08:42,743 --> 01:08:43,577
YOU CAN BEAT NATALIE.

2069
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:44,370
>> I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE THAT

2070
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:46,247
NATALIE IS GOING TO THE END.

2071
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:49,083
I DON'T KNOW IF KEITH HAS

2072
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:49,708
INFORMATION I DON'T KNOW ABOUT

2073
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:52,044
BUT THE THREE OF US CAN'T BE

2074
01:08:52,127 --> 01:08:52,503
COMFORTABLE TONIGHT.

2075
01:08:52,586 --> 01:08:53,587
>> Jeff: NATALIE, WHAT'S A

2076
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:55,589
REASON TO GET RID OF KEITH

2077
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:55,840
TONIGHT?

2078
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:57,007
>> EVERYBODY LOVES A FIREMAN,

2079
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:57,383
YOU KNOW.

2080
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:59,927
HE'S A REALLY CHARISMATIC GUY.

2081
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:00,511
PEOPLE ARE DRAWN TO HIM, AND

2082
01:09:00,594 --> 01:09:01,220
EVERYBODY LOVES HIM.

2083
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:04,014
>> I LIKE THAT.

2084
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:04,390
>> NICELY SAID.

2085
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:06,600
>> I LIKE THAT.

2086
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:07,643
>> Jeff: KEITH, DO YOU HAVE A

2087
01:09:07,726 --> 01:09:10,813
REASON IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO

2088
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:11,397
GET RID OF NATALIE TONIGHT?

2089
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,733
>> UM, NATALIE'S GOT A BUNCH OF

2090
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:15,568
VOTE OVER THERE.

2091
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:16,402
>> Jeff: BASED ON WHAT?

2092
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:18,529
>> WELL, BASED ON THE WAY SHE'S

2093
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:20,197
PLAYED THE GAME, GOOD, REAL

2094
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:20,406
GOOD.

2095
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:22,408
I MEAN, SHE'S A BIG THREAT.

2096
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:24,743
>> Jeff: NATALIE, YOU CAN WIN

2097
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:24,994
THIS GAME?

2098
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:26,245
>> YEAH, I THINK I COULD WIN

2099
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:26,871
THIS GAME.

2100
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:28,289
I THINK I HAVE A GOOD SHOT AT

2101
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:28,539
WINNING.

2102
01:09:28,622 --> 01:09:30,541
I REALLY DID THIS NOT ONLY FOR

2103
01:09:30,624 --> 01:09:31,375
ME, BUT FOR ME AND NADIYA.

2104
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:34,420
I WAS WITH A BUNCH OF LOVED

2105
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:34,628
ONES.

2106
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:36,338
EVERYBODY WAS COUPLED UP BUT ME.

2107
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:38,591
I JUST SAID EVEN IF IT'S HARD,

2108
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:39,842
GO THE HARD ROUTE.

2109
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:40,342
DON'T GO THE EASY ROUTE.

2110
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:42,803
AND MADE SOME RISKY DECISIONS

2111
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:44,221
AND KICKED ASS IN CHALLENGES AND

2112
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:46,849
IT'S BROUGHT ME THIS FAR AND I'M

2113
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:50,561
REALLY HAPPY WITH THE WAY I

2114
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:51,729
PLAYED.

2115
01:09:51,812 --> 01:09:52,813
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME

2116
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:54,648
TO VOTE.

2117
01:09:54,732 --> 01:10:01,197
MISSY, YOU'RE UP.

2118
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:32,478
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

2119
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:36,440
VOTES.

2120
01:10:36,523 --> 01:10:37,733
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE

2121
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:38,525
DECISION IS FINAL.

2122
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:39,777
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

2123
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:41,528
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL

2124
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:41,820
IMMEDIATELY.

2125
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:44,615
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

2126
01:10:44,698 --> 01:10:46,367
FIRST VOTE.

2127
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:50,120
KEITH.

2128
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:53,290
MISSY.

2129
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:54,375
KEITH.

2130
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:57,878
TWO VOTES KEITH, ONE VOTE MISSY.

2131
01:10:57,962 --> 01:11:03,842
ONE VOTE LEFT.

2132
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:04,927
14th PERSON VOTED OUT AND

2133
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:05,511
THE EIGHTH AND FINAL MEMBER OF

2134
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:07,262
OUR JURY.

2135
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:08,639
>> ALL RIGHT.

2136
01:11:08,722 --> 01:11:10,015
>> Jeff: KEITH, YOU NEED TO

2137
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:22,236
BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

2138
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:27,032
KEITH, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

2139
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:27,449
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

2140
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:29,034
>> SEE Y'ALL.

2141
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:30,035
>> BYE, KEITH.

2142
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:39,837
>> BYE, KEITH.

2143
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,505
>> Jeff: MISSY, JACLYN,

2144
01:11:41,588 --> 01:11:43,507
NATALIE.

2145
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:44,216
CONGRATULATIONS.

2146
01:11:44,299 --> 01:11:44,842
YOU'VE GONE AS FAR AS YOU CAN GO

2147
01:11:44,925 --> 01:11:46,844
IN THIS GAME.

2148
01:11:46,927 --> 01:11:50,139
THE POWER SHIFTS TO THE JURY.

2149
01:11:50,222 --> 01:11:52,016
EIGHT PEOPLE THAT YOU HAD A HAND

2150
01:11:52,099 --> 01:11:53,684
IN VOTING OUT, THEY WILL DECIDE

2151
01:11:53,767 --> 01:11:56,395
WHO THEY THINK IS MOST DESERVING

2152
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:58,605
OF THE TITLE OF "SOLE SURVIVOR"

2153
01:11:58,689 --> 01:11:59,648
AND THE MILLION DOLLAR CHECK

2154
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:01,108
THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT.

2155
01:12:01,191 --> 01:12:03,360
YOU HAVE ONE MORE NIGHT OUT HERE

2156
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:03,944
IN SAN JUAN DEL SUR.

2157
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:06,071
THEN WE WILL RECONVENE AGAIN

2158
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,156
TOMORROW NIGHT FOR YOUR FINAL

2159
01:12:07,239 --> 01:12:07,740
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

2160
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:08,615
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

2161
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:10,117
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

2162
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:10,492
GOOD NIGHT.

2163
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:14,371
>> MISSY, WE NEED PUBLIC

2164
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:15,205
SPEAKING 101.

2165
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:18,751
>> OKAY.

2166
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:26,508
>> SO ALL THREE OF THEM VOTED

2167
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:27,134
FOR ME.

2168
01:12:27,217 --> 01:12:27,593
IT WASN'T A BLINDSIDE.

2169
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:29,219
IT'S THREE WOMEN.

2170
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:30,596
I CAN BARELY HANDLE ONE WOMAN AT

2171
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:32,431
THE HOUSE, MUCH LESS THREE OF

2172
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:32,681
THEM HERE.

2173
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:34,224
NO HARD FEELINGS.

2174
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:36,143
I LOVE THEM ALL.

2175
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:39,480
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

2176
01:12:39,563 --> 01:12:40,856
>> Jeff: THAT RESPONSE SPEAKS

2177
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:42,775
TO HOW MUCH PEOPLE I THINK

2178
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:43,525
ENJOYED WATCHING KEITH, AND

2179
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:45,819
WATCHING HIM LEARN THE GAME AS

2180
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:47,446
HE WENT ALONG.

2181
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:49,656
AFTER IT WAS OVER-- THIS IS 15

2182
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,784
SECONDS AFTER KEITH WAS VOTED

2183
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:54,703
OUT-- I CATCH UP WITH HIM IN THE

2184
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:55,454
JUNGLE-- THIS IS AFTER A MONTH

2185
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:57,664
OF PLAYING "SURVIVOR" AND BARELY

2186
01:12:57,748 --> 01:12:59,500
MISSING OUT ON A MILLION

2187
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:00,709
DOLLARS, HERE'S WHAT WAS ON

2188
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:01,168
KEITH'S MIND.

2189
01:13:01,251 --> 01:13:02,461
YOU GO BACK HOME AND YOUR

2190
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:04,671
BUDDIES SAY, "TELL ME WHAT IT

2191
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:04,963
WAS LIKE."

2192
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:07,382
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS

2193
01:13:07,466 --> 01:13:07,674
EXPERIENCE?

2194
01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:08,258
>> WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT I

2195
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:10,928
WOULD BE SITTING IN A SPOT IN

2196
01:13:11,011 --> 01:13:11,178
NICARAGUA.

2197
01:13:11,261 --> 01:13:11,804
IF YOU WOULD HAVE ASKED ME IS

2198
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:14,223
KEITH COMING BACK FROM THE MOON

2199
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:16,642
OR SITTING IN NICARAGUA?

2200
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:17,684
THEY'D SAY I'D BE COMING BACK

2201
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:18,685
FROM THE MOON.

2202
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:19,019
( LAUGHTER ).

2203
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:19,853
>> Jeff: SO WE'RE WATCHING

2204
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:21,605
KEITH AND WE SEE HIS SON WES OUT

2205
01:13:21,688 --> 01:13:23,941
THERE, IF YOU'RE LIKE ME, AT

2206
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:25,400
SOME POINT YOU'RE THINKING WHO

2207
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:25,734
MARRIED KEITH?

2208
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:28,821
WHO CREATED THIS FAMILY?

2209
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:29,655
THIS IS DANA, WELCOME.

2210
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:30,405
>> HI.

2211
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:31,490
THANK YOU!

2212
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:33,951
>> Jeff: MOUTH HAVE YOU.

2213
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:34,451
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

2214
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:35,494
HOW LONG HAVE YOU AND KEITH BEEN

2215
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:35,702
MARRIED?

2216
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:37,287
>> WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER ABOUT 30

2217
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:37,663
YEARS MARRIED 25.

2218
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:39,414
>> Jeff: SO IS THERE

2219
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:40,207
ANYTHING-- KEITH WAS REALLY FUN

2220
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:41,416
TO WATCH BECAUSE HE DIDN'T

2221
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:42,960
REALLY KNOW THE SHOW.

2222
01:13:43,043 --> 01:13:44,002
AND HE WAS LEARNING IT.

2223
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,337
WAS THERE ANYTHING HE DID,

2224
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:46,797
THOUGH, THAT EMBARRASSED YOU OUT

2225
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:47,005
THERE?

2226
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,173
>> WELL, ABOUT THE ONLY THING

2227
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:49,049
WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WAS

2228
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:52,719
THE WAY HE WAS TRYING TO TEACH

2229
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:54,638
MISSY HOW TO RAISE HER CHILD.

2230
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:54,805
YUP.

2231
01:13:54,888 --> 01:13:55,389
>> Jeff: REALLY?

2232
01:13:55,472 --> 01:13:57,015
SO DID YOU HAVE SOME WORDS ABOUT

2233
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:57,224
THAT?

2234
01:13:57,307 --> 01:13:59,226
>> YES, WE DID, YES, WE DID.

2235
01:13:59,309 --> 01:13:59,852
YOU DON'T TELL ANOTHER WOMAN HOW

2236
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:02,229
TO RAISE HER BABY.

2237
01:14:02,312 --> 01:14:04,106
>> Jeff: MISSY DOES A GOOD JOB

2238
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:05,524
OF LETTING PEOPLE KNOW THAT

2239
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:05,732
HERSELF.

2240
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:06,650
HERE'S A QUESTION THAT CAME UP,

2241
01:14:06,733 --> 01:14:13,031
HERE'S A TWITTER QUESTION

2242
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:13,991
@SOFTBALLSAM WANTS TO KNOW, WHAT

2243
01:14:14,074 --> 01:14:14,491
ABOUT THE SPITTING?

2244
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:16,160
>> HE DID SPIT A LITTLE TOO MUCH

2245
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:18,162
ON THE ISLAND BUT THAT'S PRETTY

2246
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:18,954
TYPICAL FOR HIM.

2247
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:21,540
WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET FOR

2248
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:21,707
HIM.

2249
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:23,041
>> Jeff: THAT'S WHY WE LIKE

2250
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:23,208
HIM.

2251
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:24,835
WE ARE DOWN TO IT, JACLYN,

2252
01:14:24,918 --> 01:14:25,878
MISSY, AND NATALIE.

2253
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:26,712
THIS IS IT, FINAL TRIBAL

2254
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:28,297
COUNCIL.

2255
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:29,464
SOMEBODY'S ABOUT TO WIN A

2256
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:29,965
MILLION BUCKS.

2257
01:14:30,048 --> 01:14:32,426
NEXT TIME YOU SEE ME, I WILL

2258
01:14:32,509 --> 01:14:33,510
HAVE THE VOTES.

2259
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:35,596
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

2260
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:00,871
>> OH, MY GOSH.

2261
01:15:00,954 --> 01:15:01,747
OH, MY GOSH.

2262
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,916
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

2263
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:04,875
WHEN WE STARTED THERE WERE 10

2264
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:06,585
MEN AND EIGHT WOMEN.

2265
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:07,711
FOR THREE WOMEN TO BE SITTING IN

2266
01:15:07,794 --> 01:15:11,215
THE FINDS IS PRETTY COOL.

2267
01:15:11,298 --> 01:15:11,798
>> ON THE JURY, IT'S ALL GUYS.

2268
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:14,426
>> SEVEN MEN ON THE JURIES.

2269
01:15:14,509 --> 01:15:16,345
I'M SO NOT INTIMIDATEED BY SEVEN

2270
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:16,720
MEN.

2271
01:15:16,803 --> 01:15:18,222
I HAVE BEEN MARRIED AND DIVORCED

2272
01:15:18,305 --> 01:15:21,308
THREE TIMES, SO I'M NOT FEARFUL

2273
01:15:21,391 --> 01:15:22,142
WHATSOEVER ABOUT SPEAKING TO

2274
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:22,643
THESE GUYS.

2275
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:24,186
>> I WONDER WHAT THE QUESTIONS

2276
01:15:24,269 --> 01:15:25,187
ARE ANYTHING TO BE?

2277
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:26,688
>> I THINK TONIGHT IS GOING TO

2278
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:28,440
BE SUPER IMPORTANT FOR ME TO

2279
01:15:28,523 --> 01:15:30,108
REALLY SWAY THEM, PRESENT MYSELF

2280
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,402
THE BEST I CAN, AND NO MATTER

2281
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:33,612
HOW IT ENDS, YOU HAVE THE POWER

2282
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:34,613
TO BE POSITIVE ABOUT IT OR DIVE

2283
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:37,074
YOUR HEAD IN THE STAND AND

2284
01:15:37,157 --> 01:15:37,783
BECOME A FAILURE.

2285
01:15:37,866 --> 01:15:42,454
AND THAT IS NOT WHO I AM.

2286
01:15:42,537 --> 01:15:43,622
( SCREAMING ).

2287
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:45,207
>> OH, MY GOD!

2288
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:46,458
EGGS, BREAD, CHAMPAGNE.

2289
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:48,585
>> OH, MY GOSH!

2290
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:49,795
>> PINEAPPLE, MANGO!

2291
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:53,674
>> MY GOD, IS THAT CHEESE?

2292
01:15:53,757 --> 01:15:55,050
>> I'VE ACTUALLY LEARNED A LOT

2293
01:15:55,133 --> 01:15:55,676
ABOUT MYSELF, AND THE FACT THAT

2294
01:15:55,759 --> 01:15:57,469
I WAS ABLE TO NAVIGATE THROUGH

2295
01:15:57,552 --> 01:15:58,720
THIS WITHOUT THE ONE COMFORT

2296
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:00,305
I'VE HAD MY ENTIRE LIFE, WHICH

2297
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:00,973
WAS NAWDIO.

2298
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:04,226
AND I WAS ABLE TO DO THIS ON MY

2299
01:16:04,309 --> 01:16:05,727
OWN MAKES ME REALLY PROUD.

2300
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:07,896
AND I KNOW MY PARENTS WILL BE

2301
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,398
PROUD, TOO, BECAUSE THEY FEEL

2302
01:16:09,481 --> 01:16:09,940
LIKE WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING

2303
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:11,316
WITHOUT EACH OTHER.

2304
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,486
FINAL THREE, BABY.

2305
01:16:14,569 --> 01:16:15,779
NOW I NEED TO REALLY WORK

2306
01:16:15,862 --> 01:16:16,863
THROUGH WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY TO

2307
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:17,698
THE JURY.

2308
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:18,615
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE HAVING ANY

2309
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:23,620
REGRETS ABOUT THIS FINAL TRIBAL.

2310
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:23,829
AMAZING.

2311
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:25,289
>> OH, MY GOD!

2312
01:16:25,372 --> 01:16:26,999
>> I CAN'T LEAVE ANYTHING UP TO

2313
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:27,165
FATE.

2314
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:29,459
I GOTTA DO THE JURY'S JOB FOR

2315
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:29,668
THEM.

2316
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:31,003
I GOTTA MAKE THEM SEE WHY THEY

2317
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:31,753
NEED TO PICK ME AND WHY I

2318
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:33,839
DESERVE TO BE THE SOLE SURVIVOR.

2319
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:35,090
>> CAN'T WAIT TO RECONNECT WITH

2320
01:16:35,173 --> 01:16:36,967
JON AND BE LIKE, "I MADE IT TO

2321
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:38,760
THE FINAL BREAKFAST, SUCKER."

2322
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:44,516
( LAUGHTER )

2323
01:16:44,599 --> 01:16:46,768
I FEEL LIKE I WAS UNDERESTIMATED

2324
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:49,187
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING IN THIS

2325
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:49,354
GAME.

2326
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:50,480
WINNING THE MILLION DOLLARS

2327
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:53,191
MEANS A LOT MORE TO ME THAN IT

2328
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:53,692
WOULD ANOTHER PERSON JUST

2329
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:56,528
BECAUSE "BLOOD VERSUS WATER."

2330
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:57,279
IT'S FAMILY AND RELATIONSHIPS.

2331
01:16:57,362 --> 01:16:58,488
THAT'S WHAT I WANT MOST, I WANT

2332
01:16:58,572 --> 01:16:59,406
A FAMILY WITH JON.

2333
01:16:59,489 --> 01:17:00,907
AND I CAN'T START A FAMILY OR

2334
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:02,242
GIVE JON THE FAMILY HE WANTS

2335
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:02,868
WITHOUT THE MONEY.

2336
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:06,538
BUT THE TITLE OF "SOLE SURVIVOR"

2337
01:17:06,621 --> 01:17:08,206
WOULD MEAN MORE TO ME THAN THE

2338
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:10,250
MONEY BECAUSE THE TITLE WOULD

2339
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:11,668
EVEN FURTHER INSPIRE ALL OF THE

2340
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:14,838
GIRLS WITH M.R.K.H.

2341
01:17:14,921 --> 01:17:17,174
I WANT TO PROVE TO ALL THE GIRLS

2342
01:17:17,257 --> 01:17:18,800
THAT HAVE MY SYNDROME THAT YOU

2343
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:19,051
CAN DO IT.

2344
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:20,469
THERE ARE WAYS.

2345
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:23,805
NEVER GIVE UP.

2346
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:25,974
THIS EXPERIENCE HAS JUST MADE ME

2347
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:27,100
APPRECIATE AND REALIZE HOW

2348
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:27,851
STRONG I REALLY AM.

2349
01:17:27,934 --> 01:17:30,687
I'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR 39 DAYS.

2350
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:47,287
TONIGHT IS THE BIG

2351
01:17:47,371 --> 01:18:01,134
ONE.

2352
01:18:02,052 --> 01:18:03,303
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

2353
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:06,390
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

2354
01:18:06,473 --> 01:18:11,937
JOSH, JEREMY, WES, REED, ALEC,

2355
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:15,190
JON, BAYLOR, AND KEITH VOTED OUT

2356
01:18:15,273 --> 01:18:19,236
AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

2357
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:21,363
WELCOME TO YOUR FINAL TRIBAL

2358
01:18:21,446 --> 01:18:23,365
COUNCIL.

2359
01:18:23,448 --> 01:18:26,159
YOU'VE GONE AS FAR AS YOU CAN GO

2360
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:27,619
IN THE GAME, AND TONIGHT, IN ONE

2361
01:18:27,702 --> 01:18:31,456
OF THE TRULY UNIQUE ASPECTS OF

2362
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:32,457
"SURVIVOR," THE GAME SHIFTS.

2363
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:33,041
THE POWER MOVES FROM THIS SIDE

2364
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:36,461
OF TRIBAL OVER HERE TO THE JURY.

2365
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:37,546
EIGHT PEOPLE THAT YOU HAD A HAND

2366
01:18:37,629 --> 01:18:38,922
IN VOTING OUT WILL NOW DECIDE

2367
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:40,924
WHO WINS THIS GAME.

2368
01:18:41,007 --> 01:18:43,677
WHO GETS THE MILLION DOLLARS.

2369
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,804
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE TO

2370
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:47,889
PERSUADE THEM IT SHOULD BE YOU.

2371
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:50,016
HERE'S HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK.

2372
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:51,601
YOU WILL EACH GET A CHANCE TO

2373
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:52,144
MAKE AN OPENING STATEMENT.

2374
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:53,979
THEN THE JURY WILL GET THEIR

2375
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:54,813
CHANCE TO ADDRESS YOU.

2376
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:55,772
AND THEN WE VOTE.

2377
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:58,900
ALL RIGHT, MISSY, OPENING

2378
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:00,068
STATEMENT.

2379
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:01,194
( SIGHS ).

2380
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:03,488
>> WELL, AS I HUMBLY SIT HERE IN

2381
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,991
THE FINAL THREE, I REALIZE THAT

2382
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:08,493
THESE ROLES COULD BE REVERSED,

2383
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:09,077
AND I COULD BE SITTING THERE,

2384
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:11,538
TOO, AND I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE A

2385
01:19:11,621 --> 01:19:12,539
HUGE DECISION ON YOUR HANDS,

2386
01:19:12,622 --> 01:19:14,708
PROBABLY AS BIG AS A JURY ON A

2387
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:17,043
MURDER TRIAL BECAUSE WHAT YOU

2388
01:19:17,127 --> 01:19:18,336
DECIDE TONIGHT IS GOING TO

2389
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:21,465
AFFECT THE REST OF MY LIFE.

2390
01:19:21,548 --> 01:19:21,965
MY DEAL WAS LOYALTY FROM

2391
01:19:22,048 --> 01:19:24,551
BEGINNING TO END.

2392
01:19:24,634 --> 01:19:26,803
AND ANY TIME THAT SOMEONE SAID

2393
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:28,430
THEY DIDN'T TRUST ME, WELL, THEY

2394
01:19:28,513 --> 01:19:29,139
HAD TO GO.

2395
01:19:29,222 --> 01:19:31,683
THE BIGGEST DECISION AND THE

2396
01:19:31,766 --> 01:19:32,934
BIGGEST MOVE AND THE HARDEST

2397
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:34,436
DECISION I MADE THIS THIS GAME

2398
01:19:34,519 --> 01:19:35,645
WAS VOTING JON OUT.

2399
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:36,897
I HAD TO WAKE UP AND PLAY THE

2400
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:38,940
GAME, AND I HAD TO VOTE THAT

2401
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:40,192
WAY.

2402
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:41,860
DAY 33 WAS THE HARDEST AND THE

2403
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:44,112
ROUGHEST DAY OF THIS GAME FOR

2404
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:44,279
ME.

2405
01:19:44,362 --> 01:19:46,364
IT'S THE DAY I BROKE MY FOOT.

2406
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,492
I FINISHED THE CHALLENGE ON ONE

2407
01:19:48,575 --> 01:19:48,658
LEG.

2408
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:50,202
I BROUGHT MY TEAM TO THE

2409
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:51,912
VICTORY, BUT IT WAS DEVASTATING.

2410
01:19:51,995 --> 01:19:54,039
BUT I WASN'T GOING TO QUIT.

2411
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:55,207
THE FINISH LINE WAS IN SIGHT,

2412
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:57,083
AND I KNEW I COULD FIGHT THROUGH

2413
01:19:57,167 --> 01:19:57,250
IT.

2414
01:19:57,334 --> 01:19:57,876
AND THAT'S WHAT I DID.

2415
01:19:57,959 --> 01:20:02,130
I PLAYED THIS GAME CONSISTENTLY

2416
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:04,257
WITH INTEGRITY AND DIGNITY AND

2417
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:05,383
MAINLY LOYALTY.

2418
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:06,009
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY I DESERVE

2419
01:20:06,092 --> 01:20:10,764
TO BE THIS SEASON'S SOLE

2420
01:20:10,847 --> 01:20:11,056
SURVIVOR.

2421
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:12,474
>> Jeff: JACLYN.

2422
01:20:12,557 --> 01:20:13,558
( SIGHS ).

2423
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:16,019
>> I DESERVE TO BE THE SOLE

2424
01:20:16,102 --> 01:20:16,645
SURVIVOR BECAUSE I WENT THROUGH

2425
01:20:16,728 --> 01:20:17,854
A LOT OF UPS AND DOWNS IN THIS

2426
01:20:17,938 --> 01:20:21,107
GAME JUST LIKE IN MY REAL LIFE.

2427
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:23,401
I STARTED OUT PRETTY SLOW ON A

2428
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:25,237
TRIBE WHO HAD ME ON THE CHOPPING

2429
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,696
BLOCK FROM DAY ONE.

2430
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:28,990
I FELT REALLY ALONE.

2431
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:31,368
AND IT DIDN'T STOP ME FROM

2432
01:20:31,451 --> 01:20:31,618
FIGHTING.

2433
01:20:31,701 --> 01:20:33,328
WHEN THE TRIBE SWAP HAPPENED, I

2434
01:20:33,411 --> 01:20:35,830
WAS ABLE TO ALIGN WITH SOME

2435
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:36,957
REALLY GREAT PEOPLE, INCLUDING

2436
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,583
MY LOVED ONE.

2437
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:40,210
FROM THAT POINT ON, I WAS IN

2438
01:20:40,293 --> 01:20:41,503
THIS MIDDLE POSITION THROUGHOUT

2439
01:20:41,586 --> 01:20:47,092
THE MAJORITY OF THE ENTIRE GAME,

2440
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:47,509
SWAICHING ALLIANCES.

2441
01:20:47,592 --> 01:20:49,386
AND IF IT WASN'T FOR THAT

2442
01:20:49,469 --> 01:20:50,929
DECISION, THESE TWO WOULDN'T BE

2443
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:52,055
HERE RIGHT NEW.

2444
01:20:52,138 --> 01:20:53,807
JON GETS BLINDSIDED, AND I KNEW

2445
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:56,768
AT THAT POINT I HAD TO TAKE THE

2446
01:20:56,851 --> 01:20:57,435
REINS AND STEP IT UP AND FINISH

2447
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:59,020
THE GAME, AND THAT'S WHY I'M

2448
01:20:59,104 --> 01:21:01,106
HERE IN THE TOP THREE.

2449
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:02,482
MY JOURNEY THROUGHOUT THIS GAME

2450
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:04,025
IS LITERALLY LIKE A METAPHOR FOR

2451
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:05,402
MY LIFE.

2452
01:21:05,485 --> 01:21:07,779
WHEN I WAS 15, I WAS DIAGNOSED

2453
01:21:07,862 --> 01:21:10,532
WITH M.R.K.H. SYNDROME, WHICH

2454
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:12,951
MEANS I WAS BORN WITHOUT HALF MY

2455
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:14,703
REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS.

2456
01:21:14,786 --> 01:21:16,413
WAS DOWN AND ALONE, FEELING

2457
01:21:16,496 --> 01:21:17,956
REALLY TERRIBLE ABOUT WHO I WAS,

2458
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:19,708
AND THEN I JUST GAINED THIS

2459
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:20,667
STRENGTH THROUGHOUT MY LIFE,

2460
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:22,419
TURNED A NEGATIVE INTO A

2461
01:21:22,502 --> 01:21:24,421
POSITIVE, AND JUST TRIUMPHED

2462
01:21:24,504 --> 01:21:24,629
FROM IT.

2463
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:26,339
AND I FEEL LIKE I DID THAT IN

2464
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:27,757
THIS GAME, TOO.

2465
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:28,383
AND THAT'S WHY I WANT TO BE THE

2466
01:21:28,466 --> 01:21:28,925
SOLE SURVIVOR.

2467
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:30,427
>> Jeff: NATALIE.

2468
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:32,721
>> I FEEL LIKE I DESERVE YOUR

2469
01:21:32,804 --> 01:21:34,431
VOTES TONIGHT AND FEEL LIKE I

2470
01:21:34,514 --> 01:21:36,516
DESERVE THE TITLE OF SOLE

2471
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:36,808
SURVIVOR.

2472
01:21:36,891 --> 01:21:37,976
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE OUTWIT,

2473
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:40,103
OUTPLAYED, AND OUTLASTED BETTER

2474
01:21:40,186 --> 01:21:41,688
THAN THE TWO LADIES SITTING NEXT

2475
01:21:41,771 --> 01:21:42,188
TO ME.

2476
01:21:42,272 --> 01:21:46,902
I HAVE OUTWIT BY MAKING SMART,

2477
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:49,321
RISKY, AND EVEN SCARY MOVES BY

2478
01:21:49,404 --> 01:21:49,863
MYSELF.

2479
01:21:49,946 --> 01:21:51,740
OUTPLAY EYE FEEL LIKE I

2480
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:53,575
REPRESENT WELL IN EVERY

2481
01:21:53,658 --> 01:21:54,576
CHALLENGE OF THE GAME.

2482
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:56,077
ONLY GIRL TO VOLUNTEER TO GO TO

2483
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:57,829
EXILE TWICE, CARRIED MY WEIGHT

2484
01:21:57,912 --> 01:21:58,538
AROUND CAMP.

2485
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:00,790
NEVER ONCE HAS ANYBODY CALLED ME

2486
01:22:00,874 --> 01:22:00,999
LAZY.

2487
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:02,125
AND OUTLAST, I FEEL LIKE, YOU

2488
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:04,544

DAY THREE, WHEN SHE GOT KICKED

2490
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:07,547
OUT, I CHANGED THE WAY I PLAYED

2491
01:22:07,631 --> 01:22:10,216
THE GAME FROM LET'S JUST SURVIVE

2492
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:11,593

01:22:11,676 --> 01:22:11,801

YOU GOTTA WIN THIS GAME.

2495
01:22:12,886 --> 01:22:13,428
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE HERE, YOU

2496
01:22:13,511 --> 01:22:15,680
MIGHT AS WELL WIN IT AND DO

2497
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:18,016
EVERYTHING WITH A PURPOSE.

2498
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:20,393
SITTING HERE ON DAY 39, MAKES ME

2499
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:22,938
SO PROUD, AND FEEL SO HONORED TO

2500
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:25,649
BE PLEADING MY CASE TO YOU GUYS

2501
01:22:25,732 --> 01:22:28,401
TONIGHT, ESPECIALLY SINCE I FEEL

01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:32,155
HONESTLY, THAT LAST NIGHT, THE

2503
01:22:32,238 --> 01:22:33,114
RIGHT DECISION AND THE RIGHT

2504
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:34,115
PERSON TO GO HOME SHOULD HAVE

2505
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:36,076
BEEN ME, NOT KEITH, IF THEY MADE

2506
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:38,036
THE RIGHT DECISION.

2507
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:40,163
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, JURY, I

2508
01:22:40,246 --> 01:22:41,206
KNOW SOME OF YOU HAVE WAITED A

2509
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:44,084
LONG TIME TO ADDRESS THESE

2510
01:22:44,167 --> 01:22:44,292
THREE.

2511
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:45,627
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A MOMENT

2512
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:46,836
TO COLLECT YOUR THOUGHTS.

2513
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:51,174
AND THEN WE'LL GET TO IT.

2514
01:22:51,257 --> 01:23:03,061
THIS IS YOUR FIRST CHANCE TO

2515
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:04,229
ADDRESS

2516
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:06,606
MISSY, JACLYN, AND NATALIE.

2517
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:07,774
YOU ARE LOOKING FOR INFORMATION

2518
01:23:07,857 --> 01:23:09,109
TO HELP YOU MAKE A

2519
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:12,237
MILLION-DOLLAR DECISION.

2520
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:18,076
JON, GET US STARTED.

2521
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:20,036
>> JACLYN.

2522
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:23,039
I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE

2523
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:24,249
OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT A BIG

2524
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:27,377
MOVE OR DECISION THAT YOU SOLELY

2525
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:29,879
WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING AND

2526
01:23:29,963 --> 01:23:32,090
HOW DID IT AFFECT THE FINAL

2527
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:32,298
THREE?

2528
01:23:32,382 --> 01:23:34,759
>> I THINK FOR ME, IT WOULD BE

2529
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:35,218
THE FIRST VOTE, JOSH.

2530
01:23:35,301 --> 01:23:38,221
I THINK THAT THAT SWUNG THE

2531
01:23:38,304 --> 01:23:40,140
ENTIRE GAME, AND I KNEW THAT IF

2532
01:23:40,223 --> 01:23:41,850
I WAS WITH THE GUYS LIKE KEITH

2533
01:23:41,933 --> 01:23:43,184
AND WES AND JOSH, I'D BE ON THE

2534
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:46,730
BOTTOM, JUST LIKE I WAS AT

2535
01:23:46,813 --> 01:23:47,731
COYOPA WITH THEM.

2536
01:23:47,814 --> 01:23:51,609
REED CAME TO ME AND ASKED ME AM

2537
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:51,818
I OKAY?

2538
01:23:51,901 --> 01:23:53,111
AND I SAID YES.

2539
01:23:53,194 --> 01:23:54,112
HE THANKED ME LATER FOR BEING

2540
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:56,656
HONEST BUT I WASN'T BECAUSE HIS

2541
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:58,408
LOVED ONE WENT HOME, AND I KEPT

2542
01:23:58,491 --> 01:23:58,742
THAT FROM HIM.

2543
01:23:58,825 --> 01:24:00,243
BUT I GOT TO THE FINAL THREE,

2544
01:24:00,326 --> 01:24:02,078
AND I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE

2545
01:24:02,162 --> 01:24:03,371
IF I SWUNG THE OTHER WAY AND

2546
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:06,583
WENT WITH THE JOSH AND REED

2547
01:24:06,666 --> 01:24:06,833
ALLIANCE.

2548
01:24:06,916 --> 01:24:08,460
>> SURE, SURE.

2549
01:24:08,543 --> 01:24:11,588
GOOD LUCK.

2550
01:24:11,671 --> 01:24:13,214
>> THANKS, JON.

2551
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:16,843
KEITH, YOU'RE UP.

2552
01:24:16,926 --> 01:24:21,222
>> HI, GALS.

2553
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:23,141
NAT, HOW DOES IT FEEL THE LAST

2554
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:25,518
WORDS YOU EVER SPOKE TO ME WAS A

2555
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:25,685
LIE?

2556
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:26,269
HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?

2557
01:24:26,352 --> 01:24:28,772
>> I KNEW, KEITH, IF IT WASN'T

2558
01:24:28,855 --> 01:24:29,314
YOU, IT WAS GOING TO BE ME.

2559
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:30,190
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE'RE

2560
01:24:30,273 --> 01:24:32,525
ALL TRYING TO GET TO THE FINAL

2561
01:24:32,609 --> 01:24:32,734
THREE.

2562
01:24:32,817 --> 01:24:33,359
I REALLY DID FEEL BAD ABOUT, YOU

2563
01:24:33,443 --> 01:24:35,653
KNOW, TELLING YOU ABOUT MISSY,

2564
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:36,279
BUT I THINK THEY WERE ALL TRYING

2565
01:24:36,362 --> 01:24:38,198
TO MAKE IT TO HERE.

2566
01:24:38,281 --> 01:24:40,116
AND I KNEW THAT THE ONLY WAY I

2567
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,743
COULD SURVIVE IS IF I SOLD YOU

2568
01:24:41,826 --> 01:24:42,994
AS THE BIGGEST THREAT, AND YOU

2569
01:24:43,077 --> 01:24:43,411
ARE A BIG THREAT.

2570
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:45,747
BETWEEN YOU AND MISSY, I NEEDED

2571
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:47,290
YOU TWO IN THE FINAL FOUR SO THE

2572
01:24:47,373 --> 01:24:47,791
TARGET WOULD BE OFF ME.

2573
01:24:47,874 --> 01:24:49,417
>> WELL, I KNOW YOU GOTTA DO

2574
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:50,293
WHAT YOU GOTTA DO, AND I JUST

2575
01:24:50,376 --> 01:24:53,421
HATE-- I HATED THE CONSTANT

2576
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:53,630
LYING.

2577
01:24:53,713 --> 01:24:54,380
I KNOW IT'S PART OF THE GAME,

2578
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:55,173
BUT I WENT THROUGH HALF THIS

2579
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:58,009
GAME WITHOUT AN ALLIANCE,

2580
01:24:58,092 --> 01:25:00,303
WITHOUT LYING, WITHOUT-- UNTIL

2581
01:25:00,386 --> 01:25:02,472
IT BOILS DOWN TO IT.

2582
01:25:02,555 --> 01:25:04,599
IT'S JUST-- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO

2583
01:25:04,682 --> 01:25:05,016
SAY.

2584
01:25:05,099 --> 01:25:06,601
THAT'S THE WAY I LOOK AT IT.

2585
01:25:06,684 --> 01:25:07,602
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU,

2586
01:25:07,685 --> 01:25:08,061
KEITH.

2587
01:25:08,144 --> 01:25:10,313
>> THANK YOU.

2588
01:25:10,396 --> 01:25:13,483
>> Jeff: ALEC, YOU'RE UP.

2589
01:25:13,566 --> 01:25:17,946
>> ALL RIGHT, LADIES, WELL, NAT,

2590
01:25:18,029 --> 01:25:19,823
WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST ONE MOVE IN

2591
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:20,406
THIS GAME?

2592
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:21,241
AND HOW DID IT IMPACT THE

2593
01:25:21,324 --> 01:25:22,742
TURNOUT OF IT?

2594
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:24,661
>> THE ONE MOVE I MADE THAT

2595
01:25:24,744 --> 01:25:25,745
ENDED UP CHANGING THE COURSE OF

2596
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:28,748
THE GAME FOR ME AFTER WAS VOTING

2597
01:25:28,832 --> 01:25:29,541
YOU YOU OFF.

2598
01:25:29,624 --> 01:25:31,251
>> I KNEW YOU WOULD SAY THAT.

2599
01:25:31,334 --> 01:25:32,460
>> THAT WAS A MOVE NOBODY KNEW I

2600
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,878
WAS GOING TO MAKE BECAUSE I HAD

2601
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:35,171
THIS FEELING,UN, I COULD WORK

2602
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:36,589
WITH KEITH, NO MATTER WHAT

2603
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:36,881
HAPPENED.

2604
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:38,675
I COULDN'T DO THAT WITH YOU.

2605
01:25:38,758 --> 01:25:40,385
GETTING YOU OUT, MEANT KEITH WAS

2606
01:25:40,468 --> 01:25:41,302
ABLE TO HELP ME AND BAYLOR AND

2607
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:43,930
MISSY GET JON OUT, AND AFTER JON

2608
01:25:44,013 --> 01:25:44,556
WENT, GETTING OUT BAYLOR MEANT

2609
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:46,933
ALL THE COUPLES IN MY BIG,

2610
01:25:47,016 --> 01:25:48,935
STRONG ALLIANCE WAS GONE, AND WE

2611
01:25:49,018 --> 01:25:50,728
WERE A BUNCH OF SINGLES.

2612
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:51,980
SOAS IT WAS PROBABLY YOU.

2613
01:25:52,063 --> 01:25:54,899
>> ALL RIGHT, MOMMA.

2614
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:57,068
YOU CLAIM TO BE THE MOTHER IN

2615
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:57,527
THIS GAME.

2616
01:25:57,610 --> 01:26:04,951
WHAT WAS SO MOTHERLY ABOUT THE

2617
01:26:05,034 --> 01:26:06,578
WAY YOU PLAYED THE GAME JAI

2618
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:07,370
CENTERED MYSELF IN THE MOM

2619
01:26:07,453 --> 01:26:07,954
POSITION IN THE MIDDLE OF WHAT

2620
01:26:08,037 --> 01:26:10,582
WE CALLED OUR DYSFUNCTIONAL

2621
01:26:10,665 --> 01:26:12,417
FAMILY AND I AS THE MOM GOT TO

2622
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,252
DIRECT PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR THE

2623
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:15,461
PEOPLE I WANTED OUT WHICH WERE

2624
01:26:15,545 --> 01:26:17,046
THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD SAY THEY

2625
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:18,339
DIDN'T TRUST ME, STARTING WITH

2626
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:19,716
YOUR BROTHER, DREW.

2627
01:26:19,799 --> 01:26:20,592
THAT'S WHAT I DID.

2628
01:26:20,675 --> 01:26:21,426
I STAYED IN THE CONTROL POSITION

2629
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:23,219
AND DIRECTED MY PEOPLE TO DO

2630
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:25,889
WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO.

2631
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:27,724
>> OKAY.

2632
01:26:27,807 --> 01:26:30,476
>> Jeff: THANKS, ALEC.

2633
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:31,895
BAYLOR, YOU'RE UP.

2634
01:26:31,978 --> 01:26:32,645
>> OH!

2635
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:34,981
OH, MY GOSH!

2636
01:26:35,064 --> 01:26:37,275
SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS.

2637
01:26:37,358 --> 01:26:38,860
OBVIOUSLY, I LIKE BEING A GIRL

2638
01:26:38,943 --> 01:26:40,320
AND LIKE SEEING THREE LADIES UP

2639
01:26:40,403 --> 01:26:41,237
THERE, REPRESENT.

2640
01:26:41,321 --> 01:26:43,531
OKAY, I JUST WANT TO TALK TO MY

2641
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:45,658
MOM FOR A SEC.

2642
01:26:45,742 --> 01:26:49,621
SO, MOM, I'M GOING TO TRY NOT TO

2643
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:49,787
CRY.

2644
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:52,749
SO, OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS MUCH MORE

2645
01:26:52,832 --> 01:26:56,252
THAN A GAM FOR YOU AND ME JUST

2646
01:26:56,336 --> 01:26:58,546
BECAUSE RELATING IT TO OUR LIFE

2647
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:00,298
BACK HOME, WE'VE BEEN THROUGH

2648
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:01,466
THE RINGER TOGETHER.

2649
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:04,052
AND WE WENT THROUGH THE RINGER

2650
01:27:04,135 --> 01:27:05,929
TOGETHER HERE AS WELL.

2651
01:27:06,012 --> 01:27:10,308
I FEEL LIKE WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN ON

2652
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:12,977
ONE FOOT, HOBBLING THROUGH

2653
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:14,771
MARRIAGES AND DIVORCES AND MEN

2654
01:27:14,854 --> 01:27:16,940
COMING INTO OUR LIFE AND OUT.

2655
01:27:17,023 --> 01:27:19,108
YOU KNOW, BEING BLINDSIDED, AND

2656
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:21,903
I FEEL LIKE YOU MAKING IT TO THE

2657
01:27:21,986 --> 01:27:26,658
FINAL THREE ON ONE FOOT IS THE

2658
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:29,577
MOST INCREDIBLE THING YOU'VE

2659
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:33,373
EVER DONE IN OUR LIFE.

2660
01:27:33,456 --> 01:27:36,167
SO I'M SUPER PROUD OF YOU, JUST

2661
01:27:36,250 --> 01:27:36,876
SO YOU KNOW.

2662
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:37,377
I LOVE YOU.

2663
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:41,464
CONGRATS, YOU GUYS.

2664
01:27:41,547 --> 01:27:44,425
>> I LOVE YOU BACK.

2665
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:47,178
THAT'S THE BEST HUG I'VE EVER

2666
01:27:47,261 --> 01:27:50,807
HAD, RIGHT THERE.

2667
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:51,474
I'LL TAKE IT.

2668
01:27:51,557 --> 01:27:56,020
>> Jeff: JOSH, YOU'RE UP.

2669
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:57,605
>> HEY, GUYS, WELL DONE.

2670
01:27:57,689 --> 01:27:59,482
I CAN'T SAY THEY DON'T WISH I

2671
01:27:59,565 --> 01:28:01,359
WAS RIGHT IN THOSE POSITIONS

2672
01:28:01,442 --> 01:28:02,735
TONIGHT, BUT YOU GUYS ARE THERE

2673
01:28:02,819 --> 01:28:06,072
AND NOT ME, SO GOOD JOB ON YOU.

2674
01:28:06,155 --> 01:28:07,240
JACLYN, I GUESS I WANT TO KNOW

2675
01:28:07,323 --> 01:28:09,742
DO YOU THINK THAT THE REASON WHY

2676
01:28:09,826 --> 01:28:10,535
YOU'RE HERE TONIGHT IS FROM,

2677
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:13,079
LIKE, THE STRENGTH OF YOUR OWN

2678
01:28:13,162 --> 01:28:14,455
MERIT OR DO YOU THINK CHOICES

2679
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:16,958
MADE BY STRONGER PLAYERS IN THIS

2680
01:28:17,041 --> 01:28:18,584
GAME IS THE REASON WHY YOU'RE

2681
01:28:18,668 --> 01:28:19,293
SITTING HERE?

2682
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:20,253
>> NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

2683
01:28:20,336 --> 01:28:21,546
I MEAN, EVERY DECISION BETWEEN

2684
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:24,674
ME AND JON WAS ARGUED AND

2685
01:28:24,757 --> 01:28:26,259
THOUGHT OUT AND DISCUSSED.

2686
01:28:26,342 --> 01:28:27,927
THAT'S WHY JON AND I WENT OFF

2687
01:28:28,011 --> 01:28:29,554
ALONE TOGETHER MULTIPLE TIMES

2688
01:28:29,637 --> 01:28:32,640
AND WEIGHED OUT PROS AND CONS OF

2689
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:32,932
EVERYTHING.

2690
01:28:33,016 --> 01:28:35,268
IF YOU'RE SAYING STRONGER

2691
01:28:35,351 --> 01:28:38,021
PLAYER, MEANING JON, NO.

2692
01:28:38,104 --> 01:28:40,314
MY MERIT CARRIED A LOT OF THOSE

2693
01:28:40,398 --> 01:28:40,565
DECISIONS.

2694
01:28:40,648 --> 01:28:42,275
>> CAN YOU JUST GIVE US, LIKE,

2695
01:28:42,358 --> 01:28:43,651
ONE MOVE THAT WAS SOLELY YOUR

2696
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:45,903
MOVE, AND NOT INVOLVING ANYONE

2697
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:48,531
ELSE, THAT IT WAS YOUR IDEA.

2698
01:28:48,614 --> 01:28:50,533
>> VOTING YOU OUT WAS MY MOVE

2699
01:28:50,616 --> 01:28:51,326
AND MY IDEA.

2700
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:53,036
>> OKAY.

2701
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:53,244
COOL.

2702
01:28:53,327 --> 01:28:56,372
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

2703
01:28:56,456 --> 01:29:03,254
>> Jeff: WES, YOU'RE UP.

2704
01:29:03,337 --> 01:29:05,131
>> ALL RIGHT.

2705
01:29:05,214 --> 01:29:05,423
CONGRATS.

2706
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:06,049
>> THANKS.

2707
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:07,925
>> ME PLAYING WITH MY DAD WAS

2708
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:09,886
AWESOME, AND I'VE BEEN WATCHING

2709
01:29:09,969 --> 01:29:11,554
SINCE I WAS NINE, FINALLY

2710
01:29:11,637 --> 01:29:12,472
GETTING TO PLAY WITH HIM WAS

2711
01:29:12,555 --> 01:29:13,890
LIKE, OH, CRAP.

2712
01:29:13,973 --> 01:29:15,391
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST A GREAT

2713
01:29:15,475 --> 01:29:17,143
EXPERIENCE, AND MY QUESTION TO

2714
01:29:17,226 --> 01:29:17,685
Y'ALL IS WHAT WAS IT LIKE

2715
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:21,230
GETTING TO PLAY WITH YOUR LOVED

2716
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:21,564
ONE?

2717
01:29:21,647 --> 01:29:23,816
Y'ALL CAN DECIDE WHO GOES FIRST.

2718
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:26,152
>> FOR ME IT WAS LIKE A DREAM

2719
01:29:26,235 --> 01:29:26,652
COME TRUE.

2720
01:29:26,736 --> 01:29:28,738
BAYLOR AND I HAVE TAKEN MANY

2721
01:29:28,821 --> 01:29:30,573
CRAZY PATHS, AND THIS ONE, BY

2722
01:29:30,656 --> 01:29:31,532
FAR, WAS THE BEST.

2723
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:33,451
BUT I ADORE YOUR DAD.

2724
01:29:33,534 --> 01:29:35,036
WE PLAYED FROM THE VERY START OF

2725
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:36,913
THIS GAME TOGETHER, AND HE WAS

2726
01:29:36,996 --> 01:29:38,081
THE SHOULDER WHO LITERALLY

2727
01:29:38,164 --> 01:29:39,874
CARRIED ME WHEN I BROKE MY FOOD

2728
01:29:39,957 --> 01:29:40,083
FOOT.

2729
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:41,292
SO I LOVED THAT, TOO.

2730
01:29:41,375 --> 01:29:41,834
>> THAT'S GOOD.

2731
01:29:41,918 --> 01:29:43,586
I LIKE THAT.

2732
01:29:43,669 --> 01:29:45,546
>> PLAYING WITH JON WAS A LITTLE

2733
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:45,797
DIFFERENT.

2734
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:48,800
I MEAN, BOYFRIEND-GIRLFRIEND

2735
01:29:48,883 --> 01:29:52,303
SCENARIO IS DIFFERENT THAN

2736
01:29:52,386 --> 01:29:53,513
MOTHER-DAUGHTER, FATHER-SON,

2737
01:29:53,596 --> 01:29:53,805
OBVIOUSLY.

2738
01:29:53,888 --> 01:29:55,389
BUT IT'S BEEN A GREAT

2739
01:29:55,473 --> 01:29:55,681
EXPERIENCE.

2740
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:56,599
I FEEL LIKE IT'S BEEN A

2741
01:29:56,682 --> 01:29:57,934
COMMUNICATION THING FOR US,

2742
01:29:58,017 --> 01:29:58,893
THAT'S FOR SURE.

2743
01:29:58,976 --> 01:29:59,143
>> NAT?

2744
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:01,562
>> YOU KNOW, THE LONGEST I'VE

2745
01:30:01,646 --> 01:30:02,814
BEEN APART FROM NADIYA WAS

2746
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:03,856
PROBABLY A WEEK AND A HALF, AND

2747
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:05,316
IT'S BEEN 36 DAYS I HAVEN'T

2748
01:30:05,399 --> 01:30:07,568
HEARD FROM HER, TALKED TO HER--

2749
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:08,569
OH, MY GOSH.

2750
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:10,530
I'M GOING TO CRY-- OR SEEN HER.

2751
01:30:10,613 --> 01:30:12,198
AND I FEEL LIKE EVEN THOUGH I

2752
01:30:12,281 --> 01:30:13,908
DIDN'T GET TO PLAY WITH NAWDIO,

2753
01:30:13,991 --> 01:30:15,743
THE FACT THAT DITHIS ALONE MAKES

2754
01:30:15,827 --> 01:30:17,495
ME PROUD BECAUSE I'VE NEVER DONE

2755
01:30:17,578 --> 01:30:18,287
ANYTHING WITHOUT HER.

2756
01:30:18,371 --> 01:30:22,625
I'VE DONE THIS WHOLE THING NOT

2757
01:30:22,708 --> 01:30:24,585
THINKING ABOUT MAKING NAWD YEAH

2758
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:27,588
PROUD AND IF SHE GOT KICKED OUT

2759
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:30,258
FIRST, MY TORCH WAS GOING TO BE

2760
01:30:30,341 --> 01:30:31,634
THE LAST TO PUT OUT.

2761
01:30:31,717 --> 01:30:32,969
>> Jeff: DID YOU GET WHAT YOU

2762
01:30:33,052 --> 01:30:33,177
NEEDED?

2763
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:35,429
>> I GOT WHAT I NEEDED.

2764
01:30:35,513 --> 01:30:36,556
>> Jeff: JEREMY, YOU'RE UP.

2765
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:37,306
>> WHAT'S UP?

2766
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:37,849
I'M A STUDENT OF THIS GAME.

2767
01:30:37,932 --> 01:30:40,268
AND WHEN YOU ALL MAKE BIG MOVES,

2768
01:30:40,351 --> 01:30:41,477
I LIKE THAT.

2769
01:30:41,561 --> 01:30:42,937
YOU MADE A BIG MOVE ON ME.

2770
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:43,688
I APPLAUD THAT.

2771
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:45,064
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

2772
01:30:45,148 --> 01:30:46,149
GOOD JOB.

2773
01:30:46,232 --> 01:30:48,067
I THINK IT COULD HAVE GONE BAD,

2774
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:52,029
BUT THE BEST PLAYER IS GOING TO

2775
01:30:52,113 --> 01:30:52,196
WIN.

2776
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:53,948
NO MATTER-- EVERYBODY HERE, THE

2777
01:30:54,031 --> 01:30:55,324
BEST PLAYER IS GOING TO WIN.

2778
01:30:55,408 --> 01:30:56,659
AND I THOUGHT I WAS UP THERE,

2779
01:30:56,742 --> 01:30:58,536
BUT Y'ALL GOT ME.

2780
01:30:58,619 --> 01:31:02,540
BUT, CLEARLY, NAT BALLED OUT.

2781
01:31:02,623 --> 01:31:03,958
LIKE YOU GOTTA JUST GIVE IT TO

2782
01:31:04,041 --> 01:31:04,125
HER.

2783
01:31:04,208 --> 01:31:05,960
SHE BALLED OUT, SHOW GIVE HER,

2784
01:31:06,043 --> 01:31:06,627
HER CREDIT.

2785
01:31:06,711 --> 01:31:08,337
DON'T BE MAD.

2786
01:31:08,421 --> 01:31:09,547
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

2787
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:12,133
WE ALL WISH WE WERE THERE, BUT

2788
01:31:12,216 --> 01:31:12,633
WE AIN'T.

2789
01:31:12,717 --> 01:31:14,552
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

2790
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:14,886
DON'T BE BAD.

2791
01:31:14,969 --> 01:31:16,721
I LOVE YOU ALL.

2792
01:31:16,804 --> 01:31:19,056
I HAVE NOTHING BAD TO SAY ANY

2793
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:19,265
ANYBODY.

2794
01:31:19,348 --> 01:31:20,600
I DON'T EVEN NEED A

2795
01:31:20,683 --> 01:31:20,975
BACK-AND-FORTH.

2796
01:31:21,058 --> 01:31:22,268
I FEEL GOOD.

2797
01:31:22,351 --> 01:31:22,727
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU ALL.

2798
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:24,896
>> THANK YOU.

2799
01:31:24,979 --> 01:31:25,396
>> THANKS.

2800
01:31:25,479 --> 01:31:25,688
>> LOVE YOU.

2801
01:31:25,771 --> 01:31:29,609
>> Jeff: THANKS, JEREMY.

2802
01:31:29,692 --> 01:31:31,402
ALL RIGHT, REED, YOU'RE UP.

2803
01:31:31,485 --> 01:31:33,988
>> LADIES, JUST A FEW THINGS

2804
01:31:34,071 --> 01:31:37,783
BEFORE WE CLOSE TONIGHT.

2805
01:31:37,867 --> 01:31:39,493
NAT, I JUST HAVE TO SAY THEY

2806
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:40,870
LOVED WATCHING YOUR GAME PLAY.

2807
01:31:40,953 --> 01:31:43,080
IT WAS DYNAMIC AT TIMES A LITTLE

2808
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:43,456
SPASTIC.

2809
01:31:43,539 --> 01:31:45,208
I THOUGHT YOU MADE SOME REALLY

2810
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:46,209
GREAT CHOICE.

2811
01:31:46,292 --> 01:31:47,919
SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY

2812
01:31:48,002 --> 01:31:48,878
CONGRATS, IT'S AWESOME.

2813
01:31:48,961 --> 01:31:49,503
>> OH, THANKS.

2814
01:31:49,587 --> 01:31:50,755
>> JACLYN, YOU'RE ANOTHER PERSON

2815
01:31:50,838 --> 01:31:52,173
I REALLY ENJOYED GETTING TO KNOW

2816
01:31:52,256 --> 01:31:54,175
OUT HERE, AND IT WAS SO FUNNY

2817
01:31:54,258 --> 01:31:55,551
BECAUSE I NEVER REALLY FELT LIKE

2818
01:31:55,635 --> 01:31:57,261
WE COULD GET OUR PLAN TO

2819
01:31:57,345 --> 01:31:59,305
CONVERGE TOGETHER, BUT THAT

2820
01:31:59,388 --> 01:32:01,307
DIDN'T STOP ME FROM TRYING WITH

2821
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:02,600
YOU AND STILL HAVING A GOOD TIME

2822
01:32:02,683 --> 01:32:03,643
TRYING TO PLAY THE GAME.

2823
01:32:03,726 --> 01:32:05,353
IT WAS NICE TO GET TO PLAY WITH

2824
01:32:05,436 --> 01:32:05,519
YOU.

2825
01:32:05,603 --> 01:32:06,687
AND I DO LOOKED FOR TO, YOU

2826
01:32:06,771 --> 01:32:08,564
KNOW, HANGING OUT WITH YOU

2827
01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:12,360
AFTERWARDS.

2828
01:32:12,443 --> 01:32:15,154
MISSY, YOU CAST YOURSELF AS THE

2829
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:16,280
MOTHERLY FIGURE.

2830
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:17,573
HOWEVER, FANS OF CLASSIC

2831
01:32:17,657 --> 01:32:18,616
LITERARY FICTION WILL SEE

2832
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:21,536
THROUGH VERY QUICKLY TO WHO YOUR

2833
01:32:21,619 --> 01:32:22,495
TRUE CHARACTER WAS, WHICH WAS

2834
01:32:22,578 --> 01:32:24,789
THE WICKED STEP-MOTHER, REALLY,

2835
01:32:24,872 --> 01:32:26,123
OF THE TRIBE.

2836
01:32:26,207 --> 01:32:26,749
IT'S THE ECCENTRIC WOMAN WHO

2837
01:32:26,832 --> 01:32:29,919
COMES IN AND MAKES DEMANDS OF

2838
01:32:30,002 --> 01:32:32,088
EVERYONE TO THE THINGS FOR WHICH

2839
01:32:32,171 --> 01:32:34,048
SHE FEELS SO ENTITLED.

2840
01:32:34,131 --> 01:32:36,092
SHE SPOILS HER CHILDRENS BY BYE

2841
01:32:36,175 --> 01:32:37,343
PERHAPS GIVING THEM MORE RICE AT

2842
01:32:37,426 --> 01:32:37,927
DINNER OR THE BEST PLACES TO

2843
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:41,514
SLEEP AT NIGHT IN THE SHELTER.

2844
01:32:41,597 --> 01:32:43,140
SHE TAKES THINGS THAT SHE'S

2845
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:45,351
EITHER NOT ENTITLED TO OR DIDN'T

2846
01:32:45,434 --> 01:32:47,311
EARN HERSELF WHICH WAS ALWAYS

2847
01:32:47,395 --> 01:32:47,895
EVIDENCED BY THE FACT YOU GOT

2848
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:50,564
MORE GIMMES IN THIS GAME THAN

2849
01:32:50,648 --> 01:32:51,399
ANYONE AND PERFORMED THE WORST

2850
01:32:51,482 --> 01:32:53,276
OUT OF ANYONE AT CHALLENGES.

2851
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:54,777
LASTLY, YOU MADE THE

2852
01:32:54,860 --> 01:32:56,821
QUINTESSENTIAL WICKED

2853
01:32:56,904 --> 01:32:58,406
STEP-MOTHER MOVE BY ABUSING THE

2854
01:32:58,489 --> 01:32:59,699
HELP, WHICH IN THIS CASE, WAS

2855
01:32:59,782 --> 01:33:00,992
THE MINORITY ALLIANCES

2856
01:33:01,075 --> 01:33:01,784
THROUGHOUT THE GAME.

2857
01:33:01,867 --> 01:33:05,538
YOU ALWAYS MADE SURE THEY FELT

2858
01:33:05,621 --> 01:33:05,830
INFERIOR.

2859
01:33:05,913 --> 01:33:07,081
YOU ALWAYS KEPT THEM IN THEIR

2860
01:33:07,164 --> 01:33:07,290
PLACE.

2861
01:33:07,373 --> 01:33:10,668
AND YOU ALWAYS MADE IT EMINENTLY

2862
01:33:10,751 --> 01:33:11,252
CLEAR, THEY WEREN'T COMING TO

2863
01:33:11,335 --> 01:33:14,380
THE BALL, WHICH IS THE TRIBAL

2864
01:33:14,463 --> 01:33:15,965
COUNCIL THIS EVENING HERE, WITH

2865
01:33:16,048 --> 01:33:16,132
YOU.

2866
01:33:16,215 --> 01:33:17,842
THAT ALWAYS FELT LIKE YOUR FATAL

2867
01:33:17,925 --> 01:33:20,553
FLAW IN YOUR WHOLE PLAN.

2868
01:33:20,636 --> 01:33:21,721
UNLIKE LIFE, IN THE GAME OF

2869
01:33:21,804 --> 01:33:22,763
"SURVIVOR," THE OUTCASTS ARE THE

2870
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:25,182
ONES WHO GET THE FINAL SAY.

2871
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:27,184
SO IN A SWEEPING MOMENT OF

2872
01:33:27,268 --> 01:33:28,269
POETIC JUSTICE, THE PEOPLE TO

2873
01:33:28,352 --> 01:33:31,105
WHICH YOU WERE SO RUDE AND

2874
01:33:31,188 --> 01:33:31,814
TERRIBLE TO BEFORE RELEGATING

2875
01:33:31,897 --> 01:33:32,732
THEM TO THE JURY WITH THE HELP

2876
01:33:32,815 --> 01:33:35,526
OF YOUR ALLIANCE ARE GOING TO

2877
01:33:35,609 --> 01:33:38,446
DECIDE YOUR FATE THIS EVENING.

2878
01:33:38,529 --> 01:33:40,698
THIS IS WHY I LOVE FAIRY TALES

2879
01:33:40,781 --> 01:33:43,367
BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS HAVE A HAPPY

2880
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:43,576
ENDING.

2881
01:33:43,659 --> 01:33:46,412
AND THE WICKED STEP-MOTHER,

2882
01:33:46,495 --> 01:33:48,539
NEVER WINS.

2883
01:33:48,622 --> 01:33:52,793
NAT, JACLYN, GOOD LUCK.

2884
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:54,712

2885
01:33:54,795 --> 01:33:57,590
FINAL TRIBAL FOR SURE.

2886

THIS IS WHAT COMES WITH MAKING

2887
01:33:58,799 --> 01:34:01,218
IT TO THE FINAL THREE.

2888
01:34:01,302 --> 01:34:01,844
A JURY WHO IS GOING TO MAKE YOU

2889
01:34:01,927 --> 01:34:04,263
EARN IT EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

2890
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:07,016
>> BAIL ODON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

2891
01:34:07,099 --> 01:34:08,100
>> STOP!

2892
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:08,809
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER.

2893
01:34:08,893 --> 01:34:12,480
>> I KNOW!

2894
01:34:12,563 --> 01:34:13,773
>> JUST LET ME BREATHE FOR A

2895
01:34:13,856 --> 01:34:14,023
SECOND.

2896
01:34:14,106 --> 01:34:14,190
