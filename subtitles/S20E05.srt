00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,252
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:03,253
<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:05,547
Heroes, for the second time in a

4
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:06,881
row, you guys will lose somebody

5
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:07,882
at Tribal Council.

6
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,676
By day six, the Heroes had lost

7
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:11,302
two challenges and were beaten

8
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:12,762
and demoralized.

9
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,973
>> If we don't become a cohesive

10
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:17,308
team, we will continue to lose.

11
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,935
>> PROBST: Things were so bad

12
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:20,603
that some of the Heroes started

13
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:21,229
to behave like villains.

14
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,189
James bullied the tribe.

15
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,190
>> One voice.

16
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,150
That's all I ask.

17
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,192
Then I get people telling

18
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:26,693
everybody they're wrong.

19
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:27,318
>> PROBST: And J.T. was equally

20
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,236
villainous.

21
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:30,113
>> I'm going to form alliances

22
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,322
with everyone I can.

23
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,657
My strategy is to keep everyone

24
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:33,658
on my side, man.

25
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:34,617
>> PROBST: He made conflicting

26
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:39,539
deals with both James and Tom.

27
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:41,499
At the Villains' camp, Rob's

28
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,251
heroic actions made him the de

29
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,586
facto tribe leader.

30
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:45,879
>> You are the man, and it's

31
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:46,713
like, when you're talking, I'm

32
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:47,589
just hanging on every word.

33
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:48,339
>> I appreciate it.

34
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,466
>> Rob thinks he's the boss of

35
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,092
the camp, but this is my

36
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,844
mountain and I'm still the king

37
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:53,887
of the hill.

38
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:54,888
>> PROBST: Russell got fed up

39
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,890
with his tribe following Rob and

40
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,183
staged a rebellion by hiding the

41
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,184
machete.

42
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,602
>> Getting rid of the machete

43
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:01,144
will cause conflict in this

44
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,688
camp, and that's a good thing.

45
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:04,689
>> PROBST: Go!

46
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:05,565
>> Tom, get him!

47
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:06,566
>> Yeah!

48
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:07,442
Go, go!

49
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:08,151
>> PROBST: But at the last

50
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,652
immunity challenge, everything

51
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,695
changed.

52
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:11,738
Heroes win!

53
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:12,906
The Heroes destroyed the

54
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,365
Villains in a huge blowout.

55
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,201
In addition to immunity, you

56
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,286
have coffee, sugar.

57
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,287
>> Yes!

58
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,830
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

59
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,123
Sandra called out Coach for

60
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,124
being lazy.

61
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,125
>> Coach'll delegate, "You do

62
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,293
this and I'll do this and we'll

63
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,836
go do that," but then when you

64
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,129
look, Coach is gone two miles

65
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:28,338
out.

66
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,297
>> PROBST: But in the end, the

67
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,841
entire tribe voted out their

68
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,176
oldest and most abrasive member.

69
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,428
Randy, the tribe has spoken.

70
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,805
Now, if the Villains can't get

71
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,473
their act together, the Heroes

72
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,099
will even the score.

73
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,184
17 are left.

74
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:57,492
Who will be voted out tonight?

75
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,452
>> Sandra tried to call me out

76
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,203
in Tribal tonight, and it was

77
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,497
just very disheartening.

78
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,499
I'm human, I'm sensitive.

79
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,542
I'm probably more sensitive

80
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:05,959
than most people.

81
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,378
I just hide it behind a lot of

82
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,462
things that I've done and

83
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,255
accomplished and behind a lot of

84
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:14,008
machismo.

85
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,552
What did I do to deserve Sandra

86
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,345
saying that tonight?

87
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,429
There's never been somebody like

88
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,305
me out here and there's never

89
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,223
going to be anybody like me

90
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:23,017
again.

91
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,310
All of this, man, I don't need

92
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,312
it.

93
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,981
I'm ... the man, and I don't

94
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,232
need anybody to tell me or

95
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,233
validate that.

96
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:30,775
I'm the only person out here

97
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:36,114
that will not ... compromise.

98
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,282
(Coach clears throat)

99
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,283
>> I understand where you're

100
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:42,203
coming from, dude.

101
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,376
>> It's unbelievable, man.

102
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,502
Why doesn't anybody ever say

103
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,004
anything good about me?

104
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,923
Am I that bad of a person, man?

105
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,258
Nobody ever does, man.

106
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,301
I'm sensitive.

107
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,886
>> Coach, I know you're

108
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,846
sensitive, dude.

109
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:09,397
>> But, dude...

110
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,399
>> If you want to stick it out,

111
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,151
I'll help you through it.

112
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,193
>> Thanks for coming out here,

113
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,194
man.

114
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,155
>> No problem, dude.

115
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,532
Just let me know how I can help.

116
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,955
I promise you.

117
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:26,956
>> Like what?

118
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,832
>> Don't wear feathers in your

119
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,376
hair at Tribal.

120
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,419
Don't tell your stories.

121
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:31,961
People don't believe your

122
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:32,295
stories.

123
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,005
They mock you.

124
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,381
There's no reason to tell them.

125
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,925
And do your tai chi in private

126
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,052
where nobody can see you.

127
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,098
>> Coach pulled me aside and

128
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,642
said he wanted to go home, but

129
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,935
the Villains do need Coach in

130
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:47,602
the game.

131
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,354
I mean, he's, he's much, much

132
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,647
stronger than the last time he

133
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,107
played physically, and that's

134
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,233
what we need right now.

135
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:54,817
>> I'm telling you, dude, I

136
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,444
don't care what anybody says.

137
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,846
>> When we got back from Tribal

138
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,389
Council, Coach broke down in

139
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,683
tears and said he didn't think

140
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,518
the game deserved his nobility,

141
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,394
and he wanted to quit the game,

142
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,938
so I told him to stick in there

143
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,231
and he knew what he was getting

144
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,232
into.

145
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,401
It's not like any of us are

146
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,111
<i>Survivor</i> virgins.

147
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,195
>> Is he okay, Tyson?

148
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:40,154
>> He's sad.

149
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,447
He talked to me last night and

150
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,490
said he was really thinking

151
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:42,949
about just going home.

152
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:43,491
>> Really?

153
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,492
>> Yeah.

154
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,119
He cried.

155
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:49,372
He was, like, sobbing.

156
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,082
>> I can't believe that.

157
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,667
This morning has been a little

158
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,502
bit of an attitude shift.

159
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,087
Coach had a little sob session

160
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:56,713
with Tyson, wanted to quit the

161
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,631
game or something.

162
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,632
I don't know.

163
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,050
That's not much of a coach, if

164
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,303
you ask me.

165
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,014
What was that all about, man?

166
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:06,639
>> It's just I feel like I'm on

167
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:07,557
the outside.

168
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,642
I want to bond with you, but I

169
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,518
feel like you started playing

170
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:10,810
the game...

171
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,061
>> I'm gonna tell you something

172
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:12,937
right now.

173
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:13,479
You're not on the outside.

174
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,522
Okay?

175
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,859
I'm gonna tell you that.

176
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:18,860
We're good.

177
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:19,485
Look it, it's going to be okay,

178
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,445
for real, man.

179
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,280
Come here.

180
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,114
I know you're hurting.

181
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:23,656
It's all right.

182
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,615
>> I want-- I mean, I, like,

183
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,199
want to, like, sharpen each

184
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,117
other out here.

185
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,076
I want to, like, do stuff

186
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,077
together.

187
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:28,953
>> Then you're going to have to

188
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:29,954
trust me.

189
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,122
Like, literally trust me, and

190
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,165
you're going to be fine.

191
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:32,749
All right?

192
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,833
>> But I feel like the only time

193
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:34,917
you, like, want to bond with me

194
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,002
is when we're getting up for the

195
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,920
challenges, which is cool, and

196
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,130
if that's all you want...

197
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,256
>> I'm not gonna say anymore.

198
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,549
I'm gonna say you have to trust

199
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:42,550
me.

200
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,885
And it's all about this island,

201
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:44,802
all right, so don't worry about

202
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:45,803
it.

203
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,305
Don't sweat it, man, and pick

204
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,556
your ... head up and act like a

205
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,224
man, for real.

206
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,225
All right?

207
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,937
>> All right.

208
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,482
I'm different than most people.

209
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,776
I'm one of a kind.

210
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,778
The last of the Mohicans, King

211
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,572
Arthur-- a legend.

212
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:07,325
Nobody out here has got what I

213
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,619
have.

214
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,412
Confucius says that the greatest

215
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,164
glory a man can have is not in

216
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:13,748
never falling but in rising

217
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,959
again every time he falls, and I

218
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,378
fell hard last night.

219
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,256
You got to be weak to be strong.

220
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,300
There's power in weakness.

221
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:26,803
Today's challenge, you'll see an

222
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:37,313
even fiercer warrior from me.

223
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,357
>> Yay!

224
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,441
>> All right.

225
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,442
>> Whoo!

226
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,485
>> Read it, read it.

227
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,361
>> "Choose from this mountain

228
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:43,945
of goods,

229
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:44,862
Some items to help you improve

230
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:45,446
your life."

231
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,447
>> Yeah.

232
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:46,989
>> "Work like a well-oiled

233
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:47,448
machine,

234
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,992
To alleviate your hardships and

235
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,327
strife."

236
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,578
>> It's the catalog!

237
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,579
>> Whoo-hoo!

238
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,580
>> "Sears: Life. Well Spent."

239
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,625
>> Oh, my God.

240
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,584
>> Yeah, I love that.

241
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,585
>> Yes!

242
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,628
>> What does it say-- how many

243
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,420
we can pick?

244
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,630
>> Two items.

245
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:03,673
>> Fishing kit.

246
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,174
>> Oh!

247
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,134
>> Yes!

248
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:06,759
>> We kind of proved at the last

249
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,053
challenge that we're serious

250
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,429
about this now and we're more

251
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,473
united, and I think it's changed

252
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,933
us as a tribe.

253
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,977
So if the Villains walk away

254
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,353
with this Sears stuff, I'm going

255
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:18,563
to be mad because I don't want

256
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:29,532
to lose momentum.

257
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:34,537
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

258
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,539
Heroes getting your first look

259
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,292
at the new Villain tribe.

260
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,501
Randy voted out at the last

261
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,921
Tribal Council.

262
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,464
All right, you guys ready to get

263
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,048
to today's reward challenge?

264
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:46,632
>> Yes.

265
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,176
>> PROBST: For today's

266
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,719
challenge, you are going to race

267
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,305
head to head as you slide down a

268
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:53,848
slippery course to retrieve a

269
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,308
numbered ball that I will

270
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,727
randomly assign each round.

271
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,478
Once you have the ball, toss it

272
00:07:59,562 --> 00:07:59,854
in your basket.

273
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,064
First person to get their ball

274
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:02,648
in their basket scores a point

275
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,649
for their tribe.

276
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,486
First tribe to four wins reward.

277
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:07,987
Let's get to the reward.

278
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,031
This morning, in your treemail,

279
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,116
you received a Sears circular

280
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,328
with a ton of products to choose

281
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,996
from.

282
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,081
Heroes, you chose a well-

283
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:19,624
equipped tackle box and a

284
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,918
fishing pole and the kitchen

285
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:22,543
set-- everything you need to

286
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,046
catch food, cook food.

287
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,380
Villains, you went a different

288
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,217
route-- a very full tool kit,

289
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,760
along with a tarp, twine, and a

290
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:31,719
multifunction tool-- everything

291
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,721
you guys need to build, I'm

292
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,473
guessing, a better shelter.

293
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,474
All right, Villains, you're

294
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:36,974
sitting out one person.

295
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:37,683
It must be a woman.

296
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,102
Keep in mind you cannot sit out

297
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:40,728
the same person at back-to-back

298
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:41,729
challenges.

299
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:42,563
>> I'll sit out.

300
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,273
>> PROBST: All right, Parvati,

301
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,149
take a spot on the bench.

302
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,652
Draw for matchups, get started.

303
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,157
All right, here we go.

304
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,326
First round-- Coach for the

305
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,787
Villains, taking on Tom Westman

306
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,538
for the Heroes.

307
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,291
You are looking for number 14.

308
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,793
Survivors ready?

309
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,337
Go!

310
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,672
Both guys get a good run.

311
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:11,425
Both guys launch themselves.

312
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,052
A little bit of a battle.

313
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,303
Tom has his.

314
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:18,391
Coach has his.

315
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,392
>> Oh!

316
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,017
>> PROBST: Coach in and out for

317
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:25,064
the Villains.

318
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,650
Tom just misses.

319
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:31,195
Coach scores for the Villains!

320
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,699

You're going for number nine.

325
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,040
Survivors ready?

326
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:43,624
Go.

327
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,043
The more speed, the further you

328
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,336
will go.

329
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,630
Russell not messing around.

330
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,591
Grabs his ball, and he is off.

331
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,468
Cirie having to crawl on her

332
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,803
hands and knees to get to the

333
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:56,762

00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:57,805
Russell with a big advantage

335
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:58,848
now.

336
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,851
A lot of extra time, more shots.

337
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:05,521
Cirie still not here.

338
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:06,522
>> That's it.

339
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:07,523
>> PROBST: Russell scores for

340
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:08,524

Villains lead 2-zip.

342
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,444
>> Good job, Russ.

343
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,945

all.

351
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,417
Courtney with a good slide.

352
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,043
Both women get to their balls

353
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,711
quickly.

354

Got to get the ball in the hoop

Amanda gets there first.

>> Come on, Sandra!

382
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,061
>> PROBST: Survivors ready?

383
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,479
>> No pressure.

384
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,606
>> PROBST: Go!

385
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,652
James, no trouble, grabs the

386
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,195
ball, keeps going, up on his

387
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,447
feet like he's done it before.

388
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,990
Sandra crawling her way to

389
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,867
number five.

390
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,621
James scores for the Heroes!

391
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:48,040
Villains lead, three-two.

392
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,209
Next round, Danielle for the

393
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:50,793
Villains taking on Rupert for

394
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:51,961
the Heroes.

395
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,797
Villains lead it, three-two.

396
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,674
We are playing to four.

397
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,551
If Danielle scores, Villains

398
00:11:58,634 --> 00:11:59,635
win.

399
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:00,970
You're going for number one.

400
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,640
Survivors ready?

401
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:07,810
Go!

402
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,520
Danielle not messing around,

403
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:09,937
launches herself.

404
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,648
Has her ball first.

405
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:13,899
Rupert loses his.

406
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:14,817
Rupert playing with a broken

407
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,569
toe.

408
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,821
Danielle drops her ball now.

409
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,906
Everybody panicking.

410
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,075
Big reward on the line.

411
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,704
Both tribes want it.

412
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,497
Rupert must score to keep the

413
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:28,956
Heroes in it.

414
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,374
>> Come on, Rupert, take your

415
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:30,958
time.

416
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,168
>> PROBST: Danielle can win it

417
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,836
for the Villains.

418
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,463
(frustrated shouts)

419
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,755
The Villains can smell that

420
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,841
reward.

421
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:39,842
Rupert scores for the Heroes!

422
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,969
We are tied, three-three.

423
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:42,803
(Rupert yells)

424
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,514
It's going to come down to one

425
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,932
last point.

426
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,101
Last match-up of this challenge

427
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,978
will be Colby for the Heroes

428
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,021
taking on Tyson for the

429
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,023
Villains.

430
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,941
Winner wins reward for their

431
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,401
tribe.

432
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,029
You're going for number ten.

433
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,281
Survivors ready?

434
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,036
Go!

435
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,000
Donaldson has his ball.

436
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,460
Tyson right behind.

437
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,254
Tyson has his ball.

438
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,631
Donaldson gets off the first

439
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,925
shot.

440
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,259
Just misses.

441
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,179
Tyson... just misses.

442
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,722
>> Come on, Tyson, you got it!

443
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:27,890
>> Come on, Tyson!

444
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,017
>> PROBST: Tyson just misses

445
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,895
again for the Villains.

446
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,439
Both guys very close.

447
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,357
>> You can do it!

448
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,692
>> Come on, Tyson!

449
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:39,985
>> PROBST: Tyson scores for the

450
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,070
Villains!

451
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,197
Villains win reward!

452
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,370
All right, Heroes, I got

453
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,371
nothing for you.

454
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,330
Grab your stuff.

455
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,916
Head back to camp.

456
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,084
Congratulations, Villains.

457
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,169
Come grab your reward.

458
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:57,419
>> Sears!

459
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,088
(whoops)

460
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:12,977
>> Good work.

461
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,894
>> All right!

462
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:17,022
>> Well done.

463
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,983
The challenge was great, and the

464
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,067
dragon slayer's feeling top-

465
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,069
notch.

466
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,529
I'm ready to rock and roll, and

467
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,572
I'm ready to move forward.

468
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,573
Will I change? No.

469
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,824
Will I be the dragon slayer

470
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:27,992
and slay everybody? Yes.

471
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,201
Will I wear my heart on my

472
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:29,910
sleeve every day?

473
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,580
Absolutely, unequivocably, yes.

474
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:37,960
>> Nice.

475
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,879
>> I open the tools, I grab this

476
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,632
serrated blade, and I notice

477
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,634
something in it immediately.

478
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,720
(indistinct chatter)

479
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,393
>> A little note here in this.

480
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,436
>> Uh-oh.

481
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,520
>> There you go.

482
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,646
>> Woops.

483
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,147
>> I thought that it was

484
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,065
something that holds the blade

485
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,025
in place.

486
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,359
I wasn't thinking.

487
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,278
And I'm like, man!

488
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:04,987
I just blew it!

489
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,823
>> "An immunity idol is hidden

490
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:09,116
at your camp, and you have

491
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,160
found the clue.

492
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,661
Head down to the beach to a

493
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,706
crazy palm which juts out over

494
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:16,874
the sea.

495
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,001
Go just beyond it and to the

496
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,836
right and dig around the roots

497
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:21,920
of the double tree."

498
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:22,463
>> So I grabbed the note.

499
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,131
Little did I know it was a

500
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,299
clue to a hidden immunity idol.

501
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,425
Who knew?

502
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,259
There were never any hidden

503
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,385
immunity idols when I played

504
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,387
the game.

505
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:30,971
What do you guys want to do?

506
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,390
We can all go find it and then

507
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,517
do what with it?

508
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,105
>> If you get it, we're going

509
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,399
to write your name down so that

510
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,276
we force you to use it.

511
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,903
It's not fair for one person to

512
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:49,490
have an immunity idol.

513
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,074
>> Rob says we're finding the

514
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,242
hidden immunity idol all

515
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,827
together and we'll get rid of

516
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,704
it, but they're too dumb to

517
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,122
walk even down the beach.

518
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,666
This is a bunch of idiots out

519
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,917
here!

520
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,126
Man, if I could find that

521
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,086
hidden immunity idol, I will

522
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,547
become powerful in this game.

523
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,799
>> Could you guys give me a

524
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:07,800
little help here?

525
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,176
We got to clean all of this, and

526
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,177
we have to make a floor.

527
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,136
>> Okay.

528
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,680
>> And then we can take a piece

529
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,223
of wood and push it out, so

530
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,432
it's more of a shelter.

531
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,433
>> Yep.

532
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,685
>> There's no way that I can

533
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,227
get a clue for the hidden

534
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,771
immunity idol and not find it.

535
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:21,939
That's not going to happen.

536
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,108
So I'm thinking that that's the

537
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,235
palm over the water, and they

538
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,195
have two trees right next to

539
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:36,912
it, so I'm going to find it.

540
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:39,039
>> Okay.

541
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:44,962
>> The question is, is he

542
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,296
really going for a walk, or is

543
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,465
he going looking for the idol?

544
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,388
>> I mean, it sucks, but that's

545
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,557
what we said, right?

546
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,102
>> That's what we said.

547
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,187
We said, if you go for it, then

548
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,188
you seal your own fate.

549
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,315
>> Exactly.

550
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,858
>> Russell's a bonehead.

551
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,151
He's like the hobbit on crack.

552
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,320
And you know what?

553
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,154
I don't trust Russell's ass at

554
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,989
all.

555
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:55,365
And the safest thing to do with

556
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,158
someone like that is to just get

557
00:17:56,241 --> 00:18:16,220
rid of him right away.

558
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,764
>> Oh, me, too, by far.

559
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:19,348
Everybody slept pretty sound

560
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,308
last night.

561
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,189
You can put a little more,

562
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:27,815
maybe.

563
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,107
>> 'Cause it was kind of weak,

564
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:29,858
wasn't it?

565
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,985
>> Mm-hmm.

566
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:37,115
>> Oh.

567
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:37,366
>> Hmm.

568
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,451
>> I wonder what this is?

569
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,869
>> I don't know, but hurry up

570
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,246
and open it.

571
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,248
>> Oh, "An immunity idol is

572
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,290
hidden at your camp...

573
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,252
and you have found the clue.

574
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,670
At the end of your beach,

575
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,797
you'll find the right angle.

576
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,465
In a clearing are three

577
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,134
sections of a tree.

578
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,094
One tall, one fallen, and one

579
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:57,928
on the ground.

580
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,304
Dig under the rock beneath the

581
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,515
90 degrees."

582
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,018
(Tom laughs)

583
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,186
Think one of us was supposed to

584
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,187
find this and not all of us?

585
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,146
(laughter)

586
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,148
>> For real!

587
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:10,691
>> This morning everything

588
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:11,275
changed.

589
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,610
As we poured out the coffee, we

590
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,820
found a clue to a hidden

591
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:15,946
immunity idol somewhere on our

592
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,948
beach.

593
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,283
Colby and I are on the outs

594
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,951
with this tribe with no way to

595
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,953
get in, so we need this to stay

596
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,038
alive in this game.

597
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,793
>> There went J.T.

598
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,259
>> Hmm.

599
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,386
(laughs)

600
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,851
>> I think I'll go this way.

601
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,273
>> Damn!

602
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:04,411
>> We searched the first

603
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:05,370
clearing.

604
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,664
I moved to the next one,

605
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,499
immediately saw a leaning tree,

606
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,001
a fallen tree, an upstanding

607
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:11,543
tree, forming a triangle.

608
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,795
Everybody was going to see it,

609
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,589
I felt, so I had to get down

610
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,674
and try to get it first.

611
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,094
James arrived.

612
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:21,637
I moved to a different spot,

613
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,722
'cause I could see that the sand

614
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:24,598
was a little loose.

615
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:25,807
I knew I was on it.

616
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,894
So I dug quickly.

617
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,395
And while nobody was looking,

618
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,356
I found the immunity idol,

619
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,316
dropped it into my sock.

620
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,026
Now, a few more people are on

621
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:36,735
the scene.

622
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,153
We got... Candice is over there.

623
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:39,237
It's getting a little crowded,

624
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,739
and I have no idea what to do

625
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,866
with this thing.

626
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,287
>> Tom, he was acting a little

627
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,914
funny, and when I came up on

628
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,165
him, I saw him put something

629
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,416
into his sock, and then he went

630
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,460
behind a tree.

631
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:56,421
So I knew he had it.

632
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,923
>> Like, there's a lot of rocks

633
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,969
under here.

634
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:05,889
>> Tom has it.

635
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:06,890
>> Aw, shucks.

636
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,225
>> You know, we were getting

637
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:08,934
along so good.

638
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,227
Now this is going to make

639
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,313
everybody crazy again.

640
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:19,903
>> She did? All right.

641
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,405
>> The hidden immunity idol

642
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,406
changed the whole playing

643
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,782
field, and that's all we needed.

644
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:24,741
We needed an opening.

645
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,159
Tom and I needed an opening to

646
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,203
get back in this game.

647
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:30,038
Granted, neither Tom nor

648
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,081
myself, we're not comfortable.

649
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:31,623
But we're in a little bit

650
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,458
better of a position than we

651
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:37,629
were a couple of days ago.

652
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,589
>> Yeah, right, what a morning.

653
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,521
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

654
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,282
All right, you guys ready to get

655
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,284
to today's immunity challenge?

656
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,285
>> Let's do it.

657
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:09,327
>> PROBST: First things first,

658
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,287
J.T.

659
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,372
Give it up.

660
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,250
Once again, immunity is back up

661
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,418
for grabs.

662
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,461
For today's challenge, one

663
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,921
person will be strapped inside a

664
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,423
giant ball.

665
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,217
That person must then guide two

666
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,844
other tribe members, who will be

667
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:26,595
blindfolded, as they push the

668
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,388
ball down a long, winding

669
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:32,017
course to a table maze.

670
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:32,642
The person inside the ball must

671
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,353
then guide four other tribe

672
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,521
members, also blindfolded, as

673
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,857
they maneuver the ball through

674
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,192
the table maze to the finish

675
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,318
hole.

676
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,570
First tribe to finish wins

677
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:44,738
immunity, lives to see another

678
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,740
day.

679
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,825
Losers go to Tribal Council.

680
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,577
Somebody will be voted out.

681
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,329
This entire season, we've been

682
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,622
doing classic challenges from

683
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,458
past seasons of<i> Survivor.</i>

684
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,001
This challenge is classic for

685
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,127
another reason.

686
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,462
This is the only challenge in

687
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,839
the history of<i> Survivor</i> to not

688
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:03,840
be completed.

689
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,217
It was stopped last season due

690
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,718
to a medical emergency.

691
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,386
So although Russell has run

692
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,138
this challenge, one of these two

693
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:10,722
tribes will get the honor and

694
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,431
distinction of being the first

695
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,141
tribe to win it.

696
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,101
Villains, you're sitting out

697
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,102
two people in this challenge.

698
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,103
Who's sitting out?

699
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,104
>> Courtney and Sandra.

700
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,105
>> PROBST: Courtney and Sandra

701
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,147
sitting this one out.

702
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,107
Heroes, you're sitting out one

703
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,108
person.

704
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,109
Who's it going to be?

705
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,110
>> Cirie.

706
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,111
>> PROBST: Cirie sitting out

707
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,112
for the Heroes.

708
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,113
Sit-outs, take a spot on the

709
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,072
bench.

710
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,574
Give you a minute to strategize,

711
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,786
we'll get started.

712
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,621
All right, stepping up and

713
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,374
leading for the Villains is Rob.

714
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:37,999
Tom calling the shots for the

715
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:38,667
Heroes.

716
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,670
Here we go, for immunity.

717
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,673
Survivors ready?

718
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:45,632
Go!

719
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:46,675
>> Doing good, doing good.

720
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,552
>> PROBST: Heroes off to a quick

721
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:49,636
start.

722
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:50,637
>> Keep doing what you're doing.

723
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,097
>> PROBST: Tom is guiding Rupert

724
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:52,764
and James.

725
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:53,765
>> You're ahead of them and

726
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,142
just control.

727
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,309
>> PROBST: Boston Rob is guiding

728
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,686
Coach and Tyson.

729
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,687
>> Together, together, together!

730
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,646
Together, together, together!

731
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:00,689
>> Move to push, James! Go!

732
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,482
>> PROBST: We're neck and neck

733
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,483
right now.

734
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,985
>> ...Tyson, now. Tyson now.

735
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:05,986
Tyson now. Tyson now.

736
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:06,945
>> PROBST: Villains now in the

737
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:07,946
lead.

738
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:08,905
>> Come on, guys, move it now,

739
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:09,865
move it now.

740
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:10,907
We're wide open, wide open.

741
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:11,908
Wide open.

742
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,243
(thudding)

743
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,703
>> PROBST: Rob takes a big hit

744
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,662
on that tree.

745
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:16,705
>> Together.

746
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:17,664
>> ...take the turn, hard left!

747
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:18,707
>> Keep going.

748
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,666
There you go. Come on!

749
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:20,667
>> That's good.

750
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,668
A little towards Rupert.

751
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:22,669
A little faster.

752
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:23,545
They're just a little ahead of

753
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:23,712
us.

754
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:24,504
>> A little speed.

755
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,505
Coach's side, Coach's side.

756
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,506
>> PROBST: Villains very close.

757
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,507
>> Right to the side.

758
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,508
>> PROBST: Take off your

759
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,468
blindfolds, Coach and Tyson.

760
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,052
>> Okay, take 'em off, guys...

761
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:31,511
Take 'em off.

762
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,512
>> PROBST: Get him in a position

763
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,514
so he can see, and then you can

764
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,474
start calling shots.

765
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,434
>> Right there.

766
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:38,435
Okay, Parvati, down.

767
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:38,977
>> PROBST: Rob is guiding

768
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,271
Parvati, Russell, Danielle and

769
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,272
Jerri.

770
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,190
>> Okay, good.

771
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,274
>> PROBST: Heroes are now here.

772
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,233
>> I'm in.

773
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,234
>> PROBST: Take off your

774
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,945
blindfolds, get him oriented.

775
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:49,905
>> Get me straight.

776
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:50,947
J.T. and Amanda, down to the

777
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:51,740
left a little bit.

778
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,159
>> PROBST: Tom guiding Colby,

779
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,411
Candice, J.T. and Amanda.

780
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:57,746
>> A little more, a little more,

781
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,955
a little more.

782
00:24:59,039 --> 00:24:59,915
Okay.

783
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,291
>> Danielle, slowly lift it up.

784
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:02,709
Russell down.

785
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,336
>> PROBST: If they're right, the

786
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,337
Villains have a bit of a lead.

787
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,422
>> I want Danielle and Russell

788
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:08,423
to come up at the same time.

789
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:09,424
Now.

790
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:12,177
Good. Don't move, don't move.

791
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:12,802
>> Colby and Candice towards my

792
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:13,553
voice now.

793
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,554
Towards the guys, towards the

794
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:15,555
guys.

795
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:16,556
A little more, a little more,

796
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,017
a little more, and a hard left.

797
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,018
Hard. Yes! Great!

798
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,061
>> There's a little gate here,

799
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,020
so this is going to be the

800
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,021
tricky part, 'cause we can't let

801
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,314
it go through.

802
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:25,815
Parvati up, up.

803
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:29,527
Russell, up, up, up.

804
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,528
Good, good.

805
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:30,862
Don't move...

806
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,530
>> PROBST: Rob with a big move

807
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:32,948
for the Villains.

808
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:33,573
>> All right, we want to go hard

809
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:34,574
towards the ladies.

810
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,702
Hard towards the ladies.

811
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,497
Yes! Great! Perfect!

812
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,122
>> PROBST: Tom with a nice move

813
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:41,790
for the Heroes.

814
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,750
>> Russell and Danielle, slowly

815
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:44,751
up.

816
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:45,752
Parvati up.

817
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:46,795
Okay, don't move, don't move,

818
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:47,754
don't move!

819
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:48,755
>> PROBST: Very close now for

820
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:49,756
the Villains.

821
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:50,757
>> Keep going now.

822
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,425
Amanda's corner down, J.T. up.

823
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,551
>> PROBST: Heroes close.

824
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,552
>> Jerri down, Jerri down.

825
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:55,553
Oh!

826
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,054
>> Down towards Amanda.

827
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,555
Oh! No!

828
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:58,556
>> Jerri, up, up, up.

829
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,557
And we got it.

830
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,558
>> We got it!

831
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,559
>> PROBST: Villains win

832
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:01,810
immunity!

833
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:02,644
(cheering)

834
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,645
>> Oh, my God!

835
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,563
(screaming)

836
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:06,564
>> I can't do anything.

837
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:10,026
(indistinct chatter)

838
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,736
>> Hey, can someone help me out?

839
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,406
>> Good job, Rob.

840
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:15,365
>> Good team work.

841
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:16,992
Good team work.

842
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:17,742
>> PROBST: All right, Rob, you

843
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,078
stepped up in a very gutsy

844
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,454
position as caller.

845
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:21,705
Paid off.

846
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:22,622
Immunity... for the Villains.

847
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,582
>> Yay!

848
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,585
(applause)

849
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,211
>> PROBST: Heroes, you have the

850
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,587
afternoon to figure out who's

851
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:30,588
going home.

852
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,548
Grab your stuff, head back to

853
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,549
camp.

854
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:33,675
I will see you at Tribal.

855
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,677
>> We're going back to Tribal

856
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,763
Council, and getting rid of

857
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,015
Colby or Tom tonight would be

858
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:40,640
the smart thing to do.

859
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,934
They have been on the outs with

860
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,686
our tribe since maybe day three.

861
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,647
And for my game, I need some of

862
00:26:47,731 --> 00:27:02,412
these strong people gone.

863
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,789
(sighing)

864
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:05,790
>> I'm sorry, guys.

865
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:06,791
>> No, you had the hardest damn

866
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,877
job of it all.

867
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,384
>> The challenge was a

868
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,510
heartbreaker.

869
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,346
Colby and I are low men on the

870
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:21,139
totem pole within the tribe, and

871
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,849
the last thing I need is to be

872
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:23,933
marching off to Tribal Council

873
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,018
tonight.

874
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,478
I have the immunity idol, but

875
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,146
I'm still a target, because they

876
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,564
know it's in my possession.

877
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,775
So my game right now is biding

878
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,360
my time and, uh, looking for the

879
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,570
little cracks in their alliance

880
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:36,905
that we can use to save our

881
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:41,910
necks.

882
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:42,911
>> This is good, I think, for

883
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:43,912
us.

884
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:47,123
>> Mm-hmm.

885
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,292
Um, if we split the votes three

886
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,293
and three...

887
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,294
>> Mm-hmm.

888
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,337
>> ...on Tom and Colby...

889
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,338
>> Mm-hmm.

890
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:54,297
>> ...and Tom plays the idol...

891
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,298
>> Uh-huh.

892
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,341
>> ...Colby goes home because

893
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:57,300
he's the one with the next most.

894
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,301
Okay?

895
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,552
If Tom doesn't play the idol,

896
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:00,512
that would force a tie between

897
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,846
the two of them.

898
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,808
Then the rest of us vote four on

899
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:05,809
one and two on the other...

900
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:06,851
>> So, let me just get this

901
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:07,769
straight-- tie-breaker.

902
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:08,728
And they can't vote at all.

903
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:09,813
>> And they can't vote at all.

904
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:10,814
>> Oh, so we're good.

905
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:11,856
>> So, if he plays the idol,

906
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,899
then, yeah.

907
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:13,900
>> So either way, we're good.

908
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:14,859
>> Right.

909
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:15,902
We're going to Tribal Council

910
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,362
tonight, and we kind of have a

911
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:18,363
plan of what we want to do.

912
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:19,739
Tom has the idol, and we need

913
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,908
to be extra careful right now.

914
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,452
But as long as we're all on the

915
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,704
same page, yeah, theoretically,

916
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:30,417
it should work out.

917
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,011
>> Yeah, but he's not going to

918
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,012
hurt us.

919
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,013
>> It just scares me because

920
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,014
Tom's smart, you know?

921
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,015
>> I'm just telling you, I

922
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:46,766
trust him a hell of a lot more

923
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,767
than I trust Candice.

924
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,145
I would love to have Tom and

925
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,689
his idol in alliance with me,

926
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:53,690
no doubt.

927
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:54,691
Tom and Colby are both

928
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:55,692
shoot-you-straight kind of

929
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:55,900
guys.

930
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:56,776
They look you in the eye, shake

931
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,944
your hand, tell you how they

932
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,863
feel, and you can take it to the

933
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:00,864
bank.

934
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:01,948
>> Hey, there.

935
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:02,949
>> But I'd rather have someone

936
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:03,992
like that I can count on than

937
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:04,951
Candice.

938
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:05,952
The scrambling, the running

939
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:06,953
around she's done the past

940
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:07,954
couple of days.

941
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:08,955
I don't trust her as far as I

942
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:09,956
can throw her.

943
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,499
>> So I'm trying to figure out

944
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,125
what makes sense to you and you

945
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:12,917
and James.

946
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,795
And Colby and I, as partners,

947
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:16,796
definitely makes more sense.

948
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,339
I think you have two guys who

949
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:18,965
are going to be honest, and two

950
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,134
guys who are going to compete

951
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:21,843
better than Cirie and Candice.

952
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:22,802
>> Mm-hmm.

953
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:26,347
>> My concern is that because

954
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,474
there is an immunity idol...

955
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,016
I wish there wasn't one, and

956
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,268
I'm trying to figure out how to

957
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,019
get that stain off of me.

958
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:31,978
>> Why don't you just give me

959
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:32,979
your word that immunity idol's

960
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:33,980
not going to be used against us

961
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:34,981
or something.

962
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,858
>> Oh, no, no.

963
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,818
I swear to God, we'll play that

964
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:39,861
thing as a committee.

965
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,280
If there was no idol, I'd feel

966
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,573
much better about this.

967
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:44,782
The idol is scaring me.

968
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,534
I can give it to you if one of

969
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,869
you wants it, and then it's your

970
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:48,912
idol.

971
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,622
>> With Tom having the immunity

972
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,790
idol, he's either a big threat,

973
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,168
or someone great to work with.

974
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,586
I'm a little leery of him,

975
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:57,879
because Tom has voted for me in

976
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,422
Tribal Council, but he was ready

977
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,049
to give us the idol, and there's

978
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,008
a part of him that I really do

979
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:05,011
think is honest.

980
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,223
>> We were just talking about

981
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,807
that.

982
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:10,975
>> I don't really trust Candice.

983
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,021
>> I like her, but she's too

984
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,022
scatter-brained.

985
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,065
>> I mean, I just want to win.

986
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,024
I just want the strongest team.

987
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,025
>> I want to win, too.

988
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,068
>> That's what I want, too.

989
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,027
I am totally trusting you here,

990
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,028
Tom.

991
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,029
>> Okay. Come here.

992
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,030
You know, I've been trying to

993
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,031
ingratiate myself with the

994
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,324
powers that be, and I had a

995
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:27,617
little something to bring to the

996
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,660
table at this point, so a

997
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,204
supposed new alliance was born,

998
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,205
but I don't believe or trust

999
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,206
anybody in this game, so we'll

1000
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:36,417
see.

1001
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,260
>> Mm-hmm.

1002
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,261
>> He's, like, "Well, I don't

1003
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,303
even want this thing.

1004
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,304
I just want to be here.

1005
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:49,305
I'll even give it to one of you

1006
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,265
guys..."

1007
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,392
>> Mm-hmm.

1008
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,728
>> That is the dumbest thing.

1009
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:58,815
Did he give it to you?

1010
00:30:58,898 --> 00:30:59,816
>> Amanda.

1011
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,651
These are the same people that

1012
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:02,735
wanted you gone desperately.

1013
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:03,736
>> I know.

1014
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,737
>> Desperately.

1015
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:05,947
And now you're going to save

1016
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,782
them?

1017
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:09,367
This is so stupid.

1018
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,827
Tom and Colby, and they're a

1019
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,162
much bigger threat than she is.

1020
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,163
Can you beat them?

1021
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:17,083
Oh, my God!

1022
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:20,420
Amanda-- I love her to death,

1023
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:22,005
but she is not the sharpest tool

1024
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,006
in the shed.

1025
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,549
My alliance-- they're so

1026
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:24,924
wishy-washy.

1027
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,009
Like, these people, like, panic

1028
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:26,968
and do crazy stuff.

1029
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,095
Why didn't you tell me the plan

1030
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:31,306
was changing?

1031
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,141
Unbelievable! Unbelievable!

1032
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,438
If she was so untrustworthy,

1033
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,564
your girl right here wouldn't

1034
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:40,607
be standing here now.

1035
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,983
With this one, at least we can

1036
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:42,984
keep her under control.

1037
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,027
>> Well, no.

1038
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,320
We haven't made up the final

1039
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,362
decision yet, though, babe.

1040
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,363
>> I know.

1041
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,364
Come on.

1042
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,158
Tom is very charismatic.

1043
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,659
He's very athletic.

1044
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,828
He's already won this game once

1045
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:54,871
before.

1046
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:55,496
Why keep someone like that in

1047
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,164
the game?

1048
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,333
It makes no sense. It's crazy.

1049
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,418
>> Cirie is right.

1050
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,427
Amanda wants to do it, but

1051
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,428
Cirie's talking the rest out

1052
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,597
of it.

1053
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,181
At this point, you need to get

1054
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,266
your idol out, get it, because I

1055
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,727
ain't got any control any more.

1056
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,729
Cirie's the mastermind behind

1057
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:20,730
this whole deal.

1058
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:21,731
>> You know what?

1059
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:22,899
I thought that we had this thing

1060
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:23,900
solid this afternoon.

1061
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:24,984
Amanda-- after she talked to

1062
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,028
Cirie-- she broke faith, and

1063
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,655
this deal was off.

1064
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,448
Cirie's the puppet master, and

1065
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,241
she's got her arm jammed up

1066
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,035
there, so it could be the end

1067
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,162
of us.

1068
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,837
>> They're going to vote three

1069
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,130
for me, three for you.

1070
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,141
>> There you go.

1071
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,019
>> I've got to make a big

1072
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,062
decision, a very big decision.

1073
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:04,107
I've seen Cirie operate.

1074
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,192
I know how she plays.

1075
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,902
And it won't be long before she

1076
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:10,071
gets rid of someone like me.

1077
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,197
>> I think we do three and three

1078
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,281
to keep Candice in and keep our

1079
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:12,573
six strong.

1080
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,074
Yes?

1081
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,075
>> Yep.

1082
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,660
>> All right.

1083
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,411
>> And we're not going to

1084
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,495
discuss it no more.

1085
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:18,746
>> My gut's telling me to just

1086
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,581
go with the flow, write Colby's

1087
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,999
name down, and don't piss

1088
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,126
everybody off, and my heart says

1089
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,420
I'm going to keep the good guys

1090
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,212
in the game and get rid of

1091
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:29,507
Cirie, but you listen to your

1092
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,801
heart, you get hurt out here, so

1093
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:32,969
it's all up to me.

1094
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:33,594
I know where everybody over here

1095
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:58,202
is voting, except me.

1096
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,329
>> PROBST: So, last time you

1097
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:01,873
guys were at Tribal Council, you

1098
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,249
voted out Steph, which seemed a

1099
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,251
little surprising, given that

1100
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,919
you've lost now three out of

1101
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,629
four immunity challenges.

1102
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,673
So, Tom, where is the philosophy

1103
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:11,299
of the tribe in terms of voting

1104
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,509
people out?

1105
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,218
>> Stephenie was on the wrong

1106
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,679
side of the numbers formed on

1107
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:17,680
day one.

1108
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,766
She was with the wrong group, so

1109
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:20,183
she was sacrificed.

1110
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,143
>> PROBST: So, Colby, if this

1111
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,353
game is already about alliances,

1112
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,813
is it inevitable that great

1113
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,148
people are going to go home

1114
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,524
early merely because they're on

1115
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,275
the wrong side of the numbers?

1116
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,570
>> It's unfortunate, but that

1117
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:33,237
looks to be what's going to take

1118
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,238
place.

1119
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,908
>> PROBST: J.T., where is the

1120
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:39,452
wisdom in having alliances this

1121
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:40,995
early that cause you to vote out

1122
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:41,579
somebody strong merely because

1123
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:43,414
they're on the wrong side of the

1124
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,916
numbers?

1125
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:45,500
>> It's way too early to vote

1126
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,585
out people that should get used

1127
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:48,628
to beat the other tribe.

1128
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,296
It's way too early for that, but

1129
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:51,714
unfortunately all of these

1130
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,424
people here are good and they

1131
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,675
all have reasons why they should

1132
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,259
be here.

1133
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,219
>> PROBST: So then what do you

1134
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:57,720
base the vote on?

1135
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:58,346
>> It's pretty simple-- you got

1136
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,389
to have people that's not going

1137
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,432
to get scared.

1138
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,683
They're going to stick to what

1139
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,185
they promised you to begin with.

1140
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,228
>> PROBST: Rupert, how about

1141
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:06,187
you?

1142
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:06,771
What are you basing your vote

1143
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:07,355
on?

1144
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,941
>> Trying to figure out how the

1145
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,276
heck we can bond together in

1146
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,530
these challenges and win.

1147
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,824
But...

1148
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,745
I made alliances that-- and

1149
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,747
promises that I want to keep.

1150
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:25,915
>> PROBST: So it sounds like

1151
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,375
what you're saying with that

1152
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,877
long pause is: "Not sure it will

1153
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,504
be the best vote, but I will be

1154
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:34,006
keeping my word."

1155
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:34,549
>> That is exactly what I am

1156
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,299
saying.

1157
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,009
I am keeping my word.

1158
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,010
>> PROBST: Wow.

1159
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,262
>> I am going to stand up to

1160
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:39,554
what I said.

1161
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,681
>> PROBST: What part of that

1162
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:42,807
makes sense?

1163
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,100
Keeping your word in a game

1164
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:44,642
called "Outwit, Outplay,

1165
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:45,643
Outlast"?

1166
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,103
Keeping your word because I'm an

1167
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,354
honorable man and I want people

1168
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,856
to see me that way?

1169
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,148
'Cause I'm looking at a tribe

1170
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,483
who-- you all keeping your word,

1171
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,484
great.

1172
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,402
All it's doing is giving you

1173
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,361
more time with me at Tribal

1174
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:56,362
Council.

1175
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,655
>> And sitting here at Tribal

1176
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,240
Council sucks, and I know I j...

1177
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,284
>> PROBST: You're a part of the

1178
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,118
reason, based on that

1179
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:02,785
philosophy, Rupert.

1180
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,328
>> I know I am.

1181
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,873
>> PROBST: That's the most

1182
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,624
honest and illuminating answer

1183
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:09,417
we've had in any of our Tribals

1184
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,795
together.

1185
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,255
So, Cirie, how worried are you

1186
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,257
tonight that you might be going

1187
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,258
home?

1188
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,302
>> I'm always worried, always.

1189
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,345
>> Tom, do you believe Cirie is

1190
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,388
worried that she's going home

1191
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:23,431
tonight?

1192
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,765
>> I believe that Cirie is not

1193
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:25,808
worried that she's going home

1194
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:26,809
tonight.

1195
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:27,727
>> PROBST: Colby, are you

1196
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,812
concerned you're going home?

1197
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:30,813
>> Without question.

1198
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,440
It's going to take a bold move

1199
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,316
to save me tonight.

1200
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,442
>> PROBST: James, how you voting

1201
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,443
tonight?

1202
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,069
>> We need to win.

1203
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:37,695
I want gifts.

1204
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:38,279
I want that food.

1205
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:38,779
I want to hold the idol.

1206
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,531
I want to do all that good

1207
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:40,907
stuff, you know?

1208
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:41,490
>> Are you going to base your

1209
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,867
vote on that tonight?

1210
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:43,492
>> Yes, yes, sir.

1211
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:44,035
>> What you just said you

1212
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:44,410
wanted?

1213
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:45,995
>> Yes, sir.

1214
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:46,996
>> Okay.

1215
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,122
>> I want everybody to stop all

1216
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:49,665
this crazy stuff and to win.

1217
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:50,666
>> PROBST: What's the crazy

1218
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,709
stuff?

1219
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:52,335
>> Just the whole social thing.

1220
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:53,294
The social game is a

1221
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,253
distraction.

1222
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,923
James don't do this stuff.

1223
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,299
>> But, James, it's a necessity

1224
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,092
if your name is the one on the

1225
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,636
top of the list to go home.

1226
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,762
>> Yes, sir, I hear you.

1227
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,181
>> I agree, it's not fun, but

1228
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,974
it's necessary when you're the

1229
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:07,516
one faced with leaving, you

1230
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,852
know.

1231
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,938
>> PROBST: J.T., how concerned

1232
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,356
are you that you're going home?

1233
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,441
>> I don't feel like I'm going

1234
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,734
home tonight, and a lot of

1235
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:17,818
people are going to hate me for

1236
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:18,444
saying it, but if I didn't trust

1237
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:20,488
the people that I put my trust

1238
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,739
in tonight, I probably would

1239
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,824
already be gone, and I mean, I

1240
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:24,867
trust these people I'm in

1241
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,786
alliance with tonight.

1242
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,829
>> PROBST: Well, there's a lot

1243
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,666
of talk tonight about trust and

1244
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,250
an equal amount of apparent

1245
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,543
dissension, so I'm really

1246
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,170
curious to see how the vote

1247
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:37,213
plays out.

1248
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:37,672
It is time to vote.

1249
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:41,550
Rupert, you're up.

1250
00:37:57,274 --> 00:37:59,193
>> I think you're a great guy,

1251
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,528
but hopefully it's you and not

1252
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,613
me tonight.

1253
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,295
>> Love you as a person, but

1254
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,380
you're way too good at wrapping

1255
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,923
some of these really weak minds

1256
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:24,301
around your little finger.

1257
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,160
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1258
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,579
votes.

1259
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,508
Once the votes are read, the

1260
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:05,509
decision is final.

1261
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,677
Person voted out will be asked

1262
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,095
to leave the Tribal Council area

1263
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,096
immediately.

1264
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,265
I'll read the votes.

1265
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:12,600
>> Jeff.

1266
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,643
I have something that I was

1267
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:15,978
hoping not to use until this

1268
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,521
team was able to use it against

1269
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,190
the Villains, but evident in

1270
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,775
camp today was I needed it to

1271
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:24,570
save myself, so... I'd like to

1272
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:27,323
play the immunity idol.

1273
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:31,869
>> PROBST: Thank you.

1274
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:32,620
The rules of<i> Survivor</i> state that

1275
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,580
if somebody plays the hidden

1276
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,332
immunity idol, then any votes

1277
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,459
cast against them will not count

1278
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,752
and the person with the next

1279
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,087
highest number of votes will be

1280
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,088
sent home.

1281
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,172
This is, indeed, a hidden

1282
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:43,756
immunity idol.

1283
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,423
Any votes cast for Tom will not

1284
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:45,424
count.

1285
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:49,053
I'll read the votes.

1286
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,599
First vote-- Tom.

1287
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:57,228
Does not count.

1288
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,190
Tom.

1289
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,776
Does not count.

1290
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:08,239
Tom.

1291
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:09,281
Does not count.

1292
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,534
Nobody still has any votes.

1293
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,790
Colby.

1294
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:20,709
That's one vote-- Colby.

1295
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,838
Colby.

1296
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,674
Two votes-- Colby.

1297
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,511
Cirie.

1298
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,513
Two votes-- Colby, one vote--

1299
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:37,309
Cirie.

1300
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,352
Cirie.

1301
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:39,603
Two votes-- Colby, two votes--

1302
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,397
Cirie.

1303
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:46,193
One vote left.

1304
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,444
Fourth person voted out of

1305
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:47,862
<i>Survivor: Heroes vs.</i>

1306
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:51,866
<i>Villains...</i>

1307
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,784
Cirie.

1308
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,661
You need to bring me your torch.

1309
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:11,218
Cirie, the tribe has spoken.

1310
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,389
Time for you to go.

1311
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,151
Well, I would say that qualifies

1312
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:28,485
as your first blindside.

1313
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,486
Should make for a very

1314
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,487
interesting next few days.

1315
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,530
Grab your torches, head back to

1316
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:32,531
camp.

1317
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,700
Good night.

1318
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:45,586
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1323
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:54,887
dragon slayer chi.

1324
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:55,429
Everybody went, except for

1325
00:41:55,512 --> 00:41:55,721
Russell.

1326
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,431

1327
00:41:57,514 --> 00:41:58,140
immunity idol while Rob hunts

1328
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,141
Russell.

1329
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,017
>> If you go out there looking

1330
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:00,935
for it, you're a marked man.

1331
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:01,685
>> PROBST: Candice makes a game-

1332
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:02,478

>> I want to work with Tom and

1334
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:03,646

>> PROBST: And as the

1336
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,106
competition gets more fierce,

1337
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,107
another castaway goes down.

1338
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,192
Hold up, let the docs take a

1339
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:10,361
look.

1340
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,201
>> Maybe I said too much or

1341
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,245
stepped on J.T.'s toes, but I

1342
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,121
couldn't just sit back and play

1343
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,414
J.T.'s game.

1344
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,541
I'm playing this game for myself

1345
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,835
as well, so I couldn't do it.

1346
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,295
I don't blame them at all.

1347
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,422
I felt like I was gotten with

1348
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,465
one of my moves.

1349
00:42:31,548 --> 00:42:33,175
You know, my hats off to them.

1350
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,260
They got me.
