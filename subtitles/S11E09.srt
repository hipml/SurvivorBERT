00:00:01,292 --> 00:00:02,961
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:04,337
<i>Survivor:</i> Yaxha and Nakum

3
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:05,505
merged in the dead of night.

4
00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:06,715
>> We have some new buffs for

5
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:07,716
you.

6
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:08,925
>> Merge, baby, merge.

7
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:10,093
>> PROBST: The old Yaxha members

8
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:12,137
felt outnumbered.

9
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,888
>> There's four of us from Yaxha

10
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,640
tribe and six of them from the

11
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:16,641
Nakum tribe.

12
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:17,642
And things aren't looking very

13
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:18,643
up.

14
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,019
>> PROBST: Tree mail brought

15
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,479
word of a small immunity idol

16
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,897
hidden nearby in the jungle.

17
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,023
>> "There is an individual

18
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:24,607
immunity idol in the woods."

19
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,568
>> "You can use it at any time

20
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:27,402
to save yourself.

21
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:28,778
You don't need to tell anyone

22
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:29,404
you have it, but if you're going

23
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:31,322
to use it, you must present it

24
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,198
before the vote."

25
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,241
>> PROBST: And the search was

26
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:34,242
on.

27
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:36,202
>> We got tree mail saying that

28
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,287
there's a little immunity idol

29
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,081
about this big in the jungle

30
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,375
that's this big.

31
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,918
>> PROBST: At the immunity

32
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,378
challenge, Survivors chose

33
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:46,254
between competing for individual

34
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:48,298
immunity or partaking in a

35
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,257
feast.

36
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,091
If you participate in the

37
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,719
challenge, you don't eat.

38
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:53,678
>> Oh, my God.

39
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,722
>> PROBST: Jamie made clear the

40
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,223
tribe divide as he harassed

41
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,224
Bobby Jon.

42
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,184
>> Brandon and Bobby Jon know

43
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,685
they have a chance of going home

44
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,811
tonight 'cause they're the best

45
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:02,812
two athletes in the group.

46
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:03,897
>> I thought we were one tribe.

47
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,898
>> You know we're not one tribe.

48
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:05,899
So why you saying that right

49
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:06,900
right now?

50
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,318
>> Because I can.

51
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,152
>> PROBST: In the tie-breaking

52
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,195
round, Gary took home individual

53
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,613
immunity.

54
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:12,781
Gary wins immunity.

55
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,449
>> PROBST: Back at camp, Jamie

56
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:15,450
revealed that Brandon's time was

57
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,451
up.

58
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,452
>> You say that, but you know

59
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,453
Brandon's head is on the

60
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,454
chopping block.

61
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:20,872
>> PROBST: But some of Jamie's

62
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,540
old allies were fed up with

63
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,541
him...

64
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,542
>> Dude, shut up, man, shut up,

65
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:25,543
man.

66
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:26,544
I can't listen to you right now.

67
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,545
>> PROBST: ...giving Brandon a

68
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,421
glimmer of hope.

69
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,422
>> People have been saying...

70
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,423
>> This is<i> Survivor.</i>

71
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,841
Things get switched around.

72
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:32,425
It'll change.

73
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,927
You know, something will happen,

74
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:34,803
and something's starting to

75
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:35,804
happen.

76
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,222
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

77
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,098
Bobby Jon and Jamie were once

78
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,767
again at each other's throats.

79
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,267
>> That's just no class.

80
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,770
>> No one says I have no class.

81
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,063
You know, that's just

82
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:45,897
disrespectful.

83
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,397
Man, just shut up, dude.

84
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,107
I mean, God!

85
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,234
>> PROBST: Okay, before we get

86
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,652
to the vote, the immunity idol

87
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:51,486
was hidden at your camp.

88
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,154
If anybody has found that, now

89
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,823
is the time to present it.

90
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,407
When no one produced the idol,

91
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,117
the votes were close between

92
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:58,535
Jamie and Brandon.

93
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,161
But, in the end, it was Brandon

94
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,371
who was sent home.

95
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:06,167
Brandon, the tribe has spoken.

96
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,418
Nine are left.

97
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:11,548
Who will be voted out tonight?

98
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:15,051
(theme song playing)

99
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:16,052
Captioning sponsored by

100
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:17,053
CBS PARAMOUNT

101
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,098
NETWORK TELEVISION

102
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:31,753
>> I don't know.

103
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,838
It's bull when you call... when

104
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,757
you say someone has no class.

105
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,134
You shouldn't judge another man.

106
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,135
You know?

107
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:39,761
>> Yeah, but just take some time

108
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,179
and, like, you know, don't

109
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,180
react.

110
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,598
Like, we're all making the jury,

111
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:44,891
and, like, let's just take

112
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:48,937
tonight and sleep.

113
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,520
>> I'm not, man.

114
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,855
>> You don't want to go to bed

115
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:51,689
angry, man.

116
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,899
That ain't a good thing to do,

117
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:53,816
bro.

118
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,817
>> I'm not angry.

119
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:55,818
My feelings are hurt.

120
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:56,819
>> I called Jamie out at Tribal

121
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,029
Council, and it really got to

122
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:58,655
him because he knows I told the

123
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,447
truth.

124
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,116
I mean, the kid showed no class

125
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,618
today, none, whatsoever.

126
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,410
>> Why did you say I have no

127
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,495
class?

128
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,623
>> Because at the time we were

129
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,167
competing and, you know, you're

130
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,752
rooting another person on that's

131
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:13,503
competing right beside them to

132
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,755
me, and I may have a wrong

133
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,382
opinion, and if I do, I'm sorry,

134
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,466
but it was, that's how it came

135
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,593
off to me, you know, hey.

136
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,594
(chuckles)

137
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,137
>> My action might have had no

138
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:23,680
class, but saying I have no

139
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,556
class is like calling me white

140
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,557
trash, Bobby Jon.

141
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,018
>> That was just because that's

142
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,312
how I felt at that moment today.

143
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,314
Tomorrow the sun comes up.

144
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,315
>> It broke my heart.

145
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:34,524
It did.

146
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,275
>> I'm sorry.

147
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,652
I don't mean to break anybody's

148
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:38,653
heart.

149
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:39,654
>> I don't think he was judging.

150
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:40,405
He wasn't judging you.

151
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,614
I think he was just saying at

152
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,615
that moment.

153
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,741
>> You're taking it a little too

154
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:44,617
personal, man.

155
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,660
>> I don't understand how this

156
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:46,703
wouldn't hurt y'all's feelings.

157
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,578
>> 'Cause... you know why?

158
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,663
Because this is competition, and

159
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:49,747
some things... you say things

160
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,748
when you don't mean it.

161
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:51,749
You just say it.

162
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,750
>> Are we cool?

163
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:53,376
>> I hate all the drama, but I'm

164
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,502
just straight up telling you.

165
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,046
>> Well, hey, speak your heart.

166
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,881
>> Hallelujah.

167
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,049
>> Jamie took it way too

168
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:00,383
personally.

169
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,510
I think he was just looking for

170
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:03,845
some kind of outlet for all the

171
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:04,470
emotion he was feeling, and the

172
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,681
way for him to do that was to

173
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:07,932
kind of blame Bobby Jon.

174
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,767
And if Jamie doesn't use this as

175
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:10,393
an experience to learn and

176
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,104
change from, then I'm going to

177
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,356
change up this game.

178
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,150
>> If I left tonight, I don't

179
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:17,734
know, God, what I would have

180
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,443
done.

181
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,444
I would be swimming in

182
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:24,657
depression.

183
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:28,494
(tapping)

184
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,715
>> Breakfast is ready.

185
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:41,758
Judd?

186
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,593
>> I'll pass on eating today,

187
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,803
man.

188
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,472
Other than the food, camp life

189
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,473
is great, man.

190
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,474
I mean, at this point of the

191
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,559
game, we're up in numbers, so, I

192
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,478
mean, we got 6-3 right now, so

193
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,064
the most vulnerable now is

194
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,774
Danni, Gary, and Bobby Jon.

195
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,650
And they know they are.

196
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:05,865
>> Exactly.

197
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,200
>> Listen, if it was the other

198
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:07,825
way around, they'd be doing the

199
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:08,951
same thing.

200
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:09,619
>> Mm-hmm.

201
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,454
(laughter)

202
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:15,583
>> Yeah.

203
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,590
It's got to be here somewhere.

204
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:27,261
Our ass depends on it.

205
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,262
>> I need that immunity idol

206
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,263
now.

207
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,600
I need it right now.

208
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,519
It's going to be tough.

209
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,229
Um, all I know from the clues is

210
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:36,813
that it's visible, but it's

211
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,481
going to be hard to find.

212
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,065
But that's the only chance I

213
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:39,565
have.

214
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,235
I'm on the chopping block.

215
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,070
There's pretty much nothing I

216
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,114
can do to budge the magical six

217
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:46,489
up there.

218
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,365
What do you do?

219
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:51,410
You just got to keep trying.

220
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,331
>> It's hopeless.

221
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:56,582
We can't find it anywhere.

222
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,459
Hopefully, we'll get some more

223
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,378
clues to where it might be.

224
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,504
But I'm just praying.

225
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,547
So maybe the Lord will lead me

226
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:07,510
to it.

227
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,053
>> In the NFL, we played

228
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,930
against Detroit one year, and we

229
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,557
were down by 20-some points.

230
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,474
I threw for close to 300 yards

231
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,726
in one quarter, and we came back

232
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,395
and won in the last part of the

233
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,396
game.

234
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,397
And that's how I'm approaching

235
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,398
this game.

236
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,440
I'm going to pull out everything

237
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,900
I can to try to get as far as I

238
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:23,901
can.

239
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,403
If it gets me there, it gets me

240
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,404
there.

241
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,405
If it doesn't, I'll feel

242
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,741
comfortable the way I played.

243
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:48,843
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

244
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,386
How's everybody doing?

245
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:51,387
>> Pretty good.

246
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:51,804
>> Good.

247
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,347
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

248
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,390
to today's challenge?

249
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:54,849
>> Yes, sir.

250
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,392
>> PROBST: Today's challenge is

251
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:57,560
for reward, and it will test

252
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,895
your ability with a weapon

253
00:07:58,978 --> 00:07:59,770
called the atlatl.

254
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:00,855
This is an indigenous Maya

255
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:01,856
weapon.

256
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,316
It was used to give warriors

257
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,775
more distance when they would

258
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,110
toss a spear in battle.

259
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,487
Today, you're going to use it to

260
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,573
throw an arrow toward a target,

261
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,574
in this case, the center pole.

262
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,618
Each person gets only one throw.

263
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,495
The person who ends up closest

264
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,496
to the target wins this

265
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,497
challenge.

266
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,498
Make sense?

267
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,541
Want to know what you're playing

268
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,542
for?

269
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,543
>> Yes.

270
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,544
>> Yeah.

271
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:24,545
>> PROBST: You are playing for

272
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,546
food.

273
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,631
And the good news is, everybody

274
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,342
here will eat today.

275
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:29,634
>> Oh, good.

276
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,303
>> PROBST: The bad news is what

277
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,138
you eat will depend on how well

278
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,556
you do in this challenge.

279
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,724
You will leave here and go to a

280
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,559
lodge where you will find nine

281
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,811
meals waiting for you.

282
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:44,482
First place gets the best meal.

283
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,901
Last place gets the worst meal.

284
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:50,446
I'll tell you this: first place:

285
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:50,821
steak and lobster.

286
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,573
(gasping)

287
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:52,907
>> Oh, my God.

288
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,660
>> PROBST: Last place is not.

289
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:59,330
In addition, the winner of this

290
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:02,041
challenge gets one clue to the

291
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,751
location of the hidden immunity

292
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:04,669
idol.

293
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:05,670
>> Wow.

294
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:06,671
>> PROBST: Worth playing for?

295
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:07,672
>> Yes.

296
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,631
>> Uh-huh.

297
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,632
>> PROBST: We'll draw for

298
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,760
position, and we'll get started.

299
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:13,594
All right.

300
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,054
First up, Judd.

301
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,055
>> What do you, say, Judd?

302
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,181
Knock 'em out, buddy.

303
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,099
(applause)

304
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,100
>> PROBST: Judd readies his

305
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,726
toss.

306
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,603
Judd is going to set the mark to

307
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,399
beat.

308
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,526
Good-looking toss.

309
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:28,776
>> Wow.

310
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:29,652
>> Nice.

311
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,111
>> Nice throw, Judd.

312
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:34,073
(applause)

313
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,117
>> That's really nice.

314
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,618
God.

315
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,037
>> PROBST: Judd, just a little

316
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:40,871
over seven feet.

317
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:41,664
Judd has set the mark to beat.

318
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,124
Bobby Jon.

319
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,417
>> Come on, Bobby Jon.

320
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,876
>> PROBST: Take a good toss to

321
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,630
beat Judd.

322
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,048
Not going to do it.

323
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,342
Take the second-place spot next

324
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:53,843
to Judd.

325
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:54,844
>> Good job.

326
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,555
>> PROBST: A little room to play

327
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,556
with.

328
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,765
Judd and Bobby Jon first and

329
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:00,182
second right now.

330
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,726
Rafe's up.

331
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,811
Feeling confident?

332
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,646
>> Um, I am aiming for medium-

333
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,065
range food today.

334
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,278
(chuckling)

335
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,112
>> PROBST: Nice toss.

336
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:13,946
>> Nice toss, Rafe.

337
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,156
>> Good job, Rafe.

338
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:15,781
>> PROBST: Well, Rafe, you're

339
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,284
eating better than Bobby Jon.

340
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,452
That's what we know.

341
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,661
Cindy up next.

342
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,664
Judd in first, Rafe in second,

343
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:24,957
Bobby Jon in third.

344
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:25,750
Cindy would like to knock

345
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:31,130
everybody down one peg.

346
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:31,380
Nice toss.

347
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,798
>> Oh, nice toss, Cindy.

348
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:33,799
>> Good job, Cindy.

349
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:34,550
>> Nice job.

350
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:35,551
>> PROBST: That's going to be

351
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:36,552
very close.

352
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:38,846
Cindy just outside of Judd.

353
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:39,889
Judd stays in first.

354
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,807
Cindy becomes second, Rafe

355
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:42,808
third, Bobby Jon fourth.

356
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:43,809
Lydia.

357
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,770
>> Come on, Lydia.

358
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:46,187
>> Come on, Lydia.

359
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,188
Let's go.

360
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:47,813
>> PROBST: Lydia, you got to get

361
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,232
closer than Bobby Jon, or you're

362
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:50,816
going to end up with the worst

363
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,904
meal.

364
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:59,408
>> I got the worst meal.

365
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,035
>> PROBST: Take a spot next to

366
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,328
Bobby Jon at the end.

367
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,914
>> Corn soup.

368
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:05,289
>> PROBST: Danni.

369
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:05,748
>> Come on, Danni.

370
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,250
>> PROBST: Judd still the mark

371
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,127
to beat.

372
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:10,920
Danni with a nice toss.

373
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,005
>> Oh, nice throw, Danni.

374
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,006
>> Wow.

375
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,007
>> PROBST: Danni moves into

376
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,008
third.

377
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:16,884
>> Good job.

378
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:17,843
>> Good job, Danni.

379
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,720
>> PROBST: Gary, take your best

380
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:20,721
shot.

381
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,057
>> Come on, Gary.

382
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,058
>> PROBST: Gary takes a nice

383
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,434
toss.

384
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,561
>> Wow.

385
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,397
>> PROBST: Very close between

386
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,440
Gary and Rafe.

387
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,860
It's Gary by a few inches.

388
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:35,945
Gary slides into fourth.

389
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,781
Rafe, Bobby Jon, Lydia move down

390
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:39,365
a spot.

391
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:44,954
Stephenie.

392
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,706
Stephenie with a good launch.

393
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,124
>> Good job, Steph.

394
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,209
>> PROBST: Might move her ahead

395
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,752
of Gary.

396
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,838
Steph moves into fourth place.

397
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,840
Gary, Rafe, Bobby Jon, Lydia,

398
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,091
take a step down.

399
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,676
>> You definitely beat me.

400
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:03,013
>> PROBST: Jamie, you're up.

401
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,974
You know the mark to beat.

402
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:08,561
A lot of food to be had.

403
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,895
Steak and lobster at the top.

404
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,272
Something much less desirable at

405
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,148
the bottom.

406
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:16,152
Currently, Lydia is eating that.

407
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,241
Jamie doesn't knock Judd out.

408
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,367
>> Way to go, Judd.

409
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:23,951
>> Good job.

410
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,036
>> Good job, Judd.

411
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,496
>> You deserve it, man.

412
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,208
You deserve it.

413
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,836
>> PROBST: Jamie, you are just

414
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,796
outside of Danni and in front of

415
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,006
Stephenie.

416
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:37,965
Jamie, take your spot at number

417
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,008
four.

418
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,385
>> If it's all the same to you,

419
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,720
Jeff, since I had such bad

420
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,054
actions yesterday, I'd like to

421
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,764
take the last-place meal and let

422
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,057
all the other people move up.

423
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,059
>> PROBST: You want to swap your

424
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:49,351
position?

425
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,603
>> Yes, sir.

426
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,104
>> PROBST: Do it.

427
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,898
>> Thanks, Jamie.

428
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:57,109
>> Sorry about that yesterday,

429
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:57,776
guys.

430
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:03,073
>> Good job.

431
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:03,949
>> Jamie, you're all right.

432
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,993
>> PROBST: Jamie, this is a way

433
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,287
to make up for yesterday?

434
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,538
>> We're one tribe now.

435
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,873
I'm sorry I didn't see that

436
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:11,874
sooner.

437
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,083
>> PROBST: Rafe, how does that

438
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:13,918
gesture sit with you?

439
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,002
>> I think it shows Jamie

440
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,378
learned a lot and it's awesome.

441
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:16,962
>> PROBST: Jamie, did you talk

442
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,839
to anybody about doing this?

443
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:19,840
>> No, sir.

444
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:20,841
>> PROBST: Did you plan on doing

445
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:21,842
it all along?

446
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,302
>> I felt in my heart if I

447
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,929
didn't do better than some other

448
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,138
people, then I should give it

449
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,139
up, yes.

450
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:27,932
>> PROBST: Well, the result of

451
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,934
what you gave up we'll find out

452
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,728
soon, but I promise you, you

453
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,021
gave up a lot moving from fourth

454
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,022
to ninth.

455
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,023
We're going to head over to the

456
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:36,941
lodge.

457
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,400
Nine meals await.

458
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:38,901
Judd, steak and lobster.

459
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,153
>> Nice, Judd.

460
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,112
>> PROBST: Let's head out.

461
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:45,199
Follow me.

462
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,000
>> PROBST: Come on in, Judd.

463
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,210
You're right here.

464
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:59,338
Everybody else fall in.

465
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,923
Big man gets his own table.

466
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,968
And Jamie, on the end, as he

467
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,010
wished.

468
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,305
Pepito and puppies, they live

469
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,056
here.

470
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,891
Good to be king, huh?

471
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,560
>> Oh, man, feels great, Jeff.

472
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,561
>> PROBST: Let's don't waste any

473
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,562
time.

474
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,104
Bring out the meal.

475
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,940
Steak and lobster for Judd.

476
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,108
>> Oh, my God.

477
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,735
(applause)

478
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,696
>> Oh, man.

479
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,115
>> Whoa, look.

480
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,908
>> PROBST: Judd is going to have

481
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:28,701
a good night.

482
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,452
>> Judd, take your time, buddy.

483
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,954
>> PROBST: All right, Cindy,

484
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:32,997
let's bring out your food.

485
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,747
>> Oh, my God.

486
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,331
>> PROBST: Big plate of food,

487
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,666
chicken, veggies.

488
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,793
>> I cannot even believe this.

489
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:38,752
>> Oh, my God.

490
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:39,753
It's more than ample.

491
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:40,379
>> PROBST: Danni, you ready for

492
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,755
yours?

493
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,881
>> Oh, yeah, bring it on.

494
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,091
>> PROBST: Let's bring out the

495
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,843
next meal.

496
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,137
>> Spaghetti?

497
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,556
>> A big pile of it.

498
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,223
>> Danni.

499
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,058
>> It has meat in it.

500
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,184
>> PROBST: Bring out the next

501
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:54,393
meal.

502
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,020
>> Oh, nice.

503
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:56,937
Burger and a beer.

504
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:01,442
Jamie, I believe that was yours.

505
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,776
This is where you would have

506
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,987
been in the line, Jamie.

507
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,905
>> Nothing tastes better than my

508
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:07,573
self-respect.

509
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,866
>> PROBST: Well put.

510
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,951
Bring out the next meal.

511
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:14,913
Slice of pizza for Gary.

512
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:15,998
Bring out Rafe's meal.

513
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,751
Ham and cheese sandwich.

514
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:19,752
>> I'm happy.

515
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:20,169
I still got meat.

516
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,129
>> PROBST: Bobby Jon, I know

517
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,256
you're hungry.

518
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,841
Baked potato.

519
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:26,884
>> That will work, man.

520
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:27,885
>> PROBST: Lydia, you

521
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,011
moved up a spot, thanks to

522
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,012
Jamie.

523
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,305
>> I don't feel like I deserve

524
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,766
it, even if it's one cracker.

525
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:34,350
>> PROBST: Bring out the next

526
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,727
meal.

527
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,688
How appropriate is this?

528
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,773
>> Oh, a fish.

529
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:41,190
>> Wow.

530
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:41,982
>> Wow, that's great.

531
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,734
Thank you.

532
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,110
>> PROBST: Is it really great?

533
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,697
>> It's great because I expected

534
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,490
a cracker.

535
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,491
Thank you.

536
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:51,742
>> PROBST: Bring out the last

537
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,744
meal.

538
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,621
Jamie wanted this.

539
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:56,997
You moved yourself down to the

540
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,624
bottom to try and make up for

541
00:15:58,707 --> 00:15:59,792
some remarks you made.

542
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:00,376
You get the least desirable

543
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,670
meal.

544
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,004
Ramon nuts.

545
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,757
>> Yeah, and dirty water, nice.

546
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,635
>> PROBST: Ramon nuts and water

547
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,011
from your lake.

548
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,179
It has been boiled.

549
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:12,513
>> Thank you.

550
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,097
Appreciate that.

551
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,973
>> PROBST: Okay.

552
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,975
Two spots on either side of you

553
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:17,351
open for invite.

554
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:20,104
If you would like to invite one

555
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,356
or two people to sit with you,

556
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,066
here's what they would get:

557
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,861
the open bar, same as you.

558
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,822
They also get dessert menu, same

559
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,907
as you.

560
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,826
>> This is a tough call, man.

561
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,619
But soon as I walked in the

562
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,663
game, just his arms wide open,

563
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:38,205
definitely Bobby Jon.

564
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,165
>> PROBST: Bobby Jon, come up.

565
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,460
Have a seat.

566
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,213
Who's going to sit here?

567
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,132
>> Another one, you know, soon

568
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:51,009
as I got in the game, man, she

569
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,928
just opened up and welcomed me

570
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:54,471
like you couldn't believe.

571
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,055
Stephenie.

572
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,807
>> PROBST: Stephenie, bring your

573
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,978
food over.

574
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,147
So have a good night.

575
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,440
No sharing over here.

576
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,983
What you do here is up to you.

577
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:06,900
The bar is open.

578
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:07,484
Dessert when you're ready for

579
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,193
it.

580
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,571
One last thing, for you and you

581
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:11,572
only, a clue to the hidden

582
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:11,905
immunity idol.

583
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:12,865
>> Thank you.

584
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:13,907
Thank you very much.

585
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:14,408
>> PROBST: Well-earned.

586
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:14,783
Bon appetit, guys.

587
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,243
>> Good night, Jeff.

588
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,245
>> So I move over to the king

589
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,873
table, and Judd orders a round

590
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:24,752
of drinks for all of us.

591
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,170
And I split my cheeseburger,

592
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,838
gave Bobby Jon half and Judd

593
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:28,464
split his steak and gave Bobby

594
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,549
Jon half and we all shared the

595
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,550
lobster.

596
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:32,760
It was like heaven.

597
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,137
It was unbelievable.

598
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,890
>> I was just craving spaghetti

599
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:44,271
last night, craving everything.

600
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,273
>> It was a total nine-course

601
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:46,899
dinner.

602
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,609
But I didn't gorge and pig out,

603
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:49,610
though.

604
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,487
I didn't want to do that because

605
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,363
I kept looking up at Gary, and I

606
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,198
could see the anguish on his

607
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:57,076
face, like he really had a small

608
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,744
slice of pizza, and he really

609
00:17:58,827 --> 00:17:59,536
wanted to eat.

610
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,580
I tried to be respectful as I

611
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,123
could when I was eating.

612
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,666
>> I'll take a vodka.

613
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,126
What are you drinking?

614
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,211
>> Vodka, cranberry, but I'm

615
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:07,961
going to get....

616
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:08,420
>> Two of them.

617
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,713
You know what, when you make the

618
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:10,589
vodka, double up on it.

619
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,090
Throw a whole load of vodka and

620
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:17,513
just a little bit of cranberry.

621
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,473
>> Gary, you're killing me over

622
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:19,765
there, kid.

623
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,099
>> Why, man?

624
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,100
I'm enjoying watching you.

625
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,101
>> No.

626
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,186
>> You're killing me, dude.

627
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,687
I can't even look at you, man.

628
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,939
>> I won't look at you anymore,

629
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:27,940
Judd.

630
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,107
>> It was two hours of watching

631
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:29,691
them gorge themselves and get

632
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,317
drunk.

633
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,611
That's just not my idea of fun.

634
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,278
>> You were giving it one of

635
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,488
these.

636
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,907
>> I'm always throwing it up,

637
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,241
all the time.

638
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:41,328
(chattering, laughing)

639
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,167
>> Yeah!

640
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,419
>> You got it, buddy.

641
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,672
Judd, a little slower, hon.

642
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:52,881
>> Okay, we're there.

643
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,007
>> Thank you, Gary.

644
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,050
>> Good job, Judd.

645
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,134
>> Love you.

646
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,679
Love you like a fat kid loves

647
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,055
cake, brother.

648
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:02,432
I finally get to hug my boy

649
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,475
right here.

650
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,144
Yeah.

651
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,353
>> Judd was pretty well drunk.

652
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,396
He was jovial for a while.

653
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,314
Then Bobby Jon thought he was

654
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,649
going to move this stump to the

655
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,235
fire.

656
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,156
>> Well, it was a 30-foot tree.

657
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,824
>> Ready?

658
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,326
>> One, two, three.

659
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:25,372
>> Wait a minute.

660
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,665
>> You stay here.

661
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,918
Me and you will... whoa.

662
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,839
>> Let's get it in the morning.

663
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,632
>> We're fine.

664
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,718
>> Give me your hand, Judd.

665
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,637
>> I got it.

666
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,861
>> Oh, my gosh, snoring and

667
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:56,570
throwing up.

668
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,362
>> Who threw up?

669
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:57,988
>> Judd.

670
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,239
You got sick, didn't you, last

671
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,240
night?

672
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,743
That was you?

673
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,038
>> No, I got up and went over

674
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:06,622
there in the ruins somewhere.

675
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,290
>> No, you didn't.

676
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,042
You threw up right in the

677
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:10,417
shelter.

678
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,835
>> He threw up right next to the

679
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:12,836
wall.

680
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,297
>> It's all a blur to me, man.

681
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:19,468
>> Did you get it?

682
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,761
>> Yeah.

683
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:21,762
>> Did you read it?

684
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:22,429
>> Is it good?

685
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,347
>> With my reward, the steak and

686
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,682
lobster, I also won a note

687
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,351
giving me a clue to where the

688
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,061
idol is around the jungle.

689
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,896
Now, when it comes to keeping a

690
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,607
secret, man, I can't do it.

691
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,488
>> The clue actually says, "This

692
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,074
idol still eludes you.

693
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,784
It seems nowhere to be found.

694
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,953
It's not buried or concealed nor

695
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,245
directly on the ground."

696
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,997
>> It's got to be like in a

697
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,374
tree.

698
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,375
Judd let me read the clue.

699
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,418
I felt really honored that he

700
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,087
would even think to do that.

701
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,630
Basically what it said is it's

702
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,631
not on the ground.

703
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:58,966
If you find this, you're

704
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:02,260
definitely in the final four.

705
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,978
>> Say something, man, tree

706
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,521
mail, I got in my pocket, man,

707
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,357
that thing is definitely by far

708
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,358
on the ground, so to speak.

709
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,528
I mean, I can't give away too

710
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,947
many clues because I'm trying

711
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,032
save my own ass, but it is

712
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,784
totally on the ground.

713
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,119
>> Thanks, Judd, because

714
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:27,494
that's...

715
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,288
>> I've been looking in trees.

716
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,664
>> I went back to camp and I

717
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,332
told everybody, man, it's on the

718
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,917
ground, it's on the ground.

719
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,252
It ain't on the ground.

720
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,628
It's in a damn tree somewhere.

721
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:37,337
I don't have a problem lying to

722
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,463
the other guys at all.

723
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,799
That's what the game's about,

724
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:44,094
man.

725
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,775
>> Okay, your turn.

726
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,028
>> I'm with our plan still.

727
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,696
You know what I'm saying?

728
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,781
I want you to promise you won't

729
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:05,615
kick me over.

730
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,825
I'll promise you.

731
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,577
>> I'm not going to, Jamie.

732
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,911
>> I swear I won't.

733
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:10,662
I mean that.

734
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,205
So just stay with me.

735
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,000
>> Okay.

736
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,129
>> No, we're fine.

737
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:19,921
>> Okay.

738
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,089
>> Jamie is paranoid all the

739
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,090
time.

740
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,925
He's always saying, "You're not

741
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,302
going to vote against me, are

742
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:25,510
you?"

743
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,971
I wish I could say that I

744
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,848
thought what he did by taking

745
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,808
the lowest meal was an act out

746
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,685
of the goodness of his heart.

747
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:34,519
I don't know if it was.

748
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,397
I don't really think it was.

749
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,524
And so, you know, I don't...

750
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:43,111
I don't trust Jamie.

751
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,241
>> I think we're getting rid of

752
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:48,742
Bobby Jon.

753
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:49,826
>> First?

754
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,827
>> Yeah.

755
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:51,828
>> You've been honest with me

756
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:52,829
the whole time.

757
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:53,497
>> Yeah.

758
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:53,872
>> Just tell me.

759
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,373
>> Yeah.

760
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,375
>> You can be pissed at me,

761
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:56,750
whatever.

762
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:57,084
I don't care.

763
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,878
I do care, but...

764
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,089
Okay?

765
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,882
I mean, I have to.

766
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,342
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

767
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,510
>> I mean if I don't, I'm dead.

768
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,470
>> Yeah.

769
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,305
>> Okay.

770
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:10,847
>> I told Jamie that I would

771
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,682
vote for whoever they're voting

772
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:13,892
for tonight, just because it

773
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,185
would be stupid for me to get

774
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:15,769
them any more mad at me than

775
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,145
there already are.

776
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,396
And there's no breaking that

777
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:18,688
six.

778
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:28,406
>> He's voting against me.

779
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:28,865
>> That's interesting.

780
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,992
I don't know why he told me.

781
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:31,660
That he just said he's being

782
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,037
honest with everybody and he

783
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,497
wanted everybody to know he's

784
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,873
voting against me today.

785
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:37,582
>> Huh.

786
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:41,169
>> Jamie swears that Gary said,

787
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,629
if you don't mind, I'm going to

788
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,423
cast a vote for you tonight, and

789
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,632
we were like, "You sure you

790
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,300
understood?" because sometimes

791
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,802
he's a little... and he's like,

792
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,804
"Yeah."

793
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,435
>> Yeah, no.

794
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:57,978
I'm out.

795
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,272
>> I think something shady is

796
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,565
going on every time somebody's

797
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,943
talking.

798
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:09,823
The paranoia sets in.

799
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,619
>> Maybe he is losing it a

800
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:15,912
little bit out here, like for

801
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:16,997
real.

802
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,331
>> He definitely is.

803
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,583
>> Like in a real way.

804
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,834
>> Uh-huh, totally.

805
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,128
>> I really see Jamie as a huge

806
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,504
liability and a threat to all of

807
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,840
us because he's just not all

808
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:27,841
there.

809
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,051
He seems like a loose cannon.

810
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,095
I feel like he can ruin our

811
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,472
entire plan.

812
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,892
I hate walking to tree mail.

813
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,351
>> It's a hike.

814
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,019
>> Yeah.

815
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:41,021
>> "Balance, speed, dexterity,

816
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,522
There's lots of need to worry.

817
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:43,690
Move too slow, you could lose it

818
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:44,691
all,

819
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,193
And be first to join the jury."

820
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,903
It didn't say about wrestling or

821
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:48,653
fight anybody.

822
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:49,946
>> That's hard for me.

823
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,324
I feel like it could tip over

824
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,074
right now.

825
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,036
Oh, well, I'll do my best.

826
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:03,126
>> Gary's balancing over there.

827
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,169
>> He sure is.

828
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,629
>> He told me today he's voting

829
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,422
against me.

830
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:09,382
>> I wouldn't worry too much

831
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,967
about it.

832
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,802
>> I'll vote him out, too.

833
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,721
That's his... trying to vote me

834
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,890
out.

835
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:17,641
The game is getting paranoid.

836
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:20,060
Your mind wonders if people are

837
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,436
going to change your vote.

838
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,896
Stephenie and Rafe could change

839
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,481
over to Bobby Jon and Danni's

840
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:25,941
side and Gary's side and they'd

841
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,276
have the numbers right now.

842
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,611
>> I don't know why he did that.

843
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,820
>> You got nothing to worry

844
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:31,988
about.

845
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:32,572
>> I feel pretty vulnerable,

846
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,033
because I never can

847
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:35,992
figure out exactly what

848
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:36,701
everybody's thinking.

849
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:37,661
I know I have the numbers, but

850
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:40,080
people change real quick.

851
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:40,664
This jungle, man, people start

852
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,041
thinking and start thinking too

853
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,542
much.

854
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:45,669
And then it can all come back

855
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:48,505
around on you.

856
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:14,864
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

857
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,367
First things first.

858
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:21,121
Gary.

859
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:24,624
Immunity back up for grabs.

860
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,835
Today's challenge will test your

861
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,629
coordination and your balance.

862
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,840
On my go, all nine of you will

863
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,050
make your way across a balance

864
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,344
beam, untying two wooden planks

865
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,012
as you go.

866
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:37,679
Only the first four tribe

867
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,639
members to cross the finish line

868
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,641
with their two planks move on to

869
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,561
the next round.

870
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,479
For the next round, you will use

871
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,315
those two wooden planks to help

872
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,108
you move across a knotted rope

873
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:50,650
bridge.

874
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,069
The first two to reach the

875
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,487
platform moves on to the final

876
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,280
round.

877
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,407
For the final round, you must

878
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,326
navigate a two-line balance

879
00:26:59,409 --> 00:26:59,743
bridge.

880
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,037
You fall in the water, you go

881
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,496
back to the start.

882
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,498
First person to reach the finish

883
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,833
platform wins immunity.

884
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:07,625
Make sense?

885
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:08,251
>> Yes, sir.

886
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,962
>> PROBST: We'll get started.

887
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,884
For immunity, first four to

888
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,094
finish move on to the next

889
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:18,303
round.

890
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:22,015
Survivors ready?

891
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:22,349
Go!

892
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,809
Got to cross the balance beam

893
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,479
and untie two wooden planks.

894
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,689
Got to untie every knot.

895
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,483
See what you have learned after

896
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:31,775
24 days.

897
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,568
Jamie going to sit down.

898
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:35,153
Doesn't want to risk it.

899
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,112
Remaining calm.

900
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,238
Big part of this.

901
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,115
Stephenie working through those

902
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,242
knots quickly.

903
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,744
Gary has his first plank.

904
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,745
He's moving on.

905
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,247
He almost loses it, but keeps

906
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,875
his balance.

907
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,668
Steph goes over and she's got to

908
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:51,127
go back to the start.

909
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,172
Rafe has his first plank undone.

910
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,216
Jamie has his first plank,

911
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,218
scooching across that balance

912
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:58,676
beam.

913
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,219
That's going to feel good.

914
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:02,639
Danni has her first plank.

915
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,557
Cindy, Bobby Jon both have their

916
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,308
first planks.

917
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,435
Judd and Lydia both now have

918
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,770
their first planks.

919
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,522
Everybody working on their

920
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:13,608
second plank.

921
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:14,818
Bobby Jon falls off.

922
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:15,819
He's got to go back to the

923
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:20,740
start.

924
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:21,783
Judd, got to go back to the

925
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:22,283
start, man, your foot.

926
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:22,742
>> Come on!

927
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:25,745
>> PROBST: Gary almost has his

928
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,915
second plank untied.

929
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,750
Steph has her second plank

930
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:31,418
untied.

931
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:31,960
She can keep her balance.

932
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,879
She's moving on.

933
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,840
Stephenie moving on to the next

934
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:37,340
round.

935
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,883
Three more people are moving on.

936
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,428
Gary trying keep his balance,

937
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,470
and he does.

938
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,596
Gary moving on.

939
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,015
Two more moving on.

940
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,809
Jamie's going to be one of them.

941
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:48,977
And here's Rafe.

942
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:53,022
That's the four moving on.

943
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,984
Moving on to the next round.

944
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,820
Here we go, guys.

945
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,030
Jamie, Steph, Rafe, Gary, going

946
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,907
to use your planks to move

947
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,660
across this rope bridge.

948
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:07,162
Two people moving on in this

949
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:07,871
round.

950
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:10,039
Survivors ready?

951
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:10,206
Go!

952
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,251
Got to balance your weight with

953
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,043
each step.

954
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,171
Low center of gravity going to

955
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,797
be key.

956
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:18,882
Gary falls off.

957
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:21,468
He's back to the start.

958
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:26,389
Rafe doing very well.

959
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,849
Jamie hanging on.

960
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:31,811
Steph hanging on.

961
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,771
Gary trying to get back in this.

962
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,064
Immunity at stake.

963
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,650
Still a long way left to go.

964
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:40,528
Time can be made up.

965
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,030
Steph and Rafe in the lead.

966
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:46,034
Jamie pulls ahead of Steph.

967
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,661
Gary trying catch up.

968
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:54,250
Rafe, a good system.

969
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,545
Jamie hanging on.

970
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,632
Rafe getting closer and closer.

971
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,426
Two people moving on.

972
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,886
Gary falls off.

973
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,596
He's out of it.

974
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,848
Rafe very close.

975
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:12,477
Rafe moving on.

976
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:12,936
>> Good job, guys.

977
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,854
(Stephenie grunts)

978
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,482
>> PROBST: Jamie moving on.

979
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,609
Rafe and Jamie in the final for

980
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:22,695
immunity.

981
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:25,156
Last leg.

982
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:25,990
Two-line balance bridge.

983
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,076
First one to cross the finish

984
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,037
wins immunity.

985
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,955
Survivors ready?

986
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:32,288
Go!

987
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:35,333
First person to get two feet on

988
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,794
the finish platform wins

989
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:38,670
immunity.

990
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,004
Jamie's got a great system

991
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,422
going.

992
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,299
>> Good job, Jamie.

993
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,217
>> Rafe, hang in there.

994
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,177
>> PROBST: Rafe struggling...

995
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,053
but hangs on.

996
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:50,557
>> Take your time, Rafe.

997
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,058
>> PROBST: Jamie moving quickly.

998
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:55,103
>> Good job, Jamie.

999
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,025
>> PROBST: Rafe dangling, dips

1000
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,027
in.

1001
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,737
Rafe's out.

1002
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:05,113
Rafe in the water.

1003
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,073
Got to go back to the start.

1004
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,867
Jamie very close to winning

1005
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:10,076
this.

1006
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,953
Just like that.

1007
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,831
Jamie wins immunity.

1008
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,583
>> Good job, Jamie.

1009
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,294
Good job, Rafe.

1010
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,296
>> PROBST: Well-earned.

1011
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,464
>> Good job, Jamie.

1012
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,340
>> PROBST: Nice job.

1013
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,091
Jamie safe at the vote tonight.

1014
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:27,135
Everybody else fair game.

1015
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,470
Tribal Council, see you there.

1016
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,515
Head on back to camp.

1017
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,289
>> Hmm?

1018
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:57,624
>> I don't like to lose.

1019
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:58,416
I'm so competitive.

1020
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:01,252
>> I hated today.

1021
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,591
>> Yeah, he told me that he was

1022
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:07,133
going to vote for me. Yep.

1023
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:09,177
The reason he needs to go is

1024
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,386
because he's so headstrong.

1025
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:10,928
>> Yeah.

1026
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,263
Cool, I'm sticking to the

1027
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,849
plan.

1028
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:19,729
>> Uh-huh.

1029
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:20,480
>> Okay?

1030
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:21,606
>> Perfect.

1031
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,399
If anything changes, let us

1032
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,233
know.

1033
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,151
>> Today, Jamie won immunity,

1034
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,904
and, um, I was actually getting

1035
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:28,988
really frustrated with him.

1036
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,823
You know, I was thinking maybe

1037
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,575
we could get rid of him and be

1038
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:33,201
okay, but he won immunity, so

1039
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,911
it's definitely out.

1040
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:35,536
But we've got a great plan in

1041
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,204
place, and we're going to get

1042
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:41,042
rid of Gary first.

1043
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,168
>> He needs to go because

1044
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:44,170
he's head-gaming everybody.

1045
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:44,796
>> Good.

1046
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,255
So are you in with that?

1047
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,049
>> Now we have it.

1048
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,510
It's the perfect thing.

1049
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:50,760
>> Uh-huh.

1050
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,053
>> Why does this seem too easy,

1051
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:52,637
though?

1052
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,638
I'm getting nervous, like

1053
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,140
something bad's going to happen.

1054
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,726
Gary, he's a huge physical

1055
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,395
threat in these challenges.

1056
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,189
Not to mention he's just always

1057
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,982
like in game mode.

1058
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,901
So, you know, unfortunately he

1059
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:08,069
just needs to go.

1060
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:11,030
>> Hey, I can guarantee you one

1061
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:11,322
thing, okay?

1062
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:15,076
It's one of us three.

1063
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,869
One of us three is going to be

1064
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,038
eating good tonight.

1065
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:19,580
>> I've got a 33% chance of

1066
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,249
being voted out tonight.

1067
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,166
I don't like going to Tribal

1068
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:22,750
Council just because someone's

1069
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:23,376
leaving.

1070
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,252
I really don't want to go

1071
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,754
tonight because it could be me.

1072
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,548
>> Can I just talk to you for a

1073
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:28,756
second?

1074
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,632
>> Yeah.

1075
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,634
Right here or you want to walk

1076
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:31,843
away?

1077
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:35,138
>> Can I still trust you?

1078
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,764
>> Yeah.

1079
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,808
>> Look me in the eyes?

1080
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:39,475
>> Yeah.

1081
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,102
>> Are you going to tell me when

1082
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:41,477
I'm going to go?

1083
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,438
>> Yeah. If I know I will.

1084
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,523
If I know, I'll definitely...

1085
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,400
all I know, the plan is... you

1086
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,235
know, Bobby Jon, our plan was

1087
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,278
you last anyway.

1088
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:50,486
>> Okay.

1089
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,405
Well, just keep me informed.

1090
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,865
All right?

1091
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:54,532
>> Yeah.

1092
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,284
>> Thanks.

1093
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:56,617
It is a game.

1094
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,619
When people talk to you, you

1095
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,204
don't know if they're lying or

1096
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,247
telling the truth.

1097
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:04,000
They're telling me that it's not

1098
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,543
me.

1099
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:06,294
They could all be lying to me, I

1100
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,212
don't know, so that tells me

1101
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,673
that I need that idol.

1102
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:11,299
I've got go find that idol right

1103
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:14,761
now.

1104
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,389
>> I want to talk to both of

1105
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:18,723
you.

1106
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,559
>> I know I'm out.

1107
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,070
>> I know that.

1108
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:33,654
>> That's all I was going to

1109
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,783
say.

1110
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,576
>> Okay.

1111
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:38,785
Cool.

1112
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,870
>> We need you, bud.

1113
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:43,456
>> I went and talked to Judd and

1114
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:44,040
Jamie.

1115
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,166
I told them I played with

1116
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:48,628
Stephenie before, great player,

1117
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,338
pretty, charming, athletic.

1118
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,174
She'll do what she's got to do.

1119
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,259
She'll lie to your face and give

1120
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,511
you that million-dollar grin.

1121
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,178
And she's going to get you guys,

1122
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,846
I'm telling you.

1123
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,264
They both looked at me and said,

1124
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,766
"You're not the one going home

1125
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:02,683
tonight."

1126
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,268
I said, "All right."

1127
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,213
>> I think it's pretty amazing

1128
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,757
that Judd told everybody the

1129
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,259
clue that it's on the ground,

1130
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:37,260
and I followed him back here and

1131
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,303
he's looking in the trees.

1132
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,180
That's pretty interesting.

1133
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,223
If it's on the ground, I wonder

1134
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,267
why he's looking in the trees.

1135
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,187
There's no doubt in my mind that

1136
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:48,521
Judd is lying.

1137
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,731
I won't be looking on the

1138
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,985
ground.

1139
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,403
>> Where did Gary go?

1140
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,196
To search for the idol.

1141
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,781
>> He went to find the idol.

1142
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,741
It would be amazing if he found

1143
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,368
it, amazing.

1144
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:06,831
Could you imagine?

1145
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,445
>> PROBST: So, Danni, this point

1146
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,280
in the game, how big a factor

1147
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,823
now does trust become?

1148
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,617
>> At this point, it gets kind

1149
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,368
of scary who you can trust and

1150
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,119
who you can't.

1151
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:46,287
And I'm worried because of the

1152
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,079
number game.

1153
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,497
And I don't think obviously I

1154
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,082
can trust anybody at this point.

1155
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,417
My head is on the chopping

1156
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:51,876
block.

1157
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:54,045
I hate that, but it's just part

1158
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,004
of the game.

1159
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:55,630
>> PROBST: Rafe, do you agree

1160
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,964
with that?

1161
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:57,506
>> Yeah, I think, you know,

1162
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,550
there's definitely a lot of

1163
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,052
paranoia around camp at this

1164
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:01,928
point in the game.

1165
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:02,511
You see two people go off and

1166
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,513
talk, and you're like, "What are

1167
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:05,306
they talking about?

1168
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,474
Are they talking about me?

1169
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,892
Are they going to vote me off?"

1170
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:08,476
I think that's kind of running

1171
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,352
through everyone's head.

1172
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,854
But at the same time, you have

1173
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,481
to kind of keep your focus and

1174
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,982
not let that drive you insane,

1175
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,442
because it can in this game.

1176
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:18,444
>> PROBST: Gary, can you lie in

1177
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:20,613
the game of Survivor and not be

1178
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,907
breaking any kind of moral code?

1179
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,575
>> Well, I think each individual

1180
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,243
looks at it differently, and

1181
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,745
there's no rule that says you

1182
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:29,080
can't lie in this game.

1183
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:29,622
It's just each individual

1184
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,874
looking at what they want to do

1185
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,417
and what they want to accomplish

1186
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:33,793
with this game.

1187
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:34,418
>> PROBST: Have you told any

1188
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,336
lies?

1189
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,755
>> No.

1190
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:38,881
>> PROBST: Judd, you lied in

1191
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:39,882
this game?

1192
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:43,219
>> No, sir, not yet.

1193
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,887
You know, it might happen, but

1194
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,013
as of this point in the game,

1195
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:46,514
no, I haven't lied about

1196
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,600
anything yet.

1197
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,935
>> PROBST: Cindy, you trust

1198
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:51,936
these people?

1199
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:52,478
>> Actually, I trust these

1200
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,730
people more than I expected.

1201
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,190
You spend time with them, you

1202
00:37:56,273 --> 00:37:57,441
get to know these people, and

1203
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,068
you can't help but develop some

1204
00:37:59,151 --> 00:37:59,652
sort of trust in them, but I

1205
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,904
don't think it's possible to go

1206
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,406
through this game from beginning

1207
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,074
to end and never lie to a single

1208
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,158
person about anything.

1209
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,576
So I think we're all going to be

1210
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,286
liars before it's all over with.

1211
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,663
>> PROBST: All right, before we

1212
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,206
get to the vote, a couple things

1213
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:12,623
to take care of.

1214
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:13,332
Jamie, you have the immunity

1215
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,001
necklace.

1216
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,669
If you wanted to give it up, you

1217
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:17,461
certainly can.

1218
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,171
>> I'm going to hang on to it.

1219
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:19,797
>> PROBST: Okay, the other order

1220
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,799
of business, if anybody has

1221
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:22,633
found the immunity idol and

1222
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,010
wants to use it tonight, now is

1223
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:28,264
the time to bring it up.

1224
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,442
>> Oh, my God!

1225
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:40,776
Gary.

1226
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,861
>> Man, good job, Gary.

1227
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:42,361
>> Damn.

1228
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,488
>> I knew it.

1229
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:47,616
>> Wow.

1230
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,659
>> PROBST: All right, no

1231
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,368
talking.

1232
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,037
Cannot vote for Jamie.

1233
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,579
You cannot vote for Gary.

1234
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,496
It is time to vote.

1235
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,666
Judd, you're up.

1236
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,388
>> Wow.

1237
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:12,433
I'm sorry.

1238
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:20,524
>> You just started to take

1239
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,567
control of the game, and I don't

1240
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,652
know how long it's going to

1241
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,404
last, but better now than never,

1242
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,740
I guess.

1243
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,545
>> I'm glad that you made the

1244
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:45,382
jury if you're the one that goes

1245
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,592
tonight, but I could be wrong.

1246
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:50,387
If it's not you, congrats.

1247
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,850
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1248
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,686
votes.

1249
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:06,654
Once the votes are read, the

1250
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,239
decision is final.

1251
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:08,823
The person voted out will be

1252
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,574
asked to leave the Tribal

1253
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,784
Council area immediately.

1254
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:15,162
I'll read the votes.

1255
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:20,167
First vote: Steph.

1256
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:20,751
Steph.

1257
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:24,505
Two votes Steph.

1258
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,466
Cindy.

1259
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,511
Two votes Steph, one vote Cindy.

1260
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,512
Bobby Jon.

1261
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,014
Two votes Steph.

1262
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:34,974
One vote Cindy.

1263
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,476
One vote Bobby Jon.

1264
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,186
Bobby Jon.

1265
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,729
That's two for Steph,

1266
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,691
two for Bobby Jon.

1267
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,192
Bobby Jon.

1268
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:49,655
That's three votes Bobby Jon.

1269
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:50,489
Bobby Jon.

1270
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:56,453
Four votes Bobby Jon.

1271
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,872
The tenth person voted out of

1272
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,081
<i>Survivor: Guatemala,</i>

1273
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,499
first member of our jury:

1274
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,584
Bobby Jon.

1275
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,753
Bring me your torch.

1276
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:12,720
Bobby Jon, the tribe has spoken.

1277
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,430
>> Thank you very much.

1278
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:14,847
I enjoyed it.

1279
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:15,264
>> PROBST: See you.

1280
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:15,681
>> Hang in there.

1281
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:19,768
Good luck.

1282
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:25,524
>> PROBST: Well, it's clear from

1283
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,484
tonight's Tribal Council that

1284
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:28,777
the next phase of this game is

1285
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,654
going to center around lying.

1286
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,282
The only problem is, you're

1287
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,658
lying to your jury.

1288
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,202
Should make for a fun finish.

1289
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,119
Grab your torches.

1290
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:37,786
Head back to camp.

1291
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,831
Good night.

Jamie gets irritated with Gary.

1297
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,308
>> You are calling me a liar.

1298
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:00,017
I don't like it.

1299
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,268
>> I did not just call you a

1300
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:01,435
liar.

1301
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:02,019

reward yet.

1305
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,983
>> And Lydia is put on the spot.

1306
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:08,609
>> I don't know what to say.

1307
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:09,985
You know?

1308
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,362

the outcome tonight.

1317
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,331
I had no clue that Gary was

1318
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:23,958
going to pull out an immunity

1319
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:24,625
