1
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,241
Bruce does a lot of
stupid, annoying stuff.

2
00:00:06,344 --> 00:00:07,620
Aah!

3
00:00:07,724 --> 00:00:08,724
He name-drops.

4
00:00:10,724 --> 00:00:13,551
It really does annoy me
deeply, like, to my core.

5
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:19,424
There's Bruce and
Jake on one side,

6
00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:20,862
Kendra and katurah on the other.

7
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:22,896
Me and Brando are in the middle.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,689
I found a beware advantage,
and I have to find an x.

9
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,724
But right now I have no vote.

10
00:00:30,482 --> 00:00:33,310
Myself, Julie, Austin and Dee...

11
00:00:33,413 --> 00:00:34,733
This is gonna be
the solid group.

12
00:00:40,655 --> 00:00:42,310
I don't have a vote now.

13
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,517
Okay.

14
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,793
People are hating on her,

15
00:00:45,896 --> 00:00:48,689
but maybe I can nurse
her back to health.

16
00:00:48,793 --> 00:00:50,273
One of the things
that I can do is...

17
00:00:51,344 --> 00:00:52,724
So you guys have my trust.

18
00:00:52,827 --> 00:00:54,482
Thank you.

19
00:00:54,586 --> 00:00:57,172
I'm learning from my
mistakes, learning to tone down

20
00:00:57,275 --> 00:01:00,586
the more harsh qualities
and rebuilding trust.

21
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:02,931
Brandon. That's
two. That's enough.

22
00:01:04,516 --> 00:01:05,516
The tribe has spoken.

23
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:16,689
My gosh.

24
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:20,241
I will say, I never
second-guessed my decision,

25
00:01:20,344 --> 00:01:22,009
but, you know, obviously,
Brandon was gonna

26
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:23,551
make it really
hard on all of us?

27
00:01:23,655 --> 00:01:26,068
I can't imagine how tough
that was... decision was.

28
00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:27,655
So thank you, guys.

29
00:01:27,758 --> 00:01:29,482
In the marines, we
have a concept...

30
00:01:29,586 --> 00:01:31,068
"No man left behind."

31
00:01:31,172 --> 00:01:34,000
But I'm starting to realize
that doesn't apply here.

32
00:01:34,103 --> 00:01:36,689
This team could
not win with Brandon.

33
00:01:36,793 --> 00:01:38,424
I know that could have
gone either way, and I

34
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:39,931
I don't have words to express

35
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,344
- how appreciative that I'm still here.
- Yeah.

36
00:01:42,448 --> 00:01:45,344
I like Emily, for
what it's worth.

37
00:01:45,448 --> 00:01:47,389
Yeah, we bump heads 'cause
we're from two different places,

38
00:01:47,413 --> 00:01:48,931
and we process things different.

39
00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:50,862
But I don't dislike Emily,

40
00:01:50,965 --> 00:01:54,758
so I don't feel like keeping
Emily's shot in the dark

41
00:01:54,862 --> 00:01:55,965
would serve me at all.

42
00:02:01,241 --> 00:02:05,103
If Emily continues to
prove herself worthy of trust,

43
00:02:05,206 --> 00:02:07,206
we can go forward as a four.

44
00:02:12,413 --> 00:02:14,310
I'm shocked that sabiyah gave me

45
00:02:14,413 --> 00:02:16,241
my shot in the dark back,

46
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,079
because they have to
know that if we lose the next

47
00:02:18,103 --> 00:02:20,286
immunity challenge, that unless
something crazy is happening,

48
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,482
I'm playing that
shot in the dark.

49
00:02:22,586 --> 00:02:24,758
There is a growth
that's happening here

50
00:02:24,862 --> 00:02:26,700
between all of us that
I feel like that's there.

51
00:02:26,724 --> 00:02:28,700
If that wasn't there, then we
may have stuck with Brandon.

52
00:02:28,724 --> 00:02:30,172
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

53
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,838
But because there's, like,
this belief of the potential

54
00:02:31,862 --> 00:02:34,413
of us four working together,
that's why it just made sense.

55
00:02:34,517 --> 00:02:38,896
Tribal council went
relatively well, but

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,275
I was really confused
because Jeff read my vote

57
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:44,034
I had voted for
Brandon... a second vote,

58
00:02:44,137 --> 00:02:45,562
and then said, "Brandon,
you're voted out."

59
00:02:45,586 --> 00:02:47,034
And according to my math,

60
00:02:47,137 --> 00:02:49,689
knowing that Brandon
did not have a vote,

61
00:02:49,793 --> 00:02:52,551
there should have
been four total votes.

62
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:55,000
So that made me think that
maybe there weren't four votes.

63
00:02:55,103 --> 00:02:56,586
Maybe there were
only three votes.

64
00:02:58,724 --> 00:03:01,172
- What do you mean?
- 'Cause I'm confused.

65
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:04,413
Jeff read two votes
and then said.

66
00:03:05,413 --> 00:03:07,213
"Brandon, you're evicted
on the second vote."

67
00:03:07,275 --> 00:03:09,395
Which means there's only
three votes in there, right?

68
00:03:10,896 --> 00:03:13,655
So why did he call it
after only two votes?

69
00:03:16,172 --> 00:03:17,448
Emily is right.

70
00:03:17,551 --> 00:03:20,034
I couldn't vote because
of the beware advantage.

71
00:03:20,137 --> 00:03:21,655
She's very smart.

72
00:03:21,758 --> 00:03:24,586
So Emily will always
be on my radar.

73
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:25,896
He only read two.

74
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:28,355
He said, like, "second
person voted out."

75
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,206
I was like, "what?"

76
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,000
This is like the island of
misfit toys that I'm living on.

77
00:03:33,103 --> 00:03:34,965
Emily cracked
again tonight. Probst

78
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:37,862
was reading out the votes, and
there was only two that he read.

79
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:40,172
And she was like, "sabiyah",

80
00:03:40,275 --> 00:03:43,172
"do you not have a vote
tonight?" Just immediately

81
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:45,103
picking a fight
with the one person

82
00:03:45,206 --> 00:03:47,000
she's not supposed
to pick a fight with.

83
00:03:47,103 --> 00:03:50,137
Old Emily is just bubbling right
there underneath the surface.

84
00:03:50,241 --> 00:03:53,137
Like, she's not gone, right?
But she is getting better

85
00:03:53,241 --> 00:03:56,379
and smarter, and Emily
is somebody who I think

86
00:03:56,482 --> 00:03:59,379
knows that she has a home
with me, and I'm gonna be

87
00:03:59,482 --> 00:04:02,068
the most real with her out
of anybody on this island.

88
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:27,517
You good?

89
00:05:29,482 --> 00:05:30,551
Are you okay?

90
00:05:31,827 --> 00:05:33,310
Well, then what just happened?

91
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:35,793
Jake kind of takes a tumble,

92
00:05:35,896 --> 00:05:38,241
and it looks like a...
Almost small seizure.

93
00:05:38,344 --> 00:05:41,827
He kind of, like, gets
shaky for a minute.

94
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:43,103
It was kind of weird.

95
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:44,896
And then he
popped right out of it.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,413
So it was really, really scary.

97
00:05:47,517 --> 00:05:49,137
It's the smoke, man.

98
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:50,862
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm good.

99
00:05:50,965 --> 00:05:52,113
- I feel perfectly fine, yeah.
- Sit down for a second.

100
00:05:52,137 --> 00:05:54,965
- Okay. My god.
- I was

101
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:57,137
trying to blow on the
embers to get the fire

102
00:05:57,241 --> 00:06:00,724
restarted, and I
started seeing stars.

103
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,517
I felt like my whole hand
shaking and everything.

104
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,060
Like, my body was,
like, convulsing.

105
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:06,620
I-I-I may have fell over.

106
00:06:06,724 --> 00:06:08,931
I don't... I don't really know.

107
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:10,862
- You kind of had a spasm.
- Yeah.

108
00:06:10,965 --> 00:06:12,965
So that was a
really scary moment.

109
00:06:13,068 --> 00:06:14,551
People can't
understand from home.

110
00:06:14,655 --> 00:06:16,975
There's constant heat, constant
dehydration, lack of food.

111
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:18,724
It's gonna take a
toll on your body.

112
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:24,389
We're on survivor,
man. Dude, I, like...

113
00:06:24,413 --> 00:06:25,907
You got to just... It's,
like, random moments.

114
00:06:25,931 --> 00:06:27,034
You're just, like...

115
00:06:29,586 --> 00:06:31,217
Like, that's what makes
me scared, because, like,

116
00:06:31,241 --> 00:06:32,841
emotionally, like,
obviously, I'm, like,

117
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:34,700
I'm not gonna play an
emotional game, but, like,

118
00:06:34,724 --> 00:06:36,689
I... love everyone here.

119
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:43,482
- I think, um...
- I know you guys are boys, but, um

120
00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:44,758
I'm boys with everyone.

121
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,551
- I feel like I'm boys with you.
- Yeah.

122
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:48,379
Have you heard my name?

123
00:06:48,482 --> 00:06:50,162
The only time your
name has been mentioned

124
00:06:50,206 --> 00:06:52,320
was in the beginning when
we found out you were a lawyer.

125
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:54,137
Jake having that
moment this morning

126
00:06:54,241 --> 00:06:55,827
made me feel
protective over him.

127
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:59,172
We chatted for a bit, and
I said, "you know what?"

128
00:06:59,275 --> 00:07:00,551
"Actually, in the beginning,

129
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:02,413
"I kind of threw
your name out there,

130
00:07:02,517 --> 00:07:03,931
because you're a lawyer."

131
00:07:04,034 --> 00:07:05,389
And lawyers are
threatening in this game.

132
00:07:05,413 --> 00:07:07,068
They know how to talk to people,

133
00:07:07,172 --> 00:07:08,631
and, you know,
they're trained in that.

134
00:07:08,655 --> 00:07:10,034
I'm not trained in anything.

135
00:07:10,137 --> 00:07:12,241
I am a wild creature out here.

136
00:07:12,344 --> 00:07:13,827
My biggest thing is, like,

137
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:15,689
I'm coming here
with an open mind.

138
00:07:15,793 --> 00:07:17,217
- Okay.
- Like, we haven't talked strategy.

139
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:18,907
- This is our first time talking.
- No, we haven't...

140
00:07:18,931 --> 00:07:20,872
Which made me nervous.
Like, you know what I mean?

141
00:07:20,896 --> 00:07:22,596
Like, Bruce hasn't
talked to me at all, like

142
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,517
I apologize for
that, because, like,

143
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,985
communication, you know,
two-way street, because, like...

144
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:26,527
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

145
00:07:26,551 --> 00:07:28,907
- It's on both of us... yeah.
- So that's why I'm being honest with you.

146
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:30,517
There's kind of two
groups right now...

147
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,586
The three women and the boys.

148
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:35,000
I feel good with you.

149
00:07:35,103 --> 00:07:36,803
We're definitely,
like, drinking after this.

150
00:07:36,827 --> 00:07:39,793
However, I am changing
my tune about Jake.

151
00:07:39,896 --> 00:07:41,424
I feel like we would
work so well together.

152
00:07:41,448 --> 00:07:42,724
We communicate well.

153
00:07:42,827 --> 00:07:44,344
He's easygoing.

154
00:07:44,448 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm me.

155
00:07:46,103 --> 00:07:47,562
I feel like we'd
balance each other out

156
00:07:47,586 --> 00:07:49,586
- really well, actually.
- Let's go, baby.

157
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:52,793
And so, Jake
could be a good ally.

158
00:07:57,931 --> 00:08:00,482
I think, in the
total of six days,

159
00:08:00,586 --> 00:08:02,758
we've had, like, 300 calories.

160
00:08:02,862 --> 00:08:05,068
I found two
earthworms for us to eat.

161
00:08:07,034 --> 00:08:08,931
Y'all, there's no worms in here.

162
00:08:09,034 --> 00:08:10,758
What?

163
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:12,769
- Is there a crab in there?
- Yes, and he's very active.

164
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:14,655
Crab ate our breakfast.

165
00:08:14,758 --> 00:08:17,827
No way. There's no way.

166
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,689
Damn.

167
00:08:19,793 --> 00:08:23,275
Even though I am
starving, all I can think about

168
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:25,206
is finding the
hidden immunity idol.

169
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,620
But I haven't had time
to get out of camp alone.

170
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:31,000
The last clue said,

171
00:08:31,103 --> 00:08:33,861
"dig at the fallen palm tree x."

172
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:35,482
So now I'm like, "all right,

173
00:08:35,586 --> 00:08:38,172
where is this fallen palm
tree, and what is this x?"

174
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,275
So, at this point,
only drew knows.

175
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:45,482
And we have a good idea
of where this location is.

176
00:08:45,586 --> 00:08:47,620
There's, like, this
obviously fallen palm tree

177
00:08:47,724 --> 00:08:49,275
that's right by camp

178
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:51,862
with two palm trees
next to it forming an "x."

179
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:54,448
So I'm thinking to
myself, "this has to be it."

180
00:08:56,482 --> 00:08:59,344
So now we need to
find this frigging idol

181
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:00,793
and get my vote back.

182
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:09,793
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

183
00:09:09,896 --> 00:09:11,527
Okay, I'm gonna go
up here a little bit, then.

184
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,000
- I'm gonna go a ways out, and I'll stop.
- Cool.

185
00:09:19,896 --> 00:09:23,344
Finding the idol in that
spot, so close to camp,

186
00:09:23,448 --> 00:09:25,000
requires some killer instinct.

187
00:09:25,103 --> 00:09:27,034
It requires entrepreneurship.

188
00:09:27,137 --> 00:09:29,517
That's nasty.

189
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,034
So Austin digs first,
and I'm on lookout.

190
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:33,586
And so I'm pacing
down the trails,

191
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:36,010
and I'm waiting to see somebody,
so I can start yelling about

192
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,689
how much I love
tacos or whatnot.

193
00:09:37,793 --> 00:09:38,965
And he'll-he'll run out, too.

194
00:09:39,068 --> 00:09:40,758
And he'll be like,
"I also love tacos."

195
00:09:40,862 --> 00:09:42,389
And, you know, there
would be our alibi.

196
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:44,137
But I'm very nervous.

197
00:09:44,241 --> 00:09:47,689
So, I was thinking last
night about Austin and drew.

198
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:51,000
Do you not feel the vibe?

199
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,310
- You think?
- Yeah.

200
00:09:52,413 --> 00:09:54,413
I've noticed that him and Austin

201
00:09:54,517 --> 00:09:57,137
have been having a lot of
one-on-one time together.

202
00:09:57,241 --> 00:09:58,941
And then every time
we're walking a tree mail,

203
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:01,241
walking back, they
whisper to each other.

204
00:10:01,344 --> 00:10:04,482
So right now, I have a great
alliance with mama Julie.

205
00:10:04,586 --> 00:10:08,103
And then mama Julie,
Austin, drew and I,

206
00:10:08,206 --> 00:10:10,000
we got, like, a
four thing going on.

207
00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:14,217
But there's certain
things that I've noticed

208
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:16,344
about drew and Austin
which makes me think

209
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:18,413
that something's going on there.

210
00:10:19,655 --> 00:10:20,689
Yep.

211
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:35,586
So, in the peripheral
of my vision, I see drew

212
00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:37,103
digging and digging,

213
00:10:37,206 --> 00:10:39,406
but drew doesn't see us
because his back is towards us.

214
00:10:39,482 --> 00:10:42,068
So then we decide
to just keep walking

215
00:10:42,172 --> 00:10:44,000
and see how he reacts.

216
00:10:46,827 --> 00:10:50,793
And as we get closer, he
gets up, and he walks away,

217
00:10:50,896 --> 00:10:52,862
'cause I'm sure he
was, like, so nervous.

218
00:10:55,034 --> 00:10:57,448
It was an odd moment, right?

219
00:10:57,551 --> 00:10:59,286
I'm digging in the dirt.
And they say, "what's up?"

220
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,896
And I walk the wrong way,
you know? So that was bad.

221
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,148
So I need to kind of
do some damage repair

222
00:11:03,172 --> 00:11:04,586
and regain control.

223
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:07,379
If you catch me with my
pants down, I got to give you...

224
00:11:07,482 --> 00:11:09,724
Give you something,
to make up for it.

225
00:11:09,827 --> 00:11:12,103
Okay. So we're digging.

226
00:11:12,206 --> 00:11:14,310
- Yeah.
- Digging? For what?

227
00:11:14,413 --> 00:11:16,555
We think there might
be something over here.

228
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:16,862
Why?

229
00:11:16,965 --> 00:11:20,241
We sifu digging, but
then he-he, gave up.

230
00:11:20,344 --> 00:11:22,172
- Wow.
- Did he know... Did he catch you guys?

231
00:11:22,275 --> 00:11:23,724
No.

232
00:11:24,724 --> 00:11:25,793
Here comes Austin.

233
00:11:25,896 --> 00:11:27,172
I was on watch,

234
00:11:27,275 --> 00:11:28,631
and I'm, you know,
grabbing coconuts

235
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,413
to make it look like
we're, like, you know,

236
00:11:30,517 --> 00:11:31,620
doing stuff for the tribe,

237
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,586
and next thing I
know, I come back,

238
00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:36,758
and Dee and mama j. Are there.

239
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,689
And my heart just drops.

240
00:11:38,793 --> 00:11:39,827
So...

241
00:11:43,931 --> 00:11:45,827
So I'm feeling real awkward.

242
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:48,034
I'm like, "gosh. What
is about to happen?"

243
00:11:48,137 --> 00:11:49,631
We just wanted to,
like, find you guys,

244
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:51,793
'cause we have noticed
that you guys have been, like,

245
00:11:51,896 --> 00:11:54,310
taking walks, and we just
wanted to, like, be honest.

246
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:55,193
Thanks for... yeah.

247
00:11:55,217 --> 00:11:57,286
And we just want to, like,
come together, and, like,

248
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,251
whether you have something
or not, like, we respect it,

249
00:11:59,275 --> 00:12:01,931
but we want to make
sure that we're four strong.

250
00:12:02,034 --> 00:12:03,827
Yeah. No, we are four strong.

251
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,665
- We do not, like...
- Four strong. Four strong.

252
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:08,413
We're trying to find the
idol. We don't have any...

253
00:12:08,517 --> 00:12:10,267
We're trying to get
to it before sifu does.

254
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:10,803
Okay. Okay.

255
00:12:10,827 --> 00:12:13,793
Right now I'm just trusting
my intuition, and my intuition

256
00:12:13,896 --> 00:12:17,103
tells me that something was
off between the two of them.

257
00:12:17,206 --> 00:12:19,469
This is the four that
can take us all the way.

258
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:19,827
Yeah.

259
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:21,862
Drew is just uneasy
and there's, like,

260
00:12:21,965 --> 00:12:24,148
a worried face in Austin's
face, like, something's going on.

261
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:26,137
If we're really four
strong, and we caught him,

262
00:12:26,241 --> 00:12:28,000
why would he walk
away all nervous?

263
00:12:28,103 --> 00:12:30,758
- Okay. You're right.
- I mean, there's no...

264
00:12:30,862 --> 00:12:32,689
Mind you, this is a
game of dishonesty,

265
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,758
but I thought we
were working together.

266
00:12:34,862 --> 00:12:36,734
It kind of felt like a
boyfriend was cheating on me

267
00:12:36,758 --> 00:12:40,000
and I caught him
cheating, so it's game on.

268
00:12:57,827 --> 00:12:59,206
Come on in!

269
00:13:17,758 --> 00:13:20,448
Belo and reba
getting your first look

270
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:21,896
at the new Lulu tribe.

271
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,620
Brandon voted out at
the last tribal council.

272
00:13:25,724 --> 00:13:26,758
Wow.

273
00:13:32,689 --> 00:13:36,000
All right, are you ready to get
to today's reward challenge?

274
00:13:36,103 --> 00:13:37,931
- Yes!
- Hell yeah. Let's go.

275
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:39,655
Please.

276
00:13:39,758 --> 00:13:41,551
For today's challenge,
you're gonna start

277
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,931
in the ocean and
race to the beach,

278
00:13:44,034 --> 00:13:45,551
where one at a time,

279
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:48,758
each player will toss a
ball into an overhead track

280
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:51,413
and then try to catch
it at the other end.

281
00:13:51,517 --> 00:13:53,620
Once all four players
have achieved this,

282
00:13:53,724 --> 00:13:56,000
they'll take one of those
balls, throw it in a basket,

283
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:58,655
that will raise a
series of targets.

284
00:13:58,758 --> 00:14:00,689
Two players will
then race to land

285
00:14:00,793 --> 00:14:02,655
three rings on their target.

286
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:07,862
First two tribes to land
all three rings win reward.

287
00:14:07,965 --> 00:14:09,631
- Want to know what you're playing for?
- Yeah, Jeff.

288
00:14:09,655 --> 00:14:10,793
- Yes.
- Of course.

289
00:14:10,896 --> 00:14:12,182
- Been dreaming of it.
- Come on, now,

290
00:14:12,206 --> 00:14:13,631
- bring the food.
- First tribe to finish

291
00:14:13,655 --> 00:14:15,862
should have a nice
afternoon back at camp.

292
00:14:15,965 --> 00:14:17,586
My god!

293
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:19,689
- Ooh.
- Called it.

294
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:21,482
A large fruit platter.

295
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:23,206
My god.

296
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,068
Man.

297
00:14:25,172 --> 00:14:29,206
Second tribe to finish,
smaller, but still appetizing.

298
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,172
- Look at those bananas.
- That's a feast.

299
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:33,931
Thank you, Jeff!

300
00:14:34,034 --> 00:14:37,275
In addition, the winning tribe

301
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:39,413
earns the right to
send one person

302
00:14:39,517 --> 00:14:41,896
to either of the
two other tribes

303
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,694
for a camp raid, where
you will get to steal one item.

304
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,448
Let's go.

305
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:49,862
In a game in which
there is very little to steal,

306
00:14:49,965 --> 00:14:51,724
you can inflict some punishment.

307
00:14:51,827 --> 00:14:54,275
You can also visit and
see the tribe dynamic.

308
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:56,310
So there is a lot at stake.

309
00:14:58,206 --> 00:15:00,217
All right, sit-outs. Belo,
you have two extra people.

310
00:15:00,241 --> 00:15:02,517
Who are you gonna sit out?

311
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,079
Bruce and Jake
gonna sit this one out.

312
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,103
All right, reba, same thing.

313
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:07,552
You're sitting out two
people. Who's it gonna be?

314
00:15:07,576 --> 00:15:08,355
Yeah, yeah. Got it. Yeah...

315
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:09,793
It'll be me, Jeff.

316
00:15:09,896 --> 00:15:11,827
- And me.
- J. And drew gonna sit this out.

317
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:13,286
Sit-outs, take a
spot on the bench.

318
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,803
Everybody else, give
you a minute to strategize.

319
00:15:14,827 --> 00:15:16,896
We'll get it on. Let's do it.

320
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:21,586
All right, here we go.

321
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:24,172
For reward. Survivors ready?

322
00:15:25,827 --> 00:15:27,586
Go!

323
00:15:27,689 --> 00:15:29,310
Everybody in the water at once.

324
00:15:29,413 --> 00:15:30,586
Let's go!

325
00:15:31,586 --> 00:15:35,724
We have had some close
finishes between first and second,

326
00:15:35,827 --> 00:15:39,448
so every single second matters.

327
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:40,724
Belo, baby.

328
00:15:40,827 --> 00:15:42,655
You got to get everybody back

329
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:45,000
before you can
start tossing the ball.

330
00:15:45,103 --> 00:15:47,206
Here we go. Let's go, belo.

331
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,620
Nice job, belo.

332
00:15:48,724 --> 00:15:50,389
- Go, go, go, go...
- Here we go, here we go

333
00:15:50,413 --> 00:15:51,827
Lulu, you're good.

334
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:55,068
Belo's good. Reba, you're good.

335
00:15:56,103 --> 00:15:57,965
- You got this, sifu.
- Let's go.

336
00:15:58,068 --> 00:16:00,103
You got to get that ball
to roll down the track.

337
00:16:00,206 --> 00:16:02,551
That's the first task.

338
00:16:02,655 --> 00:16:03,965
There goes Kaleb.

339
00:16:04,068 --> 00:16:07,931
He is moving quickly
and makes it look easy.

340
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:09,034
Go, Sean.

341
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:11,517
You got this, kid.

342
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,413
Good job. Nice job. Nice job.

343
00:16:13,517 --> 00:16:14,586
There you go.

344
00:16:14,689 --> 00:16:16,000
Sean has a good roll.

345
00:16:16,103 --> 00:16:18,000
Kendra with a good roll.

346
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:19,448
Kendra's got it! Sean's got it!

347
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:22,482
They're both good!

348
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:25,965
Sabiyah now for Lulu.

349
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,862
Brando for belo.

350
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:32,068
There goes Austin,
making it look easy.

351
00:16:32,172 --> 00:16:34,172
Reba's on the board. Go, reba!

352
00:16:35,931 --> 00:16:38,206
Sabiyah's got it. Go, Lulu!

353
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,068
Brando's good.

354
00:16:40,172 --> 00:16:41,206
Go, katurah!

355
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,379
Emily is the last
member for Lulu.

356
00:16:44,482 --> 00:16:45,724
Go, go, go, go!

357
00:16:45,827 --> 00:16:47,724
Emily takes a big hit.

358
00:16:47,827 --> 00:16:49,137
Can't get there.

359
00:16:51,241 --> 00:16:52,724
Come on, come on, come on.

360
00:16:52,827 --> 00:16:55,482
Come on, come on... Sifu's good.

361
00:16:55,586 --> 00:16:57,000
That's two for reba.

362
00:16:57,103 --> 00:16:58,310
Go, Dee!

363
00:16:58,413 --> 00:17:00,344
Go. You're almost...

364
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:04,310
Katurah drops.
She's got to go again.

365
00:17:07,448 --> 00:17:08,792
Go, go, go.

366
00:17:08,896 --> 00:17:11,103
Dee with her first toss.

367
00:17:11,205 --> 00:17:12,241
Come on, Dee!

368
00:17:12,344 --> 00:17:14,034
And she is ripping it up.

369
00:17:14,137 --> 00:17:15,655
- Yes! Yes!
- You're good!

370
00:17:15,758 --> 00:17:16,896
Go, Julie!

371
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,655
It is now Lulu with
one person left

372
00:17:19,758 --> 00:17:21,862
and reba with one person left.

373
00:17:21,964 --> 00:17:24,000
You got it, turn!

374
00:17:25,723 --> 00:17:27,241
- Yeah, kel! Yeah!
- Nice!

375
00:17:27,344 --> 00:17:29,655
Belo. Belo with one person left.

376
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:30,896
Down.

377
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:33,482
Yes.

378
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:34,655
Emily's got it.

379
00:17:34,758 --> 00:17:35,931
Lulu, you're good.

380
00:17:36,034 --> 00:17:38,965
First, you got to
get your target up.

381
00:17:40,103 --> 00:17:43,517
Kaleb with his
first shot. Hits it.

382
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,344
Go, Lulu!

383
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:47,620
Go, go, run.

384
00:17:47,724 --> 00:17:49,344
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

385
00:17:49,448 --> 00:17:50,689
You're good, belo.

386
00:17:50,793 --> 00:17:52,551
Right in there, baby.

387
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,793
Belo now tossing.

388
00:17:54,896 --> 00:17:57,448
Julie's got to land this.

389
00:17:59,275 --> 00:18:01,000
- She's got it!
- Everyone, everyone!

390
00:18:01,103 --> 00:18:02,655
You're good, reba.

391
00:18:02,758 --> 00:18:04,758
Everybody in it now.

392
00:18:05,758 --> 00:18:07,551
Kaleb lands the first ring.

393
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:09,586
Lulu is in the lead

394
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,275
for the first time
in the challenge.

395
00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:12,448
Here we go, Kendra.

396
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:13,931
Here goes Kendra.

397
00:18:14,034 --> 00:18:16,586
She's got to raise that
target first, and she does.

398
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:17,689
Yeah!

399
00:18:17,724 --> 00:18:19,137
Here goes Austin.

400
00:18:19,241 --> 00:18:21,793
Trying to get his target
raised, and he does.

401
00:18:21,896 --> 00:18:24,000
Everybody is now firing rings.

402
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,551
It is Lulu.

403
00:18:25,655 --> 00:18:27,379
They are win less this season.

404
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,724
It would be a huge victory.

405
00:18:29,827 --> 00:18:31,068
- Yeah!
- Yes!

406
00:18:31,172 --> 00:18:32,275
Kaleb sticks a second ring.

407
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,241
Lulu could win it right here.

408
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:41,275
- And they have it...
- A new tribe and a real result.

409
00:18:41,379 --> 00:18:44,827
Lulu has broken
their record of losses

410
00:18:44,931 --> 00:18:47,103
with a massive win.

411
00:18:49,482 --> 00:18:51,517
Big fruit plate and a camp raid.

412
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,000
Who will get the
other fruit plate?

413
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,379
Austin sticks one for reba.

414
00:18:57,482 --> 00:18:58,655
Yes!

415
00:18:58,758 --> 00:18:59,931
Can Kendra match right here?

416
00:19:00,034 --> 00:19:01,689
Here we go, Kendra.

417
00:19:01,793 --> 00:19:05,137
No. You are on it,
Kendra. Right there.

418
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:08,413
- Austin with a second ring.
- He's got the hang of it now.

419
00:19:08,517 --> 00:19:10,206
Belo with none.

420
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,172
Come on, guys. All right.
Come on. Here we go.

421
00:19:12,275 --> 00:19:14,931
Brando sticks it for belo.

422
00:19:15,034 --> 00:19:17,482
Austin can win it right here.

423
00:19:17,586 --> 00:19:18,724
Yep.

424
00:19:18,827 --> 00:19:23,655
There it is! Reba wins
the second fruit platter,

425
00:19:23,758 --> 00:19:27,758
sending belo back
home empty-handed.

426
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,896
All right. Lulu.

427
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,655
When you're losing,

428
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,206
there is nothing
worse on survivor,

429
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,931
but when you're winning,

430
00:19:40,034 --> 00:19:42,206
is there a better
feeling, sabiyah?

431
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:45,482
There's nothing that
feels better than that, Jeff.

432
00:19:45,586 --> 00:19:47,275
I mean, I know
everybody's hungry,

433
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:49,758
everybody wants to be
here, but we are literally

434
00:19:49,862 --> 00:19:51,413
starving in the jungle.

435
00:19:51,517 --> 00:19:52,758
So if that's not motivation

436
00:19:52,862 --> 00:19:54,700
for you to get after
it, I don't know what is.

437
00:19:54,724 --> 00:19:56,000
All right, Lulu,

438
00:19:56,103 --> 00:19:57,769
big fruit platter waiting
for you back at camp.

439
00:19:57,793 --> 00:20:00,448
In addition, you're gonna
have a big decision to make.

440
00:20:00,551 --> 00:20:03,068
Who are you sending? Which
camp are you gonna raid?

441
00:20:03,172 --> 00:20:05,206
Reba, waiting for
you back at camp,

442
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,793
smaller, but still
something in that belly.

443
00:20:07,896 --> 00:20:09,620
And you have to
anticipate whether or not

444
00:20:09,724 --> 00:20:11,034
you're gonna have a camp raid.

445
00:20:11,137 --> 00:20:12,413
Belo, got nothing for you.

446
00:20:12,517 --> 00:20:14,758
Grab your stuff,
head back to camp,

447
00:20:14,862 --> 00:20:18,241
and ponder what you're gonna
do if they decide to raid you.

448
00:20:19,241 --> 00:20:20,793
All right, reba,
enjoy the afternoon.

449
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:29,379
So, Lulu, now you get
to make a big decision.

450
00:20:30,413 --> 00:20:32,068
Which camp do you want to raid

451
00:20:32,172 --> 00:20:34,344
and who are you going to
send as your ambassador?

452
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:37,153
I'd like to go, if you
guys are cool with it.

453
00:20:37,177 --> 00:20:37,424
Yeah.

454
00:20:37,448 --> 00:20:39,172
- I'm down.
- Yeah, I'm cool.

455
00:20:39,275 --> 00:20:40,915
- It's Kaleb?
- Yeah, it's gonna be Kaleb.

456
00:20:40,965 --> 00:20:42,310
Why Kaleb?

457
00:20:42,413 --> 00:20:44,206
It's no surprise, Kaleb
is probably the most

458
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,896
social player
amongst the four of us.

459
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,241
He's probably the one
person we can all agree on

460
00:20:48,344 --> 00:20:49,624
is perfect for this type of job.

461
00:20:49,689 --> 00:20:52,206
Now the bigger question:

462
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:55,137
Which tribe are you gonna raid?

463
00:21:05,862 --> 00:21:07,344
We won the challenge

464
00:21:07,448 --> 00:21:09,724
and my tribe chose me
to go to the camp raid.

465
00:21:09,827 --> 00:21:12,344
So here I am, geared
up, going to the boat.

466
00:21:12,448 --> 00:21:15,241
And what do I see? On
the boat is a little script.

467
00:21:37,241 --> 00:21:39,103
The goodwill advantage
means that if somebody

468
00:21:39,206 --> 00:21:41,241
loses their vote, they
get to retain their vote.

469
00:21:41,344 --> 00:21:42,827
They get to
cancel out that loss.

470
00:21:42,931 --> 00:21:46,620
So, not only am I coming to
the tribe and trying make a friend,

471
00:21:46,724 --> 00:21:48,724
but I have a gift to
be able to give 'em.

472
00:21:48,827 --> 00:21:50,137
Who doesn't love gifts?

473
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:58,275
- Potassium, right here.
- My god, you guys.

474
00:21:58,379 --> 00:22:00,103
- This is so incredible.
- I'm gonna cry.

475
00:22:00,206 --> 00:22:02,006
I think I would have
paid hundreds of dollars

476
00:22:02,034 --> 00:22:04,034
for this specific banana.

477
00:22:08,517 --> 00:22:10,517
I know.

478
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,896
Lulu gets to send one
person from their tribe

479
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,586
to either our
tribe or belo's tribe

480
00:22:17,689 --> 00:22:19,275
and raid the camp.

481
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,413
Lulu could go to
reba and weaken them

482
00:22:22,517 --> 00:22:24,113
or they could come over
here and try to make bonds.

483
00:22:24,137 --> 00:22:25,976
What are they gonna do,
come here and take our spear,

484
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,440
when they could
take the other ones?

485
00:22:27,482 --> 00:22:28,838
- Like, that's not really gonna weaken us.
- Exactly.

486
00:22:28,862 --> 00:22:32,068
If Lulu comes over
here, I will lose my...

487
00:22:38,965 --> 00:22:41,000
There's no way
that's the boat already.

488
00:22:41,103 --> 00:22:42,310
My god. They're here.

489
00:22:42,413 --> 00:22:43,665
- Who is it? Who is it?
- Who is it?

490
00:22:43,689 --> 00:22:45,344
Is that Kaleb?

491
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,034
- Kaleb.
- Yeah, it's Kaleb.

492
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,000
Hey! How's it going, Kaleb?

493
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:51,079
Kaleb. Nice to meet you.

494
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,872
I knew it would be
Kaleb, because I can tell

495
00:22:52,896 --> 00:22:55,724
Kaleb is running that
tribe, front to back.

496
00:22:55,827 --> 00:22:56,931
I'm a hugger, by the way.

497
00:22:57,034 --> 00:22:58,517
That guy is charismatic.

498
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,482
He is persuasive.
He is a salesman.

499
00:23:00,586 --> 00:23:01,965
- Where are you from?
- Canada.

500
00:23:02,068 --> 00:23:06,034
I'm a city guy, so I
mean... So I knew he would

501
00:23:06,137 --> 00:23:08,017
be the person they send
to kind of schmooze us,

502
00:23:08,068 --> 00:23:09,862
sell us some "whatever he sells"

503
00:23:09,965 --> 00:23:11,862
and, take all of our
stuff in the process.

504
00:23:11,965 --> 00:23:14,068
What do you guys
all do for work?

505
00:23:14,172 --> 00:23:16,620
Travel and compose
my own music. I love it.

506
00:23:16,724 --> 00:23:18,148
- Right on. That's awesome.
- Yeah. Yeah.

507
00:23:18,172 --> 00:23:19,896
I'm a professional
singer-songwriter.

508
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,448
Interesting.

509
00:23:21,551 --> 00:23:23,079
Have you guys just been
harmonizing this entire time?

510
00:23:23,103 --> 00:23:26,655
- Yes, we've been...
- Should we do that? - Sure.

511
00:23:26,758 --> 00:23:28,438
- I love "four steps down."
- Take it away.

512
00:23:39,103 --> 00:23:41,241
- Ooh.
- Ooh. A nice riff there.

513
00:23:41,344 --> 00:23:43,344
- Yeah.
- That's the beginning, yeah.

514
00:23:43,448 --> 00:23:44,586
Hey. You guys.

515
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,448
Well, this is fun.

516
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:49,103
In sales, when everyone's
having a good time,

517
00:23:49,206 --> 00:23:51,182
they tend to let their
guard down a little bit more,

518
00:23:51,206 --> 00:23:53,355
which gives you more
opportunity to be able to capitalize.

519
00:23:53,379 --> 00:23:54,862
So what brings you here?

520
00:23:54,965 --> 00:23:56,896
- It's a raid.
- We thought it just made sense

521
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,734
to grab the fishing
gear. Is that all right?

522
00:23:58,758 --> 00:24:00,638
What fishing stuff were
you thinking of taking?

523
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,310
We were supposed
to get the entire set,

524
00:24:02,413 --> 00:24:03,965
but we would leave
behind the spear.

525
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,620
This isn't about
trying to, like,

526
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:07,424
- absolutely pilfer you guys.
- Demoralize. - Yeah.

527
00:24:07,448 --> 00:24:09,010
Throughout the entire
time of meeting them

528
00:24:09,034 --> 00:24:10,493
and getting the
pleasantries out of the way,

529
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:12,034
all I'm thinking to myself is,

530
00:24:12,137 --> 00:24:13,734
"how can I put this
goodwill advantage to use?"

531
00:24:13,758 --> 00:24:15,079
You know, would
it be cool if I, like,

532
00:24:15,103 --> 00:24:16,424
met with some of
you guys individually?

533
00:24:16,448 --> 00:24:18,482
Maybe have, like, a little
bit more genuine sense?

534
00:24:18,586 --> 00:24:20,010
You know, it's hard to kind
of, like, talk to everybody.

535
00:24:20,034 --> 00:24:21,517
- You know what I mean?
- For sure.

536
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,931
What information can I
gather to make a decision?

537
00:24:26,379 --> 00:24:27,689
Yeah. Yeah.

538
00:24:36,724 --> 00:24:39,413
Kaleb comes in peace,
and, "hey, you guys,

539
00:24:39,517 --> 00:24:42,172
you know that we
have to do this."

540
00:24:42,275 --> 00:24:43,862
But he's definitely

541
00:24:44,827 --> 00:24:46,137
a player.

542
00:24:46,241 --> 00:24:48,724
- So, y'all, he is a salesman.
- He's a player.

543
00:24:48,827 --> 00:24:50,769
- Yeah, he's a player. He's in sales.
- He is playing...

544
00:24:50,793 --> 00:24:53,310
- What's his job?
- Marketing, but he's in sales.

545
00:24:53,413 --> 00:24:56,068
When it came down to
it, the thing he wanted...

546
00:24:56,172 --> 00:24:59,517
Which was so
smart... is information.

547
00:25:02,344 --> 00:25:04,482
No. I have the
safety without power.

548
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,482
Drew telling me that, yes,

549
00:25:06,586 --> 00:25:08,827
he went to the journey, and,
yes, he got an advantage,

550
00:25:08,931 --> 00:25:10,793
means that he's a
player in this game.

551
00:25:10,896 --> 00:25:12,068
And I like that.

552
00:25:12,172 --> 00:25:13,562
I got an advantage
to give to somebody

553
00:25:13,586 --> 00:25:14,838
- on this tribe.
- You're kidding.

554
00:25:14,862 --> 00:25:16,724
This is the goodwill advantage.

555
00:25:16,827 --> 00:25:19,368
Essentially, if somebody
has lost their vote...

556
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:19,758
Okay.

557
00:25:19,862 --> 00:25:22,586
It allows you to at least
have that chance to...

558
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:24,965
To vote anyways and
use this to counteract that.

559
00:25:25,068 --> 00:25:26,689
Interesting.

560
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:28,809
I'd like to give it to
you, start building trust.

561
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:29,113
Yeah.

562
00:25:29,137 --> 00:25:30,862
I don't think that
people really see us...

563
00:25:30,965 --> 00:25:32,700
- No, I don't think so, either.
- Working together quickly.

564
00:25:32,724 --> 00:25:34,827
- And I think you're here to play.
- Yeah, I hope so.

565
00:25:34,931 --> 00:25:37,827
Kaleb gives me this
beautiful piece of paper,

566
00:25:37,931 --> 00:25:39,379
goodwill advantage.

567
00:25:39,482 --> 00:25:41,965
And right off the bat, goodwill.

568
00:25:42,068 --> 00:25:43,241
He likes me.

569
00:25:43,344 --> 00:25:45,137
Advantage. He's
trying to help me.

570
00:25:45,241 --> 00:25:48,310
And so, right away, he tells
me that with this advantage

571
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:50,827
you can vote at
one tribal council,

572
00:25:50,931 --> 00:25:52,689
even if you have lost your vote.

573
00:25:52,793 --> 00:25:54,620
And this is an
excellent advantage,

574
00:25:54,724 --> 00:25:56,344
not for me, but
for my dear buddy

575
00:25:56,448 --> 00:25:58,620
Austin, who doesn't have a vote.

576
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,389
I've had really good
conversations with everybody,

577
00:26:00,413 --> 00:26:01,931
and I feel like if
there is a swap,

578
00:26:02,034 --> 00:26:03,793
I will let our tribe know

579
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,632
that I feel really good
about you guys as well.

580
00:26:05,656 --> 00:26:05,907
Yeah.

581
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,172
- 100%.
- Okay?

582
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:08,620
Today was a really good day.

583
00:26:08,724 --> 00:26:11,517
I was ecstatic about
how this raid went.

584
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,172
I think not only did I
maximize the supplies,

585
00:26:14,275 --> 00:26:15,596
I maximized the
absolute most amount

586
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,300
of information that I
could have gathered.

587
00:26:19,586 --> 00:26:20,793
What is it?

588
00:26:21,896 --> 00:26:23,310
"Goodwill advantage.

589
00:26:23,413 --> 00:26:25,320
It allows somebody who
has lost their vote to vote."

590
00:26:25,344 --> 00:26:28,448
The plan is definitely
to tell Julie and Dee

591
00:26:28,551 --> 00:26:29,862
about the goodwill advantage,

592
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:32,655
because we didn't
tell Dee about the idol

593
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,482
and she was a little fussy
about it, you know? She was like,

594
00:26:35,586 --> 00:26:37,389
"are you keeping things
from me?" She was suspicious.

595
00:26:37,413 --> 00:26:40,620
So right away when
I get it, I tell the truth.

596
00:26:48,758 --> 00:26:50,172
- This is huge.
- Yeah.

597
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,517
This advantage

598
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,896
I mean, music to my
ears. Like, this is fantastic.

599
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,655
I don't have a vote, so
for me, that is exactly

600
00:26:57,758 --> 00:27:00,655
what I need. Hopefully
not anytime soon,

601
00:27:00,758 --> 00:27:01,965
but it's always nice

602
00:27:02,068 --> 00:27:03,896
to have one little
piece of protection

603
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,448
if this stupid frigging
idol isn't found.

604
00:27:09,413 --> 00:27:11,000
- Man.
- Yeah.

605
00:27:11,103 --> 00:27:12,862
I can't believe
we're eating grapes.

606
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,172
- I forgot what grapes tasted like.
- I know.

607
00:27:15,275 --> 00:27:16,758
Best day of my life.

608
00:27:16,862 --> 00:27:18,665
- For real.
- I can't believe that this morning

609
00:27:18,689 --> 00:27:20,379
we were eating raw papaya.

610
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,517
We are no longer
the Lulu losers.

611
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,793
We have been down and out.

612
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:28,310
We've been defeated
multiple times,

613
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:29,896
over and over and over.

614
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And to finally win
feels super great.

615
00:27:34,103 --> 00:27:35,527
- We killed that challenge.
- Honestly,

616
00:27:35,551 --> 00:27:37,241
- we killed it.
- We did so well.

617
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,896
When Kaleb threw
that toss, it was like

618
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,485
I literally ran into
his arms. I was like

619
00:27:42,509 --> 00:27:43,000
I know.

620
00:27:43,103 --> 00:27:45,263
I've never jumped in
somebody's arms like that before.

621
00:27:45,344 --> 00:27:46,689
And you know what?

622
00:27:46,793 --> 00:27:48,931
We're gonna go into that
immunity challenge tomorrow,

623
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,827
and we are going to crush it.

624
00:27:51,931 --> 00:27:54,655
Emily really made
a shift in her energy,

625
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:57,689
in her conversations,
in her demeanor.

626
00:27:57,793 --> 00:28:01,103
And now that she's
a little more calm

627
00:28:01,206 --> 00:28:02,724
and not as chaotic,

628
00:28:02,827 --> 00:28:06,137
I'm like, "okay, this
Emily I can work with."

629
00:28:06,241 --> 00:28:11,655
And so we have the right
ingredients now to win.

630
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,655
I mean it when I say,
like, "I'm with you."

631
00:28:17,758 --> 00:28:19,620
Yes. And that's that.

632
00:28:19,724 --> 00:28:22,604
- No, seriously, like... right.
- I really don't care about anybody else.

633
00:28:22,655 --> 00:28:24,695
- So, like, if... right.
- But I'm acting like I am.

634
00:28:24,724 --> 00:28:26,068
Me, Kaleb and Sean...

635
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:27,527
We've been together
from the beginning.

636
00:28:27,551 --> 00:28:30,137
I love Kaleb. He's a great guy.

637
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:33,482
But I know I do not want
to sit with Kaleb at the end.

638
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:36,482
Of course, Kaleb,
great guy, very likable.

639
00:28:36,586 --> 00:28:38,758
- And he's a very eloquent speaker.
- Yeah.

640
00:28:38,862 --> 00:28:39,896
Yep.

641
00:28:40,931 --> 00:28:43,000
I mean, did you see him
in the challenge today?

642
00:28:43,103 --> 00:28:44,241
I know.

643
00:28:44,344 --> 00:28:46,000
Yep. Killed it.

644
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:51,793
Is it too early?

645
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,320
It's very early.
Don't get me wrong.

646
00:28:53,344 --> 00:28:57,034
But doing it now, we
wouldn't have to rely

647
00:28:57,137 --> 00:29:01,206
on other people that we don't
really know to vote for him.

648
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:04,413
It would just be our
decision. And that's that.

649
00:29:04,517 --> 00:29:04,879
Yeah.

650
00:29:04,903 --> 00:29:07,551
I would love not to go
back to tribal council,

651
00:29:07,655 --> 00:29:11,310
but if we have to
go, Kaleb's a beast.

652
00:29:11,413 --> 00:29:14,310
He is the biggest
threat on this beach.

653
00:29:14,413 --> 00:29:15,689
Come on.

654
00:29:15,793 --> 00:29:17,241
I still don't have my vote.

655
00:29:17,344 --> 00:29:20,000
We actually need to talk
to you about something.

656
00:29:20,103 --> 00:29:22,103
So it's very, very important...

657
00:29:22,206 --> 00:29:23,655
Your behavior... no.

658
00:29:24,793 --> 00:29:26,172
Don't do that to me.

659
00:29:26,275 --> 00:29:28,689
To get Emily to vote Kaleb out.

660
00:29:28,793 --> 00:29:31,344
- Me and Sean both kind of agree...
- Really?

661
00:29:31,448 --> 00:29:35,206
That none of us want to
sit with Kaleb at the end.

662
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,566
Yeah. Yeah. He wins. I agree.

663
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,448
He's already proven
himself to the whole...

664
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:39,620
- Yeah. - Yeah.
- He wins.

665
00:29:39,724 --> 00:29:41,620
The smile and
the hair and the...

666
00:29:41,724 --> 00:29:43,355
- "Hey, how you doing? What's up?"
- And the story.

667
00:29:43,379 --> 00:29:45,172
- And the story.
- Yeah.

668
00:29:45,275 --> 00:29:47,793
Because I'm aware of the fact

669
00:29:47,896 --> 00:29:50,379
that it's, you know, a strong
situation that I go home

670
00:29:50,482 --> 00:29:53,655
if we lose, then I
am open to anything.

671
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:55,379
If you guys tell
me who to vote for,

672
00:29:55,482 --> 00:29:56,862
I will vote for that person.

673
00:29:56,965 --> 00:29:58,103
My jaw just drops.

674
00:29:58,206 --> 00:30:00,034
I mean, I'm shocked,
because I've seen

675
00:30:00,137 --> 00:30:01,896
those three as a
power three for a while.

676
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,103
We have this new trust
thing going on with you.

677
00:30:04,206 --> 00:30:06,000
- It's got to be Kaleb.
- Yeah.

678
00:30:06,103 --> 00:30:07,700
Is that him? Is that him
coming up? I think that is him.

679
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:09,458
- I heard woo-ing.
- I guess we should go greet him.

680
00:30:09,482 --> 00:30:11,896
There's a lot of
situations that are

681
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,440
running around in
my head right now.

682
00:30:13,517 --> 00:30:15,137
My gosh.

683
00:30:15,241 --> 00:30:17,689
On one hand, I have Kaleb,
who has been really kind to me

684
00:30:17,793 --> 00:30:19,079
ever since the
first tribal council.

685
00:30:19,103 --> 00:30:20,320
And he's come up to me and said,

686
00:30:20,344 --> 00:30:21,384
"I want to work with you."

687
00:30:22,344 --> 00:30:25,793
But at the same time, he's
an extremely social player,

688
00:30:25,896 --> 00:30:28,344
in a way that I'm not
and that Sean's not.

689
00:30:28,448 --> 00:30:31,310
And sabiyah's social, but
not to the extent that Kaleb is.

690
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,838
Kaleb is kind of running the
social game around here at Lulu.

691
00:30:33,862 --> 00:30:35,793
They were like, "we love Lulu."

692
00:30:35,896 --> 00:30:38,056
So I think there's some
opportunity to work with them.

693
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:39,517
I don't think Kaleb
is quite aware

694
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,220
that there have been
those conversations

695
00:30:41,275 --> 00:30:43,931
around what a
threat he is, socially.

696
00:30:45,689 --> 00:30:48,113
It seems to me that he's lacking
a little bit of the perspective

697
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:51,000
of what a threat these social
connections have made him.

698
00:30:59,517 --> 00:31:01,413
- Have fun!
- Thank you.

699
00:31:01,517 --> 00:31:05,103
Goodbye, sailors. Au revoir.

700
00:31:12,517 --> 00:31:14,896
Today, the boys
took the raft out, and

701
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,251
we were out there
having a great time.

702
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:17,448
We were out there, you know,

703
00:31:17,551 --> 00:31:19,517
trying to provide for the tribe.

704
00:31:21,517 --> 00:31:24,034
There's nothing like it.

705
00:31:24,137 --> 00:31:26,724
It's like going
to another world.

706
00:31:26,827 --> 00:31:29,275
It's just me, the
fish, the coral,

707
00:31:29,379 --> 00:31:30,931
and I'm the king down there.

708
00:31:31,034 --> 00:31:33,620
There's nothing bigger than
me down there, so, I'm the boss.

709
00:31:37,793 --> 00:31:40,931
Jake... I had, like, a
small talk with him... finally.

710
00:31:41,034 --> 00:31:43,103
- Okay. What did he say?
- And it's like, "hey,"

711
00:31:43,206 --> 00:31:44,734
"like, we haven't
really talked, and, like,

712
00:31:44,758 --> 00:31:46,793
"I really like you,
and I feel like

713
00:31:46,896 --> 00:31:48,769
we've been connecting a lot
over the past, like, two days."

714
00:31:48,793 --> 00:31:50,079
And he's like, "I
know." He's like,

715
00:31:50,103 --> 00:31:51,793
"that's my fault. I'm so sorry."

716
00:31:55,034 --> 00:31:56,551
I think the looming threat

717
00:31:56,655 --> 00:31:58,724
of tribal council is
on everyone's mind.

718
00:31:58,827 --> 00:32:00,068
It's been on everyone's mind,

719
00:32:00,172 --> 00:32:02,241
especially after
losing a challenge.

720
00:32:02,344 --> 00:32:05,034
So, the boys decide
to take out the raft,

721
00:32:05,137 --> 00:32:06,777
and then, I'm back
behind with the girls,

722
00:32:06,862 --> 00:32:09,000
so we have an
opportunity to talk

723
00:32:09,103 --> 00:32:11,344
pretty freely while
they're out on the water.

724
00:32:11,448 --> 00:32:13,976
Jake is not an option,
I feel like, at this point.

725
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Okay.

726
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:21,896
Bruce is annoying, and

727
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,206
I get the vibe that my
tribe... they love Bruce.

728
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:29,206
So any slight thing that
they say about Bruce

729
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:32,827
in a negative way... I
want to validate, highlight,

730
00:32:32,931 --> 00:32:34,689
emphasize, like, repeat

731
00:32:34,793 --> 00:32:37,241
over and over again
in order to make sure

732
00:32:37,344 --> 00:32:39,413
they feel comfortable
voting Bruce out.

733
00:32:39,517 --> 00:32:41,397
You think it might be a
good idea to get Bruce?

734
00:32:42,413 --> 00:32:46,137
He's a dangerous player as
far as, like, merge goes, 'cause

735
00:32:46,241 --> 00:32:48,172
people are either gonna
love him or hate him.

736
00:32:48,275 --> 00:32:49,931
What did Jeff say?

737
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,172
"Play like it's your
second time." For Bruce,

738
00:32:52,275 --> 00:32:53,838
- it's his second time.
- It is his second time.

739
00:32:53,862 --> 00:32:55,010
Katurah wants to target Bruce,

740
00:32:55,034 --> 00:32:58,862
but Brando is my number
one, so I know I need

741
00:32:58,965 --> 00:33:00,206
to talk to Brando.

742
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,551
I'm in the middle with you.

743
00:33:01,655 --> 00:33:02,941
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's you and me.

744
00:33:02,965 --> 00:33:04,275
Yeah, definitely.

745
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:06,320
- So I want us... I want us to touch base.
- Yeah.

746
00:33:06,344 --> 00:33:08,586
We're right in the middle
'cause on the one side,

747
00:33:08,689 --> 00:33:10,320
you know, we have the
boys you can go with.

748
00:33:10,344 --> 00:33:11,827
On one side, we
have the girls, so

749
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:13,275
we're in the hot seat.

750
00:33:15,517 --> 00:33:17,000
Yeah.

751
00:33:18,034 --> 00:33:19,655
Yeah.

752
00:33:19,758 --> 00:33:21,172
I want us to debate

753
00:33:21,275 --> 00:33:23,235
and to make sure that
we make the right decision.

754
00:33:24,793 --> 00:33:26,103
She's a little scary.

755
00:33:26,206 --> 00:33:27,448
When I cast that vote,

756
00:33:27,551 --> 00:33:29,000
the line is drawn in the sand,

757
00:33:29,103 --> 00:33:30,758
and I will piss off some people.

758
00:33:48,241 --> 00:33:51,172
- Last night, we were crabbing, hunting.
- Yeah.

759
00:33:51,275 --> 00:33:53,965
- We found a beware advantage.
- Yeah.

760
00:33:54,068 --> 00:33:56,724
The first thing that came
out was a clue, which was...

761
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:58,907
Well, there's multiple
tasks that have to be solved.

762
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,586
The first one was to
decode that message.

763
00:34:01,689 --> 00:34:04,000
- So, I got a piece of paper.
- Yeah.

764
00:34:04,103 --> 00:34:05,872
It's, like, the bottom half,
and you just line it up,

765
00:34:05,896 --> 00:34:07,456
and then, eventually,
it spells a word.

766
00:34:07,517 --> 00:34:08,803
So it took, like,
literally, like, a minute

767
00:34:08,827 --> 00:34:10,241
once you had the...

768
00:34:13,241 --> 00:34:14,620
Drew and I want to continue

769
00:34:14,724 --> 00:34:19,862
to build strong trust,
so, I came... 80% clean.

770
00:34:19,965 --> 00:34:22,172
You know, I-I told
Dee and Julie that,

771
00:34:22,275 --> 00:34:25,551
"hey, I found the
beware advantage."

772
00:34:25,655 --> 00:34:28,000
But what I lied about
was when I found it.

773
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:31,757
All good.

774
00:34:33,034 --> 00:34:34,516
Yeah, yeah. Okay,
thank you guys.

775
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,241
- Yeah. - Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

776
00:34:36,344 --> 00:34:37,596
You know, I don't
think they would have

777
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,896
told us had we not caught drew.

778
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,896
But regardless, the
moment that we found out

779
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,320
that he did find a
beware advantage,

780
00:34:42,344 --> 00:34:43,724
and he was looking for an idol,

781
00:34:43,827 --> 00:34:46,688
mama Julie and I... we
decided that it's like, "hey."

782
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:47,941
"All right, we're
gonna work together,

783
00:34:47,965 --> 00:34:49,251
and we're gonna
help you find this idol."

784
00:34:49,275 --> 00:34:50,896
I'm pretty sure
it's in this area.

785
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,482
What we have to
do is just dig around.

786
00:34:54,585 --> 00:34:56,688
- Okay.
- Yeah.

787
00:35:02,034 --> 00:35:04,206
So right now, the plan is,

788
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,827
one person babysits sifu and j.

789
00:35:05,931 --> 00:35:07,827
While the rest of
us start looking.

790
00:35:07,931 --> 00:35:10,068
And if we can pull
something like that off

791
00:35:10,172 --> 00:35:12,103
and have three people digging,

792
00:35:12,206 --> 00:35:14,079
we might be able to find
this sooner rather than later,

793
00:35:14,103 --> 00:35:16,931
and I need this badly.

794
00:35:17,034 --> 00:35:19,827
We've dug around here,
we've dug around there.

795
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:22,965
- I don't know.
- Like, what the heck.

796
00:35:25,344 --> 00:35:27,241
We cannot find the idol,

797
00:35:27,344 --> 00:35:29,275
and honestly, I am
ready to give up.

798
00:35:31,448 --> 00:35:33,931
- We got to think smarter, not harder.
- Yeah.

799
00:35:38,655 --> 00:35:40,724
What the hell?

800
00:35:42,413 --> 00:35:46,758
So under the palm tree,
I see a rope, and I'm like,

801
00:35:46,862 --> 00:35:49,931
"what the hell is a rope
doing under the soil?"

802
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,862
And we're like, "god, please",

803
00:35:56,965 --> 00:35:58,586
"please, please,
please, let this be it.

804
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:01,689
Like, this will change
the entire game right now."

805
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:17,034
"Break a rock near water well."

806
00:36:17,137 --> 00:36:18,620
- Okay, so...
- You got something?

807
00:36:18,724 --> 00:36:20,700
That rope looks obvious,
though. They're gonna know.

808
00:36:20,724 --> 00:36:21,931
- Okay.
- So let's hide it.

809
00:36:22,034 --> 00:36:23,137
So we're freaking out.

810
00:36:23,241 --> 00:36:25,034
We're, like, going
crazy. We're like,

811
00:36:25,137 --> 00:36:26,896
"okay, let's put
the evidence back."

812
00:36:29,034 --> 00:36:31,724
So we threw the rope away where
we knew nobody would go grab it,

813
00:36:31,827 --> 00:36:34,655
and in that exact same moment,

814
00:36:34,758 --> 00:36:36,275
j. Was walking towards us.

815
00:36:36,379 --> 00:36:39,551
Ooh. So I don't know. Maybe
we should look around here.

816
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,838
What do you think, around here?

817
00:36:40,862 --> 00:36:42,000
Mama Julie and I are, like,

818
00:36:42,103 --> 00:36:43,551
in an unspoken agreement.

819
00:36:43,655 --> 00:36:45,700
Like, "dude, we need to
put our best acting faces on."

820
00:36:45,724 --> 00:36:48,620
I'm gonna look over there.
You guys want to spread out?

821
00:36:48,724 --> 00:36:50,320
- Yeah, let's do it. I'll look here.
- All right.

822
00:36:50,344 --> 00:36:53,344
I don't want j.
Suspicious, but right now,

823
00:36:53,448 --> 00:36:57,586
I've got to get this
hammer to Austin, asap.

824
00:36:57,689 --> 00:36:59,275
What do we got here?

825
00:36:59,379 --> 00:37:01,206
Julie hands me a hammer

826
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,896
that says, "break a
rock near water well."

827
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,689
- Right now, you need...
- Go, go, go, go.

828
00:37:06,793 --> 00:37:09,275
At this point, my
heart is racing.

829
00:37:09,379 --> 00:37:10,700
In my head, I was
like, "I'm never gonna

830
00:37:10,724 --> 00:37:11,965
get past the stage of digging."

831
00:37:12,068 --> 00:37:13,379
And the fact that we got past it

832
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:15,551
is, like, I was
exhausted, I was tired.

833
00:37:15,655 --> 00:37:17,251
And all of a sudden, I had
all the energy in the world.

834
00:37:17,275 --> 00:37:19,586
- Do you want to do it?
- Yeah.

835
00:37:21,931 --> 00:37:24,344
Okay.

836
00:37:25,379 --> 00:37:26,689
- Okay.
- Okay.

837
00:37:28,517 --> 00:37:30,344
Okay.

838
00:37:35,241 --> 00:37:38,068
My god. My god.

839
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,172
Okay, let's see what it says.

840
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:46,586
What does it say?

841
00:37:48,793 --> 00:37:50,931
As soon as I read that sentence,

842
00:37:51,034 --> 00:37:52,734
I hugged drew, we start
jumping, we're cheering.

843
00:37:52,758 --> 00:37:54,517
Like, I have my vote
back. We have an idol.

844
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,380
It's, like, the greatest
moment of all time.

845
00:37:59,413 --> 00:38:00,482
This has a lot of text.

846
00:38:00,586 --> 00:38:02,000
So I start reading it

847
00:38:02,103 --> 00:38:04,344
and immediately, I get
slapped in the face with,

848
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:08,655
"this idol is only good
for one tribal council."

849
00:38:08,758 --> 00:38:11,241
And I'm like, "are
you kidding me?"

850
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:36,172
- So...
- Nobody's gonna believe it, but...

851
00:38:36,275 --> 00:38:37,922
The mechanics of this
are very complicated.

852
00:38:37,946 --> 00:38:38,355
They are.

853
00:38:38,379 --> 00:38:42,034
This idol is new
because it's conditional.

854
00:38:42,137 --> 00:38:43,448
It has a very short lifespan,

855
00:38:43,551 --> 00:38:44,871
but you can
extend that lifespan.

856
00:38:44,931 --> 00:38:46,551
You can buy some health care.

857
00:38:46,655 --> 00:38:48,769
- What a good day, what a good freaking...
- Let's go.

858
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:51,827
If you sacrifice your vote
that first tribal council,

859
00:38:51,931 --> 00:38:53,379
oop, you're after the merge.

860
00:38:53,482 --> 00:38:54,965
You know, can
live a little longer.

861
00:38:55,068 --> 00:38:57,034
If you sacrifice your
vote that second time,

862
00:38:57,137 --> 00:38:59,206
oop, all the way to
the end of the game,

863
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,793
all the way to the final five.

864
00:39:00,896 --> 00:39:04,413
It is as good as a legitimate,
real, tried and true idol.

865
00:39:04,517 --> 00:39:06,103
- You're kidding me.
- Are you kidding?

866
00:39:06,206 --> 00:39:08,079
- Yeah. -It's... you're kidding.
- You're kidding.

867
00:39:08,103 --> 00:39:09,586
Mama Julie and I...

868
00:39:09,689 --> 00:39:11,527
We didn't really need to
give that hammer away.

869
00:39:11,551 --> 00:39:13,527
We could have gone to
the water well by ourselves,

870
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,271
smashed it and kept
the idol for ourselves.

871
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:18,931
But to be honest, at this
point, good alliances...

872
00:39:19,034 --> 00:39:20,914
That's what's gonna get
me further in the game.

873
00:39:20,965 --> 00:39:22,344
We're good.

874
00:39:23,931 --> 00:39:25,551
Solid.

875
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:28,103
And also, it solidified
the four of us.

876
00:39:28,206 --> 00:39:30,310
Now we know that there is trust.

877
00:39:30,413 --> 00:39:31,931
You know, like,
before, we felt it.

878
00:39:32,034 --> 00:39:34,241
Now we can prove
that there is trust.

879
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,620
- Love you.
- I love you so much.

880
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,827
Come on in.

881
00:39:57,551 --> 00:39:59,275
Good morning, reba.

882
00:39:59,379 --> 00:40:00,965
Good morning, Jeff.

883
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:03,310
- Good morning, Lulu.
- Morning, Jeff.

884
00:40:03,413 --> 00:40:05,413
Good morning, belo.

885
00:40:05,517 --> 00:40:08,000
- Jeffrey.
- Good morning.

886
00:40:08,103 --> 00:40:10,000
All right.

887
00:40:10,103 --> 00:40:12,068
Shall we get to today's
immunity challenge?

888
00:40:12,172 --> 00:40:13,413
First things first.

889
00:40:13,517 --> 00:40:14,597
Got to take back the idols.

890
00:40:14,689 --> 00:40:17,482
Come on, j.

891
00:40:17,586 --> 00:40:19,562
We'd like to exchange
this one for the bigger one.

892
00:40:19,586 --> 00:40:21,137
Okay.

893
00:40:24,793 --> 00:40:27,827
Once again, immunity
is back for grabs.

894
00:40:29,965 --> 00:40:31,586
For today's challenge,

895
00:40:31,689 --> 00:40:32,976
you're gonna
race out with a cart

896
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,482
and release two keys.

897
00:40:34,586 --> 00:40:38,448
Those keys will release
very heavy puzzle pieces

898
00:40:38,551 --> 00:40:40,344
that you're gonna
put on your cart.

899
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:43,241
Then you're then gonna
take your cart apart,

900
00:40:43,344 --> 00:40:46,103
get it through a barricade
and reassemble it.

901
00:40:46,206 --> 00:40:47,862
Once you reach the end,

902
00:40:47,965 --> 00:40:51,137
one person will be
your caller, your eyes.

903
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:53,206
The rest of the group
will work together

904
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:56,862
to solve a massive cube puzzle.

905
00:40:56,965 --> 00:40:58,655
First two tribes to finish

906
00:40:58,758 --> 00:41:01,344
win immunity,
safe from the vote.

907
00:41:01,448 --> 00:41:03,206
Losers, tribal council

908
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:07,206
where somebody will be the
third person voted out of survivor45,

909
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:09,482
and as a penalty for
losing... sorry for you

910
00:41:09,586 --> 00:41:11,137
I will take your flint.

911
00:41:11,241 --> 00:41:15,689
Lulu, remarkably, still have
not had flint, seven days in.

912
00:41:15,793 --> 00:41:18,068
Sit-outs. Reba, sitting out two.

913
00:41:18,172 --> 00:41:20,931
Cannot sit out the same person
in back-to-back challenges.

914
00:41:21,034 --> 00:41:22,482
Who's gonna sit out of this?

915
00:41:22,586 --> 00:41:24,000
We're both sitting out.

916
00:41:24,103 --> 00:41:25,689
Julie and Dee are gonna sit out.

917
00:41:25,793 --> 00:41:27,241
Belo, two extra people.

918
00:41:27,344 --> 00:41:28,976
Sit-outs today gonna
be Brando and kellie.

919
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,931
Sit-outs, take a
spot on the bench.

920
00:41:31,034 --> 00:41:32,803
Everybody else, give
you a minute to strategize.

921
00:41:32,827 --> 00:41:35,137
Get it on! Here we go.

922
00:41:43,241 --> 00:41:45,413
All right, here we go.

923
00:41:45,517 --> 00:41:47,896
- For immunity.
- Best of luck. Best of luck.

924
00:41:49,517 --> 00:41:51,068
Survivors ready?

925
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Go!

926
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:59,310
- Let's go!
- First you got to get your cart

927
00:41:59,413 --> 00:42:02,344
to that first stopping point.

928
00:42:02,448 --> 00:42:04,827
You're good, you're
good, you're good!

929
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:07,758
You got to release your pole...

930
00:42:07,862 --> 00:42:10,137
- Go, Sean.
- And then knock the key off.

931
00:42:10,241 --> 00:42:11,413
You've got it, Austin.

932
00:42:11,517 --> 00:42:14,586
- Yeah!
- Austin has his.

933
00:42:14,689 --> 00:42:16,862
- Get it, Kendra!
- Beautiful.

934
00:42:16,965 --> 00:42:18,206
Kendra has hers.

935
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:19,689
- Yeah, Kendra!
- Yes, girl!

936
00:42:19,793 --> 00:42:21,379
Reba and belo
did it very quickly.

937
00:42:21,482 --> 00:42:23,379
Lulu taking a long time.

938
00:42:23,482 --> 00:42:26,241
You got to get your
puzzle piece on.

939
00:42:28,275 --> 00:42:30,931
- Come on, reba!
- Yeah, reba! Let's go!

940
00:42:33,206 --> 00:42:35,241
- Sean's still working.
- No. No, not through.

941
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,241
From the top.
There you go. Push.

942
00:42:37,344 --> 00:42:38,931
- There we go.
- There it is for Lulu!

943
00:42:39,034 --> 00:42:40,275
Aah!

944
00:42:40,379 --> 00:42:42,275
Let's go, belo! Let's go!

945
00:42:42,379 --> 00:42:43,838
Here goes Kendra,
heading up for belo.

946
00:42:43,862 --> 00:42:45,655
Let's go, belo!

947
00:42:45,758 --> 00:42:48,000
Austin again for reba.

948
00:42:48,103 --> 00:42:49,344
Come on, reba! You got this!

949
00:42:49,448 --> 00:42:50,931
Austin has the key!

950
00:42:51,034 --> 00:42:52,965
Okay, reba!

951
00:42:53,068 --> 00:42:54,965
Kendra has the key for belo.

952
00:42:55,068 --> 00:42:57,551
Sean working on that key.

953
00:42:57,655 --> 00:42:59,137
Yeah, from the top. You got it.

954
00:42:59,241 --> 00:43:00,631
- You got it, you got it.
- There you go.

955
00:43:00,655 --> 00:43:02,135
- And he's got it!
- Good job, buddy.

956
00:43:02,172 --> 00:43:04,206
- Good job. Good job.
- That's right, belo!

957
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,655
- Keep it up!
- Belo's through.

958
00:43:06,758 --> 00:43:08,965
Now you can start
taking it apart...

959
00:43:09,068 --> 00:43:12,758
And getting their cart
through the barricade.

960
00:43:14,655 --> 00:43:16,620
Here comes Lulu and reba.

961
00:43:16,724 --> 00:43:18,448
Come on, baby. Let's go, Lulu.

962
00:43:18,551 --> 00:43:20,655
Lulu's made up some time.

963
00:43:21,758 --> 00:43:24,034
- We got a challenge right now.
- Yes!

964
00:43:24,137 --> 00:43:25,862
- Raise.
- Come on, come on, come on.

965
00:43:25,965 --> 00:43:27,896
Belo still in the lead.

966
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,320
- Yes!
- Watch your fingers. Watch your fingers.

967
00:43:29,344 --> 00:43:30,862
Push! Yeah!

968
00:43:30,965 --> 00:43:34,241
- Yes!
- Belo has everything through.

969
00:43:35,586 --> 00:43:37,226
Lulu's working to get
everything through.

970
00:43:37,275 --> 00:43:39,103
Let's go!

971
00:43:39,206 --> 00:43:41,000
- Now we go. Perfect.
- I'll go.

972
00:43:41,103 --> 00:43:42,758
Let's lift.

973
00:43:42,862 --> 00:43:44,793
Reba has hit a roadblock.

974
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,551
Puzzle pieces that they put
through first are blocking them.

975
00:43:49,655 --> 00:43:51,241
Got to go.

976
00:43:51,344 --> 00:43:53,655
Belo may have their
cart back together.

977
00:43:53,758 --> 00:43:55,482
- Go! - Yeah!
- Yeah, belo!

978
00:43:55,586 --> 00:43:57,172
It is belo back on the move.

979
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:01,000
Ripping through that obstacle.

980
00:44:02,034 --> 00:44:03,689
That's how you do it!

981
00:44:03,793 --> 00:44:05,379
Push, belo! Push!

982
00:44:05,482 --> 00:44:07,310
Now you got to get
your puzzle pieces

983
00:44:07,413 --> 00:44:11,310
on that stack before you
start working on the puzzle.

984
00:44:11,413 --> 00:44:13,206
That's right, belo! Keep it up!

985
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:15,379
We've got Lulu.

986
00:44:15,482 --> 00:44:16,379
Watch your feet.

987
00:44:16,482 --> 00:44:18,448
Let's go fast!

988
00:44:18,551 --> 00:44:20,448
- You're good, Lulu.
- Let's go.

989
00:44:20,551 --> 00:44:23,655
Lulu win less in
immunity challenges.

990
00:44:23,758 --> 00:44:25,103
Will that change?

991
00:44:25,206 --> 00:44:26,793
They are back in this.

992
00:44:28,724 --> 00:44:30,724
Ready? Yeah.

993
00:44:30,827 --> 00:44:32,103
Here comes reba now.

994
00:44:32,206 --> 00:44:34,517
Go! Go! Keep going!

995
00:44:37,379 --> 00:44:38,620
You got it! Go, go, go!

996
00:44:38,724 --> 00:44:39,862
You're good, reba.

997
00:44:39,965 --> 00:44:41,310
Good job, good job, good job.

998
00:44:41,413 --> 00:44:43,206
Got to get all the
pieces off first.

999
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:45,275
It's gonna be Emily
calling for Lulu.

1000
00:44:45,379 --> 00:44:46,739
Look for a piece
of the "I" piece.

1001
00:44:46,793 --> 00:44:48,724
Kendra calling for belo.

1002
00:44:48,827 --> 00:44:51,147
We need to find something
that goes into this corner here.

1003
00:44:51,551 --> 00:44:52,827
And j. For reba.

1004
00:44:52,931 --> 00:44:54,000
Let's go, j.! You got it!

1005
00:44:54,103 --> 00:44:56,344
This is a massive cube puzzle.

1006
00:44:56,448 --> 00:44:58,586
There we go.

1007
00:44:58,689 --> 00:45:00,482
It fits inside this frame.

1008
00:45:02,827 --> 00:45:05,000
Question is how
does it go together?

1009
00:45:05,103 --> 00:45:07,068
- That's it.
- That worked?

1010
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:08,448
- That's it.
- Guys, this one.

1011
00:45:08,551 --> 00:45:10,482
- I think this one's in the middle.
- Okay.

1012
00:45:12,068 --> 00:45:13,586
I put belo in the
lead right now.

1013
00:45:13,689 --> 00:45:15,965
Then Lulu, then reba.

1014
00:45:20,413 --> 00:45:22,562
No, it doesn't fit. It doesn't
fit, sabiyah. Pull it out.

1015
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:24,562
Look for the parts that
don't have anything on them.

1016
00:45:24,586 --> 00:45:28,137
Lulu, yet to win an immunity
challenge this season.

1017
00:45:29,689 --> 00:45:31,689
They are the only
tribe to go to tribal.

1018
00:45:31,793 --> 00:45:35,034
They won the reward challenge.
Can they do it again here?

1019
00:45:40,448 --> 00:45:42,206
Out the way, out
the way, out the way!

1020
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:44,827
This is where
frustration will set in.

1021
00:45:44,931 --> 00:45:46,793
- Sorry, Kaleb.
- You're exhausted.

1022
00:45:46,896 --> 00:45:48,655
These pieces are heavy.

1023
00:45:56,206 --> 00:45:58,206
- That's it. Yup. Go.
- There we go.

1024
00:45:58,310 --> 00:45:59,700
- Yup, yup.
- Good job. You're almost done.

1025
00:45:59,724 --> 00:46:01,172
Reba now making
a lot of progress.

1026
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:02,976
- You guys, you got to hurry.
- These puzzles can

1027
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,827
- come together very fast.
- Go! Push!

1028
00:46:05,931 --> 00:46:07,068
Reba with another piece.

1029
00:46:08,551 --> 00:46:12,689
Austin, drew, sifu and
j. Doing a great job.

1030
00:46:12,793 --> 00:46:14,689
- Okay. You guys got...
- Are you ready?

1031
00:46:14,793 --> 00:46:16,217
We got to kick it into
gear, and we got to move.

1032
00:46:16,241 --> 00:46:18,793
There we go.

1033
00:46:18,896 --> 00:46:21,482
Belo with another piece
of the outside frame.

1034
00:46:21,586 --> 00:46:23,068
You can't slow down, belo!

1035
00:46:23,172 --> 00:46:25,206
Lulu's taking everything apart.

1036
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:27,630
You want to take that? I'm
gonna work on the bottom piece.

1037
00:46:27,655 --> 00:46:29,344
Sure.

1038
00:46:29,448 --> 00:46:32,206
Sabiyah frustrated
but still laughing.

1039
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:35,103
There goes reba
with another piece.

1040
00:46:35,206 --> 00:46:36,655
And then that goes here.

1041
00:46:36,758 --> 00:46:39,172
- Come on, Jake, Jake!
- Belo with another piece.

1042
00:46:39,275 --> 00:46:41,103
Come on!

1043
00:46:42,137 --> 00:46:44,344
Lulu quickly starting
to fall out of this.

1044
00:46:44,448 --> 00:46:46,068
It's okay, guys.

1045
00:46:46,172 --> 00:46:48,103
It's all right. Just keep going.

1046
00:46:48,206 --> 00:46:49,896
Reba's down to one piece left.

1047
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,896
Yes! Yes!

1048
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,896
Reba has it.

1049
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,689
Reba wins immunity.
We're looking for one more.

1050
00:47:00,931 --> 00:47:02,241
Yes!

1051
00:47:02,344 --> 00:47:04,931
- That goes right there.
- Belo, one piece left.

1052
00:47:05,034 --> 00:47:06,448
They feel it.

1053
00:47:06,551 --> 00:47:07,838
- All right. Awesome.
- Is this it?

1054
00:47:07,862 --> 00:47:09,482
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1055
00:47:09,586 --> 00:47:10,941
- Push in the middle.
- You have time to push?

1056
00:47:10,965 --> 00:47:12,551
- Yup. That's it!
- Yes.

1057
00:47:14,241 --> 00:47:15,931
That's it!

1058
00:47:16,034 --> 00:47:18,103
Yeah, belo!

1059
00:47:18,206 --> 00:47:22,034
Belo wins immunity,
sending Lulu to tribal council

1060
00:47:22,137 --> 00:47:24,034
for the third straight
time this season.

1061
00:47:24,137 --> 00:47:26,275
You're a beast.

1062
00:47:26,379 --> 00:47:28,827
And the emotion
starts to pour out.

1063
00:47:28,931 --> 00:47:30,137
We worked so hard!

1064
00:47:30,241 --> 00:47:31,827
A familiar despair

1065
00:47:31,931 --> 00:47:34,620
- I am so proud of you guys.
- For Lulu.

1066
00:47:36,551 --> 00:47:38,034
It's all right. Take
a deep breath.

1067
00:47:40,827 --> 00:47:44,379
Reba, congratulations again.

1068
00:47:44,482 --> 00:47:46,034
Thank you.

1069
00:47:46,137 --> 00:47:48,896
No tribal tonight. Belo,

1070
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,965
- you pulled it out again.
- Yes. Yes.

1071
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:53,310
Belo stays intact.

1072
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:55,310
Nobody going home.

1073
00:47:55,413 --> 00:47:56,827
Reba, belo, grab your stuff,

1074
00:47:56,931 --> 00:47:58,665
head back to camp.
No tribal council tonight.

1075
00:47:58,689 --> 00:48:00,344
Nobody going home.

1076
00:48:00,448 --> 00:48:02,413
Stay strong, guys. Everybody.

1077
00:48:02,517 --> 00:48:05,482
That is a good
feeling on day seven.

1078
00:48:08,551 --> 00:48:12,379
All right, Emily, you
have this great victory.

1079
00:48:12,482 --> 00:48:13,965
You win the reward.

1080
00:48:14,068 --> 00:48:16,793
But out here, when
it really matters,

1081
00:48:16,896 --> 00:48:18,656
when your life is on
the line, another loss.

1082
00:48:18,724 --> 00:48:20,655
So I know what's gonna
happen back at camp.

1083
00:48:20,758 --> 00:48:24,275
What's the feeling right now
before you get to that strategy?

1084
00:48:24,379 --> 00:48:27,758
It's the worst feeling, and
to tell you the truth, like,

1085
00:48:27,862 --> 00:48:29,689
I go through my stages
of grief differently.

1086
00:48:29,793 --> 00:48:31,275
I'm not sad right
now. I'm angry.

1087
00:48:31,379 --> 00:48:32,838
I'm frustrated 'cause
I just watched belo

1088
00:48:32,862 --> 00:48:34,724
and reba celebrate their victory

1089
00:48:34,827 --> 00:48:36,148
'cause they have
no clue what it's like.

1090
00:48:36,172 --> 00:48:37,355
They have no clue what it's like

1091
00:48:37,379 --> 00:48:38,699
to get to know
people this deeply

1092
00:48:38,758 --> 00:48:40,044
and then go and
then send them home

1093
00:48:40,068 --> 00:48:41,527
because someone's
heart's breaking tonight,

1094
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:43,793
and none of us want that
to happen, but it's going to.

1095
00:48:43,896 --> 00:48:46,689
All right, Lulu,

1096
00:48:46,793 --> 00:48:48,931
three immunity
challenges, three losses.

1097
00:48:49,034 --> 00:48:50,355
Grab your stuff,
head back to camp.

1098
00:48:50,379 --> 00:48:51,734
See you tonight
at tribal council,

1099
00:48:51,758 --> 00:48:53,517
where somebody
will be the third person

1100
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,551
voted out of survivor45.

1101
00:48:55,655 --> 00:48:57,068
Come on.

1102
00:48:57,172 --> 00:48:59,586
Lulu just cannot win.

1103
00:48:59,689 --> 00:49:01,310
I'm exhausted, I'm hungry.

1104
00:49:01,413 --> 00:49:03,413
I'm destroyed from
that immunity challenge.

1105
00:49:03,517 --> 00:49:06,379
But I have gotten hints
from sabiyah and Sean

1106
00:49:06,482 --> 00:49:08,389
that maybe they're interested
in flipping the vote on Kaleb.

1107
00:49:08,413 --> 00:49:10,241
However, realistically,

1108
00:49:10,344 --> 00:49:11,864
I know I'm at the
bottom of this tribe

1109
00:49:11,965 --> 00:49:13,517
and they can take the easy vote

1110
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:16,517
and send me home
at this tribal council. So,

1111
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,965
I'm anxious, I'm shaking,
and I'm honestly afraid.

1112
00:49:34,206 --> 00:49:37,448
Man, that was a huge fall.

1113
00:49:37,551 --> 00:49:40,758
Deep in my gut, I feel
that the only reason

1114
00:49:40,862 --> 00:49:44,275
Lulu won the reward was so
that we can have the inevitable fall

1115
00:49:44,379 --> 00:49:46,458
that we always have coming
into the immunity challenge,

1116
00:49:46,482 --> 00:49:49,620
and losing once again
and once again going

1117
00:49:49,724 --> 00:49:51,103
to tribal council.

1118
00:49:51,206 --> 00:49:52,458
We're gonna be moving
down to three people

1119
00:49:52,482 --> 00:49:54,137
while everybody
else has full teams.

1120
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,379
It's crazy. I can't
believe this is happening.

1121
00:49:59,724 --> 00:50:00,862
Again.

1122
00:50:00,965 --> 00:50:03,068
God. Nobody imagines

1123
00:50:03,172 --> 00:50:04,572
this is what their
survivor journey

1124
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:07,068
- is gonna look like, you know?
- I know.

1125
00:50:07,172 --> 00:50:09,655
Sean and sabiyah are
gonna go after Emily.

1126
00:50:09,758 --> 00:50:11,551
And as much as I
want to work with Emily,

1127
00:50:11,655 --> 00:50:14,068
I don't think I can save her.

1128
00:50:14,172 --> 00:50:15,724
It may be smarter
to try and work

1129
00:50:15,827 --> 00:50:18,724
with Sean and sabiyah
and be able to try and make it

1130
00:50:18,827 --> 00:50:20,027
to the next stage of the game.

1131
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:26,448
And if she does put
her shot in the dark

1132
00:50:26,551 --> 00:50:28,448
I can make it seem
like we're voting you.

1133
00:50:31,206 --> 00:50:33,172
- "Man, we can't win with Kaleb"?
- Yeah.

1134
00:50:33,275 --> 00:50:35,395
Then we don't have to
worry about a shot in the dark.

1135
00:50:38,655 --> 00:50:41,413
- Tell her me.
- You?

1136
00:50:41,517 --> 00:50:43,862
You tell her me
and I'll tell her you.

1137
00:50:43,965 --> 00:50:44,256
Okay.

1138
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,482
We got to be real careful,
and we got to think.

1139
00:50:46,586 --> 00:50:49,323
We got to make sure
our stories are straight.

1140
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:49,758
Yeah.

1141
00:50:49,862 --> 00:50:52,448
It's got to be Kaleb tonight.

1142
00:50:52,551 --> 00:50:55,896
So I'm letting him believe that
he's running the show tonight.

1143
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,965
With a character like Kaleb,

1144
00:50:58,068 --> 00:51:01,206
you got to do it
really, really carefully.

1145
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:04,241
If he even smells that
I feel a different way

1146
00:51:04,344 --> 00:51:06,517
or Sean feels a different way,

1147
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:08,172
he could vote for me.

1148
00:51:08,275 --> 00:51:10,379
I don't have a vote.

1149
00:51:10,482 --> 00:51:12,275
He could-he could tell
Emily to vote for me.

1150
00:51:12,379 --> 00:51:14,355
I'm gonna put my idol in
the fire as soon as we walk in.

1151
00:51:14,379 --> 00:51:16,793
I'm dropping it in the...
'Cause I need the most time

1152
00:51:16,896 --> 00:51:18,827
to let all of the wax melt.

1153
00:51:18,931 --> 00:51:22,275
So, let's try to
drag this tribal out.

1154
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:25,206
Tonight, I plan to drop
that idol in the flames

1155
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:27,758
in the middle of tribal council.

1156
00:51:27,862 --> 00:51:29,275
I'm hoping that that fire

1157
00:51:29,379 --> 00:51:31,344
in the middle is hot
enough to melt it.

1158
00:51:31,448 --> 00:51:34,241
I'm hoping that we sit there
long enough for it to happen.

1159
00:51:34,344 --> 00:51:36,379
I need that idol.

1160
00:51:36,482 --> 00:51:39,034
I need my vote to
be reactivated tonight.

1161
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,275
Yes.

1162
00:51:42,379 --> 00:51:43,631
- Okay, perfect, perfect, perfect.
- Same.

1163
00:51:43,655 --> 00:51:44,965
Okay.

1164
00:51:54,931 --> 00:51:57,931
So I'm gonna have
to burn that at tribal.

1165
00:51:58,034 --> 00:52:00,103
Exactly.

1166
00:52:01,103 --> 00:52:02,206
The idol. Yes.

1167
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:04,413
Okay.

1168
00:52:04,517 --> 00:52:05,862
You're just like.

1169
00:52:08,241 --> 00:52:10,448
Emily feels like
she's on the bottom.

1170
00:52:10,551 --> 00:52:12,965
She feels like she's on the
bottom because she knows

1171
00:52:13,068 --> 00:52:16,172
that there's information that
she's been left out of the loop.

1172
00:52:16,275 --> 00:52:18,931
So I'm telling Emily
that I have an idol

1173
00:52:19,034 --> 00:52:22,344
to cement the trust of our
three because it's Kaleb.

1174
00:52:23,517 --> 00:52:25,517
Yeah.

1175
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,965
What sabiyah and Sean

1176
00:52:27,068 --> 00:52:30,068
want me to do is
to vote out Kaleb.

1177
00:52:30,172 --> 00:52:32,827
But sabiyah pulling out
a waxed immunity idol

1178
00:52:32,931 --> 00:52:34,482
makes me think
that she hasn't been

1179
00:52:34,586 --> 00:52:36,793
honest and truthful with me,
whereas Kaleb has actually

1180
00:52:36,896 --> 00:52:38,482
been willing to work with me.

1181
00:52:38,586 --> 00:52:41,172
So I need to do everything
in my power to keep him here.

1182
00:52:41,275 --> 00:52:43,172
But Kaleb doesn't
realize that it's him.

1183
00:52:43,275 --> 00:52:46,724
Kaleb thinks it's me, and he's
still playing with these guys.

1184
00:52:46,827 --> 00:52:48,344
And unless I tell Kaleb

1185
00:52:48,448 --> 00:52:50,010
that unless he writes
sabiyah's name down tonight,

1186
00:52:50,034 --> 00:52:51,827
he is the one that
is going home.

1187
00:52:56,896 --> 00:52:58,655
It's not me. I know that.

1188
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:01,448
I'm 100% positive they're
writing your name down.

1189
00:53:02,827 --> 00:53:04,389
So I need you to write
sabiyah's name down

1190
00:53:04,413 --> 00:53:06,111
because I'm writing
sabiyah's name down, too.

1191
00:53:06,135 --> 00:53:06,355
I...

1192
00:53:06,379 --> 00:53:08,148
This isn't like, " Emily
trying to save her ass."

1193
00:53:08,172 --> 00:53:09,631
This is Emily trying
to save your ass.

1194
00:53:09,655 --> 00:53:11,379
Whose name are you writing down?

1195
00:53:11,482 --> 00:53:13,758
I'm 100% writing sabiyah's name.

1196
00:53:13,862 --> 00:53:15,620
I'm telling you, I
don't know how to.

1197
00:53:21,827 --> 00:53:23,896
Emily says, "hey, the
votes are against you."

1198
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,586
Do I believe that
100%? Not necessarily.

1199
00:53:27,689 --> 00:53:30,275
Because sabiah's
plan was to tell Emily

1200
00:53:30,379 --> 00:53:31,482
to vote me out tonight.

1201
00:53:31,586 --> 00:53:33,103
And I really do believe

1202
00:53:33,206 --> 00:53:36,241
that sabiyah and Sean
want to work with me.

1203
00:53:36,344 --> 00:53:38,655
So, even though I
absolutely am a possibility

1204
00:53:38,758 --> 00:53:40,172
of going home tonight,

1205
00:53:40,275 --> 00:53:42,137
I don't think that's
how it's gonna go.

1206
00:53:42,241 --> 00:53:45,758
- There's a chance that...
- Okay? I promise. -Okay.

1207
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,344
We're not switching.

1208
00:53:49,448 --> 00:53:50,734
"So you need to
get on board." Yeah.

1209
00:53:50,758 --> 00:53:51,931
Okay.

1210
00:53:52,034 --> 00:53:53,206
Right now, I have two options

1211
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:55,034
in front of me. I can ride

1212
00:53:55,137 --> 00:53:57,068
with my alliance
and take out Emily.

1213
00:53:57,172 --> 00:53:59,586
Alternatively, I can
vote out sabiyah.

1214
00:53:59,689 --> 00:54:02,206
It'd be a big, big, big move.

1215
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:04,724
But what happens if
there's a tie? What happens

1216
00:54:04,827 --> 00:54:06,206
if sabiyah gets her vote back?

1217
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:08,862
I actually haven't fully
made a decision yet here,

1218
00:54:08,965 --> 00:54:10,079
as I'm sitting
here in this forest,

1219
00:54:10,103 --> 00:54:11,217
in terms of what
I'm going to do.

1220
00:54:11,241 --> 00:54:13,206
I've really built myself

1221
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:15,137
in to two different sides,

1222
00:54:15,241 --> 00:54:16,389
and it's now up to me to decide

1223
00:54:16,413 --> 00:54:17,724
what I'm gonna do about it.

1224
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:10,413
All right. Well, let's
start with the obvious.

1225
00:55:10,517 --> 00:55:11,655
What's up, sabiyah?

1226
00:55:11,758 --> 00:55:16,379
So, I found an idol,
but it's in the wax,

1227
00:55:16,482 --> 00:55:18,344
and as you know,
we don't have fire.

1228
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:21,068
So, I haven't had a vote

1229
00:55:21,172 --> 00:55:24,000
since I found it, and,
tonight is just too critical

1230
00:55:24,103 --> 00:55:25,827
- to not have a vote.
- Okay.

1231
00:55:25,931 --> 00:55:28,206
- So I brought some tools.
- Wow.

1232
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:33,620
So, that I can, see
about this. Yeah.

1233
00:55:33,724 --> 00:55:35,620
You know, Tony...
he had a bag of tricks.

1234
00:55:35,724 --> 00:55:38,103
I got a trucker tool set.
You know what I mean?

1235
00:55:38,206 --> 00:55:39,827
- Well, it's burning.
- Exact...

1236
00:55:39,931 --> 00:55:41,551
That's the gist, ain't it?

1237
00:55:41,655 --> 00:55:43,655
I wanted to come out
and just get it over with.

1238
00:55:43,758 --> 00:55:45,655
I mean, these guys...
they've been briefed.

1239
00:55:45,758 --> 00:55:47,620
I mean, if we're
going down to three,

1240
00:55:47,724 --> 00:55:49,034
it's gonna be our alliance

1241
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,458
if there's a possible
switch, possible merge.

1242
00:55:50,482 --> 00:55:52,137
So, you know, this
is gonna potentially

1243
00:55:52,241 --> 00:55:53,724
save one of us
in the future, so...

1244
00:55:54,827 --> 00:55:56,965
Let's check on it.

1245
00:55:58,206 --> 00:56:01,517
I knew that there would be
something in the center, so,

1246
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:04,413
we'll just let that cook for
a little bit, if that's all right.

1247
00:56:04,517 --> 00:56:05,862
All right.

1248
00:56:05,965 --> 00:56:08,103
Well, while that's melting,

1249
00:56:08,206 --> 00:56:09,931
let's review the
past couple of days.

1250
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:12,724
Kaleb, you went
to do a camp raid.

1251
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:15,931
How did that go and what
did you share with the tribe?

1252
00:56:16,034 --> 00:56:17,482
Unfortunately, the only thing

1253
00:56:17,586 --> 00:56:20,103
that we could really steal
of impact was fishing gear,

1254
00:56:20,206 --> 00:56:21,448
and we don't have fire.

1255
00:56:21,551 --> 00:56:23,172
But it was really great

1256
00:56:23,275 --> 00:56:24,872
because I was able to meet
with different members of that tribe

1257
00:56:24,896 --> 00:56:27,793
and bring information
back to our team, which,

1258
00:56:27,896 --> 00:56:29,448
in a swap or in a merge,

1259
00:56:29,551 --> 00:56:32,103
will hopefully help us navigate
the next stage of the game.

1260
00:56:35,379 --> 00:56:38,413
Wow. Look at that.

1261
00:56:38,517 --> 00:56:39,689
Sabiyah's on the grill.

1262
00:56:39,793 --> 00:56:42,172
It is a survivor cook out.

1263
00:56:42,275 --> 00:56:44,034
Machete, I felt like,

1264
00:56:44,137 --> 00:56:45,586
is kind of built
for this, right?

1265
00:56:45,689 --> 00:56:47,241
It's like a spatula almost.

1266
00:56:50,413 --> 00:56:51,655
It's working.

1267
00:56:51,758 --> 00:56:53,103
So, Emily,

1268
00:56:53,206 --> 00:56:56,068
at the end of today's
challenge, you were frustrated.

1269
00:56:56,172 --> 00:56:59,655
What part of that carried over
when you got back to your camp?

1270
00:56:59,758 --> 00:57:02,275
Yeah, it was frustrating
because I know it's my game line.

1271
00:57:02,379 --> 00:57:04,493
So, me failing in the calling
position, the rest of the team

1272
00:57:04,517 --> 00:57:06,758
failing in the puzzle
position felt like

1273
00:57:06,862 --> 00:57:09,655
this stamp at the end of
my game of survivor, right?

1274
00:57:09,758 --> 00:57:11,803
And so, coming back to camp,
we did what we always do,

1275
00:57:11,827 --> 00:57:14,586
which was scrambled. And
is my brain now scrambled?

1276
00:57:14,689 --> 00:57:16,448
- Yes, it is.
- It sounded like

1277
00:57:16,551 --> 00:57:18,965
you were talking past
tense, that you feel

1278
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:20,562
the stamp is done,
that you're going home.

1279
00:57:20,586 --> 00:57:22,862
First tribal council
we were at, Jeff, I said,

1280
00:57:22,965 --> 00:57:25,379
"look, these three are
clearly working together.

1281
00:57:25,482 --> 00:57:27,310
They're very strong together."

1282
00:57:27,413 --> 00:57:28,734
And so, yeah, I've
done everything

1283
00:57:28,758 --> 00:57:30,241
in my power today,
but ultimately,

1284
00:57:30,344 --> 00:57:32,784
I'm not the person who's writing
down everybody else's votes.

1285
00:57:32,862 --> 00:57:36,000
Sabiyah, is Emily
close to being right

1286
00:57:36,103 --> 00:57:39,103
that she still feels on the
outside of the three of you?

1287
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:41,103
I think so.

1288
00:57:41,206 --> 00:57:42,793
I mean, I feel like anybody

1289
00:57:42,896 --> 00:57:45,620
that would take such
harsh jabs early

1290
00:57:45,724 --> 00:57:48,965
I mean, she was coming at
me, she was coming at Kaleb.

1291
00:57:49,068 --> 00:57:51,172
Of course it lingers in
the back of your mind,

1292
00:57:51,275 --> 00:57:54,034
especially when you
have other teammates

1293
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,448
that have never said your
name in a conversation

1294
00:57:56,551 --> 00:57:58,344
about going home.

1295
00:58:06,379 --> 00:58:09,206
Might be about that time.

1296
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:10,862
Looks like the wax is gone.

1297
00:58:11,827 --> 00:58:13,482
Canteen?

1298
00:58:13,586 --> 00:58:15,389
- Throw it right here, okay? On the ground.
- Okay.

1299
00:58:15,413 --> 00:58:18,000
This is an entire operation.

1300
00:58:19,689 --> 00:58:21,724
Gonna leave it for a bit.

1301
00:58:23,965 --> 00:58:26,000
So what is it you're
kicking over? It's dark.

1302
00:58:26,103 --> 00:58:29,793
Looks like we have
some type of scroll,

1303
00:58:29,896 --> 00:58:31,389
but I'm gonna let it
cool out for a little bit,

1304
00:58:31,413 --> 00:58:32,758
just for safety.

1305
00:58:35,931 --> 00:58:38,103
All right, so, Kaleb, was there

1306
00:58:38,206 --> 00:58:41,965
a conversation or was
this an afternoon where

1307
00:58:42,068 --> 00:58:45,655
the three of you said,
"this is easy... it's Emily"?

1308
00:58:45,758 --> 00:58:48,000
You know Emily is not
gonna just say, "hey, guys,

1309
00:58:48,103 --> 00:58:49,586
you know, it's been a pleasure."

1310
00:58:49,689 --> 00:58:52,620
She wanted to meet with all of
us, she wanted to make plans.

1311
00:58:52,724 --> 00:58:54,862
I would say the fear
in my shoes is that

1312
00:58:54,965 --> 00:58:56,862
she would paint me as a target.

1313
00:58:56,965 --> 00:58:59,482
- How about you, sabiyah?
- What's your fear

1314
00:58:59,586 --> 00:59:01,724
that Emily might have done
today behind your back?

1315
00:59:01,827 --> 00:59:03,241
I would say a lot of the same.

1316
00:59:03,344 --> 00:59:05,862
I mean, she's been left
out of a lot of situations.

1317
00:59:05,965 --> 00:59:08,125
Even with the idol. She
just found out about it today.

1318
00:59:08,206 --> 00:59:11,172
So it could make her feel like,

1319
00:59:11,275 --> 00:59:12,689
"let me pull Kaleb and say,

1320
00:59:12,793 --> 00:59:14,458
'hey, sabiyah, you
know, she has an idol.'"

1321
00:59:14,482 --> 00:59:18,137
and, you know, Kaleb... he's
been my guy from the beginning.

1322
00:59:18,241 --> 00:59:21,137
We are perceived as a couple,
we are perceived as a pair.

1323
00:59:21,241 --> 00:59:24,827
And sometimes, that
could be good or bad.

1324
00:59:24,931 --> 00:59:26,827
And Jeff, survivor
is a game with a lot

1325
00:59:26,931 --> 00:59:29,724
of twists, swaps, advantages.

1326
00:59:29,827 --> 00:59:32,103
So, having the strongest core

1327
00:59:32,206 --> 00:59:34,034
is gonna be a
great thing because

1328
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:36,137
- anything could change tomorrow.
- So, sabiyah,

1329
00:59:36,241 --> 00:59:37,872
how are you feeling
about your idol right now?

1330
00:59:37,896 --> 00:59:39,896
- It's cooled down.
- It's cooled off.

1331
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,689
Yeah, I'm feeling
pretty good about it.

1332
00:59:41,793 --> 00:59:43,448
I can't wait to
see what's inside.

1333
00:59:44,655 --> 00:59:48,068
All right, well, sabiyah
has her idol. It is cooled.

1334
00:59:48,172 --> 00:59:51,655
It's in her pocket
and it is time to vote.

1335
00:59:51,758 --> 00:59:53,275
Emily, you're up.

1336
01:00:22,689 --> 01:00:24,206
Okay.

1337
01:00:51,413 --> 01:00:53,137
Okay.

1338
01:00:53,241 --> 01:00:58,206
I know that Emily and
Sean are voting Kaleb,

1339
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:00,413
and Kaleb voted Emily.

1340
01:01:00,517 --> 01:01:03,689
So, if I don't vote,

1341
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:08,620
I get the idol until the
merge, which is huge.

1342
01:01:08,724 --> 01:01:11,379
My god. Y'all are killing me.

1343
01:01:21,206 --> 01:01:23,344
I'll go tally the votes.

1344
01:01:34,793 --> 01:01:37,344
If anybody has an
advantage or an idol

1345
01:01:37,448 --> 01:01:40,931
and you want to play it, now
would be the time to do so.

1346
01:01:43,931 --> 01:01:45,655
Y'all good?

1347
01:01:45,758 --> 01:01:46,896
I'm good.

1348
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,931
- I'm good.
- Yeah.

1349
01:01:51,068 --> 01:01:52,655
All right, I'll read the votes.

1350
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,413
First vote:

1351
01:01:59,517 --> 01:02:01,344
Sabiyah.

1352
01:02:07,034 --> 01:02:09,724
Kaleb.

1353
01:02:09,827 --> 01:02:11,655
One vote sabiyah,
one vote Kaleb.

1354
01:02:12,827 --> 01:02:15,206
One vote left.

1355
01:02:19,206 --> 01:02:22,862
Third person voted
out of survivor45...

1356
01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:26,965
Sabiyah.

1357
01:02:27,068 --> 01:02:28,931
That's two. That's enough.

1358
01:02:29,034 --> 01:02:30,758
You need to bring me your torch.

1359
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,206
- Wow.
- Wow.

1360
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:36,034
That's wild.

1361
01:02:43,172 --> 01:02:45,113
Well, I didn't think I'd
be here this early, Jeff.

1362
01:02:45,137 --> 01:02:46,448
I'm not gonna lie.

1363
01:02:46,551 --> 01:02:49,068
Sabiyah, the tribe has spoken.

1364
01:02:53,034 --> 01:02:57,137
- Who?
- Lulu!

1365
01:02:57,241 --> 01:02:58,976
- We love you, sabiyah.
- Love you, sabiyah.

01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,275
Way to rock it.

1367
01:03:07,137 --> 01:03:09,137
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp.

1368
01:03:09,241 --> 01:03:12,275
Good night.

Everybody drop your buffs.

1372
01:03:31,137 --> 01:03:32,379
We are switching tribes.

1373
01:03:32,482 --> 01:03:34,896
This is music to a girl's ears.

1374
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Next time on survivor...

1375
01:03:37,103 --> 01:03:38,320
Now we're starting
to build new memories

1376
01:03:38,344 --> 01:03:39,551
and back stab each other.

1377
01:03:39,655 --> 01:03:41,965
We got to pivot and
we have to play now.

1378
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:43,379
I got to be ready to jump ship.

1379
01:03:43,482 --> 01:03:45,965
Thank god I'm a good swimmer.

1380
01:03:50,482 --> 01:03:52,148
I didn't vote because I
just didn't think I needed to.

1381
01:03:52,172 --> 01:03:54,241
I mean, after all the
conversations that I had,

1382
01:03:54,344 --> 01:03:56,586
I was sure it was Kaleb
going home tonight.

1383
01:03:56,689 --> 01:03:59,241
But, um, even though,
you know, I got blindsided,

1384
01:03:59,344 --> 01:04:00,724
you blindside the best players.

1385
01:04:00,827 --> 01:04:02,700
You blindside the people
that you're afraid of.

1386
01:04:02,724 --> 01:04:04,320
So it's good to know
that they were scared,

1387
01:04:04,344 --> 01:04:06,413
and they did what
they had to do.

1388
01:04:06,517 --> 01:04:08,931
So, they got me
tonight, I'm not gonna lie.
