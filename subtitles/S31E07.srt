00:00:01,538 --> 00:00:03,931
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:04,562 --> 00:00:07,215
Welcome to
Second Chance Survivor!

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,909
16 days ago, 20 former players

5
00:00:10,034 --> 00:00:12,992
were getting their second chance
at a game they love.

6
00:00:13,117 --> 00:00:15,030
I have to go through it all again.

7
00:00:15,155 --> 00:00:16,716
I come looking for redemption.

8
00:00:18,116 --> 00:00:20,895
And all of them brought
their past with them.

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,165
I feel like the last time:
out of place in my tribe.

10
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,675
Fishbach, a fish out of water,
once again!

11
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:29,604
Some even had
a common history.

12
00:00:29,854 --> 00:00:32,173
Kass, zero chance of winning the game!

13
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:35,134
Kass and I had a fight,
and we even hated each other.

14
00:00:35,426 --> 00:00:37,236
And with redemption at stake,

15
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:39,705
it was clear
that everyone would play hard...

16
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,072
...and quick.

17
00:00:42,197 --> 00:00:44,343
When it merges, it will be the apocalypse.

18
00:00:44,602 --> 00:00:47,180
The Bayon tribe
decided to stick together.

19
00:00:47,305 --> 00:00:49,150
We have the strongest group.

20
00:00:49,275 --> 00:00:50,925
We can move forward in the game.

21
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,199
We have to stick together
and support each other.

22
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:55,388
But after a surprise mix...

23
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:58,558
We go from two tribes...
to three.

24
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:01,536
No kidding !

25
00:01:01,894 --> 00:01:04,963
The ex-Bayon
had to conclude new agreements.

26
00:01:05,088 --> 00:01:06,355
This is the final quintet.

27
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,950
I try to recruit
as many people as possible.

28
00:01:09,355 --> 00:01:11,946
Everyone was shocked
when Terry left the game.

29
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:14,315
Your son is in the hospital.

30
00:01:14,632 --> 00:01:17,785
But they were even more surprised
by a second mix.

31
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,245
There will be two tribes.

32
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,955
Ta Keo and Bayon.

33
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,305
I'm excited.
I just want to win.

34
00:01:24,378 --> 00:01:26,858
The new Bayon
proved to be the strongest tribe.

35
00:01:26,983 --> 00:01:28,154
Damn, yeah!

36
00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:30,656
And they won
the final immunity challenge.

37
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:32,558
Bayon wins immunity!

38
00:01:32,773 --> 00:01:34,168
In the new Ta Keo,

39
00:01:34,293 --> 00:01:35,928
Spencer was on the sidelines.

40
00:01:36,053 --> 00:01:38,464
Tonight, everyone votes for Spencer.
I am not joking.

41
00:01:38,589 --> 00:01:41,676
But Spencer and Kass
forgot their past differences.

42
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:44,445
No one will expect us
to work together.

43
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,339
I didn't want to play with Spencer.

44
00:01:46,464 --> 00:01:48,513
But can it be useful to me,
at this moment?

45
00:01:48,638 --> 00:01:51,477
And at the council, Kass saved Spencer,

46
00:01:51,602 --> 00:01:55,381
knocking out Woo by surprise
and shocking Wiglesworth and Savage.

47
00:01:55,738 --> 00:01:57,392
Surprise elimination!

48
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:58,949
The tribe has spoken.

49
00:01:59,178 --> 00:02:00,383
There are 13 left.

50
00:02:00,508 --> 00:02:02,556
Who will be eliminated tonight?

51
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,222
What's great
about Second Chance,

52
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:22,932
is that there are so
many levels of relationships,

53
00:02:23,474 --> 00:02:26,287
that even if you say start from scratch,

54
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:30,016
you find yourself with someone
who may have betrayed you in the past...

55
00:02:30,605 --> 00:02:31,774
Rough evening.

56
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:35,054
At the council, I thought everything was locked.
They kept me away.

57
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:38,917
They are incredible liars.

58
00:02:39,572 --> 00:02:42,136
I thought I was good
at deciphering people...

59
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:44,721
They are pros.

60
00:02:44,846 --> 00:02:46,474
These people are pros.

61
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,098
Believe that if you were...

62
00:02:49,223 --> 00:02:52,357
You didn't have to come see me,
but if you did,

63
00:02:52,482 --> 00:02:55,249
I would have just said,
"Okay, I understand."

64
00:02:55,374 --> 00:02:57,659
It was nothing personal
against anyone.

65
00:02:57,784 --> 00:02:59,980
It was purely related
to the red flags.

66
00:03:01,227 --> 00:03:03,514
I especially feel betrayed by Kass.

67
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,927
I thought she was
firmly linked to the Bayon.

68
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:08,016
But after last night,

69
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,164
she became a Ta Keo.

70
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:12,957
I will not go without a fight.

71
00:03:14,101 --> 00:03:15,526
Fuck them!

72
00:03:16,115 --> 00:03:17,506
Band motherfuckers !

73
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,871
I have a big heart and I am loyal.

74
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:27,949
And I have supported you
from day 1.

75
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,542
All I'm saying is:

76
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,219
take me to merge

77
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,140
and use me from here.

78
00:03:33,265 --> 00:03:34,662
A merger is coming.

79
00:03:34,787 --> 00:03:36,691
If I have to lay low,

80
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:39,884
act like
a funky little follower,

81
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,351
the kind to go unnoticed,

82
00:03:42,476 --> 00:03:45,199
what is opposite to me,
I will do.

83
00:03:45,324 --> 00:03:46,801
I have to reach fusion.

84
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,274
We are all on the same
wavelength, we want to win.

85
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:53,665
Do you promise
not to take it out on me again?

86
00:03:54,096 --> 00:03:55,877
I will not rewrite your name.

87
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,046
I swear.

88
00:03:57,171 --> 00:04:00,214
Savage feels stupid and guilty,

89
00:04:00,464 --> 00:04:04,152
because he was caught
red-handed trying to eliminate me by surprise.

90
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,222
But I'll have to make peace,

91
00:04:06,347 --> 00:04:10,459
because I create relationships,
this time, that saved me.

92
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,461
It took 17 days,
but I finally have a band.

93
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,868
Maybe this is the start

94
00:04:14,993 --> 00:04:16,849
of what should have happened
in Cagayan.

95
00:04:16,974 --> 00:04:18,721
- And it's a second chance.
- But yes.

96
00:04:18,846 --> 00:04:21,648
Kass and I fought a lot
in Cagayan.

97
00:04:21,773 --> 00:04:24,650
But this time,
I have to rely on her.

98
00:04:25,225 --> 00:04:27,476
I really changed
and progressed in this game,

99
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,202
hence my presence today.

100
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,826
Hear, hear!

101
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:37,475
Princes and princesses!

102
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,993
No bamboo or anything.
Just one page.

103
00:04:40,118 --> 00:04:41,289
Brief and concise.

104
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,391
"Bayon tribe..."
That's us.

105
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:47,421
"...Go to the end of your beach
and wait for visitors."

106
00:04:47,546 --> 00:04:48,906
- What ?
- Not possible !

107
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:51,679
- Fusion ?
- A merger at 13?

108
00:04:51,804 --> 00:04:53,578
I'm a Survivor fan.

109
00:04:53,703 --> 00:04:55,561
So soon,
it can't be fusion.

110
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:57,839
Usually there are 9 or 10 people.

111
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,665
They won't come
to this shithole?!

112
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,335
If it's the merger,

113
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,837
the Intelligence tribe of Cagayan

114
00:05:04,962 --> 00:05:06,223
will be met.

115
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,416
Kass, Spencer and me.

116
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,710
We have a good history
of collaboration.

117
00:05:10,835 --> 00:05:12,708
But it hasn't always been rosy.

118
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,733
So I'm very nervous.

119
00:05:16,606 --> 00:05:17,739
"Tribu Ta Keo.

120
00:05:17,864 --> 00:05:19,527
Gather all the stuff

121
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,612
that you want to keep
for the future

122
00:05:21,737 --> 00:05:24,590
and follow that map
to your new home."

123
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:25,767
Quoi ?!

124
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,836
What does fusion mean?
It makes me really nervous.

125
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:31,631
With Savage, who is very disappointed,
who was lied to...

126
00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:35,059
Going to merge
with someone like that worries me.

127
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:36,776
What do you think is going on?

128
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:38,813
I don't know,
but we have to stick together.

129
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,641
Remember: someone out there
will feel like they're at the bottom of the ladder.

130
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:43,431
- Find the flaw!
- Exactly.

131
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:44,877
That this surprise

132
00:05:45,002 --> 00:05:46,628
turns out to be wonderful!

133
00:05:46,753 --> 00:05:48,181
A wonderful fusion!

134
00:05:48,675 --> 00:05:50,575
I dreamed of achieving fusion.

135
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:52,475
I suffered.

136
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:56,297
I pray to the Survivor gods
with all my might

137
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:58,610
that today brings something positive,
like the merger,

138
00:05:58,735 --> 00:06:00,801
and find my Bayon brothers.

139
00:06:00,926 --> 00:06:02,503
Please !

140
00:06:41,698 --> 00:06:44,473
What's up, Ta Keo?!

141
00:06:48,761 --> 00:06:51,372
We cross the hill,
and suddenly I look,

142
00:06:51,497 --> 00:06:54,152
and I see this little Ta Keo tribe.

143
00:06:54,277 --> 00:06:55,278
More 13 ?

144
00:06:55,403 --> 00:06:57,722
No way it's the merger,
there are too many of us!

145
00:06:57,847 --> 00:06:59,090
Are we all there?

146
00:06:59,215 --> 00:07:01,618
- Go ahead, Keith!
- "Congratulations, you have merged!"

147
00:07:06,224 --> 00:07:07,231
Orange !

148
00:07:08,401 --> 00:07:10,551
Everyone's excited, but...

149
00:07:10,894 --> 00:07:13,063
We say to ourselves: "Oh, oh!
There are really a lot of us!"

150
00:07:13,188 --> 00:07:14,189
Ahead !

151
00:07:16,158 --> 00:07:18,636
When we reach fusion,
we know well

152
00:07:18,761 --> 00:07:20,170
that things will change.

153
00:07:20,295 --> 00:07:23,511
- Welcome back !
- I was tired of confronting you!

154
00:07:24,993 --> 00:07:27,296
- Glad to see you again!
- We've reached fusion!

155
00:07:27,421 --> 00:07:30,246
It's a new game, let's go!
We are like the 1st day.

156
00:07:30,371 --> 00:07:32,724
It's dangerous. But it's funny.

157
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:35,060
- To the merger!
- To the merger!

158
00:07:38,722 --> 00:07:40,719
To the 13 greatest losers
of all time!

159
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,834
Can we start unpacking?

160
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,824
Let's start unpacking, let's see.

161
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:47,505
I'm super excited.
But I'm freaking out.

162
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,692
I didn't reach fusion
last time,

163
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:51,111
that was my #1 goal.

164
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:53,109
So having done it this time,

165
00:07:53,234 --> 00:07:55,714
it is already a step accomplished.

166
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,021
Will you pass me the juice?

167
00:07:57,146 --> 00:08:00,452
But I want to fight my
way to the end.

168
00:08:00,577 --> 00:08:02,053
There is only one winner.

169
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:04,914
Only one person pockets the million
at the end of Survivor.

170
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,568
I came to play.

171
00:08:06,693 --> 00:08:09,886
- Woo was shocked?
- Woo was very shocked.

172
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,931
- So who voted for him?
-Spencer,

173
00:08:13,056 --> 00:08:14,791
as well as Wigles and Savage.

174
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,501
All voted Spencer.

175
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:18,829
What about you, Kass?
Did you vote for him?

176
00:08:18,954 --> 00:08:19,963
Non.

177
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,565
I worked with Spencer.

178
00:08:24,893 --> 00:08:27,879
In a strange twist,
he put his fate in my hands.

179
00:08:28,004 --> 00:08:29,439
And I didn't abuse it.

180
00:08:29,564 --> 00:08:30,982
That's crazy !

181
00:08:31,107 --> 00:08:32,550
Chaos-Kass, my saviour!

182
00:08:32,878 --> 00:08:36,226
Last night, I basically decided
to save Spencer.

183
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,224
I feel that he
really trusts me,

184
00:08:39,474 --> 00:08:41,927
because I supported
him and did not lie to him.

185
00:08:42,052 --> 00:08:44,054
Then I can play this card
with him.

186
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:45,964
I saved him.

187
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:48,366
I'm officially
in a food coma!

188
00:08:48,491 --> 00:08:51,127
The cheese is starting to weigh on me.

189
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:55,362
I was alert, ready to pounce.

190
00:08:55,487 --> 00:08:56,575
Because...

191
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,854
Everyone knew
that as soon as the feast was over,

192
00:09:00,103 --> 00:09:01,438
it would be chaos.

193
00:09:01,563 --> 00:09:03,202
I can't wait to talk to you.

194
00:09:03,327 --> 00:09:04,975
Are we staying super tight?

195
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,523
We have a lot to discuss.

196
00:09:06,648 --> 00:09:09,379
You have to be operational from the start,
in the new school Survivor.

197
00:09:09,504 --> 00:09:12,190
We must immediately
create an alliance of seven

198
00:09:12,315 --> 00:09:14,417
to be majority in the 1st vote.

199
00:09:17,614 --> 00:09:20,821
Sit in your hammock, bro!
Like the good old times.

200
00:09:20,946 --> 00:09:23,335
I am the happiest of men.

201
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,162
Back in my
original home, Bayon.

202
00:09:26,423 --> 00:09:29,502
Jeremy, last night's episode
scares me.

203
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:33,703
You can't imagine
how fast and stealthy they are.

204
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,388
It could have been me.

205
00:09:35,513 --> 00:09:38,062
Everything will happen very quickly.

206
00:09:38,675 --> 00:09:42,316
They might already have
six people against you and me,

207
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:43,880
without us even knowing it.

208
00:09:44,177 --> 00:09:47,291
The crux of the matter
is Bayon versus Ta Keo.

209
00:09:47,876 --> 00:09:49,427
We must be seven.

210
00:09:49,814 --> 00:09:51,257
So you, me,

211
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,323
Tasha...

212
00:09:53,448 --> 00:09:54,802
And Fishbach?

213
00:09:55,314 --> 00:09:56,872
Fishbach is with us.

214
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:58,028
Kimmi too.

215
00:09:58,153 --> 00:10:00,639
We could go to Wiglesworth.

216
00:10:00,764 --> 00:10:02,021
She is with us?

217
00:10:02,637 --> 00:10:03,745
That's six.

218
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,179
Wiglesworth told me
she would protect me.

219
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:08,371
She was not
in the original Bayon,

220
00:10:08,496 --> 00:10:10,940
but she is very loyal,
as far as I know.

221
00:10:11,065 --> 00:10:12,809
And we need seven people.

222
00:10:12,934 --> 00:10:14,634
From a numerical point of view,

223
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:18,323
I have to do everything to recruit Joe
to confirm

224
00:10:18,448 --> 00:10:20,592
that he wants to be part of the Bayon.

225
00:10:20,842 --> 00:10:23,196
What we will create today and tomorrow

226
00:10:23,321 --> 00:10:26,663
will lay the groundwork
for the next two weeks.

227
00:10:29,995 --> 00:10:31,937
- [???]
- Yeah.

228
00:10:32,187 --> 00:10:34,733
Jeremy, Savage and the others
are clearly together.

229
00:10:34,858 --> 00:10:37,358
- Who else can we recruit, Abi?
- Abi, it's okay.

230
00:10:37,483 --> 00:10:39,343
- I say.
- She can't win.

231
00:10:39,468 --> 00:10:41,323
Who else ?
We are missing someone.

232
00:10:41,448 --> 00:10:43,510
Right now, we have Spencer.

233
00:10:43,635 --> 00:10:45,041
- Good.
- And it's strange.

234
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:48,266
We are five,
with Abi and Spencer, it's good.

235
00:10:48,391 --> 00:10:50,113
For now, I'm working

236
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,523
with Kass,

237
00:10:51,648 --> 00:10:52,716
Ciera,

238
00:10:52,841 --> 00:10:53,850
Keith,

239
00:10:53,975 --> 00:10:55,894
and we hope to have Joe.

240
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:58,430
Because on the former Ta Keo camp,

241
00:10:58,555 --> 00:11:00,227
we had a final quintet chord.

242
00:11:00,352 --> 00:11:01,381
So it's good.

243
00:11:01,506 --> 00:11:03,535
According to Kass, we have Abi,

244
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:06,241
but then there's Spencer and Joe,

245
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:08,440
which are a bit like free electrons.

246
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:12,258
I want to talk to them to see
where exactly they are.

247
00:11:12,383 --> 00:11:14,638
To make sure they're in.

248
00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:17,707
It is now clear
that Spencer and Joe

249
00:11:17,832 --> 00:11:20,486
are going to have weight
and control over this game.

250
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:21,645
Everything is here.

251
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,066
It is crucial.

252
00:11:45,027 --> 00:11:46,935
I was doing my math last night

253
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,831
and I realized the importance
of reconnecting with Joe,

254
00:11:50,956 --> 00:11:52,283
between four eyes,

255
00:11:52,408 --> 00:11:55,463
to confirm
the strength of our bond,

256
00:11:55,588 --> 00:11:57,109
because we need him.

257
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:00,391
My speech today is:
"We can do it.

258
00:12:00,516 --> 00:12:03,419
Let's stick together, we have the majority.
It is very simple."

259
00:12:03,661 --> 00:12:05,996
On a nos Bayon.

260
00:12:06,531 --> 00:12:08,357
That brings us to day 30.

261
00:12:09,157 --> 00:12:10,857
If everyone is.

262
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,997
So, let's review the list.

263
00:12:14,587 --> 00:12:15,798
I have both of us

264
00:12:16,281 --> 00:12:17,708
Jeremy, Tasha,

265
00:12:18,213 --> 00:12:19,243
Kimmi,

266
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:21,315
Stephen et Wiglesworth.

267
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:23,372
We have the old Bayon.

268
00:12:23,497 --> 00:12:24,782
Honestly,

269
00:12:24,907 --> 00:12:27,476
we reach the 30th day,
and then we will advise.

270
00:12:27,898 --> 00:12:30,458
Savage puts his heart
into the game,

271
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,489
and he actually opens it.

272
00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:36,160
I think I can trust him,

273
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:38,354
but I had a plan with the Ta Keos,

274
00:12:38,664 --> 00:12:41,398
so I don't close any doors.

275
00:12:41,648 --> 00:12:44,201
I'll talk to everyone,
take the temperature.

276
00:12:49,475 --> 00:12:50,663
Tell me, Spencer.

277
00:12:50,788 --> 00:12:52,568
You look concerned.

278
00:12:52,693 --> 00:12:54,926
There are 13 people,
you seem to be saying:

279
00:12:55,051 --> 00:12:56,395
"I can not do it."

280
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,351
I'm having a little trouble
understanding everything that's going on.

281
00:13:00,476 --> 00:13:03,162
I hadn't seen Spencer
in quite a while.

282
00:13:03,287 --> 00:13:05,381
I wanted to reconnect
and make sure

283
00:13:05,506 --> 00:13:07,349
that he was ready
to work with me.

284
00:13:07,474 --> 00:13:09,793
Who do you want to play with?

285
00:13:09,918 --> 00:13:12,087
In view of the two groups,
I trust...

286
00:13:13,095 --> 00:13:14,698
to Kass, Ciera, you,

287
00:13:14,823 --> 00:13:16,439
and even Abi.

288
00:13:16,564 --> 00:13:18,982
I have more confidence in this group

289
00:13:19,107 --> 00:13:21,330
than in Tasha and Savage.
Does it speak to you?

290
00:13:21,455 --> 00:13:24,295
The only two I doubt

291
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,841
because I haven't spoken to them,
it's Joe and Keith.

292
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:29,013
Keith, it's 100%.

293
00:13:29,138 --> 00:13:30,514
I promise you.

294
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,661
- You think ?
- Absolutely.

295
00:13:32,786 --> 00:13:33,942
It is enormous.

296
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:35,071
And Joe?

297
00:13:35,196 --> 00:13:37,354
I have to talk to him

298
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:39,308
to take the temperature

299
00:13:39,433 --> 00:13:42,153
and make sure he doesn't
befriend Jeremy and Savage.

300
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:44,420
For now,
there are two rival groups.

301
00:13:44,628 --> 00:13:48,265
Apparently Joe and I
are right in the middle.

302
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,659
I wouldn't mind
staying with Joe,

303
00:13:50,784 --> 00:13:52,331
to associate myself with him,

304
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,631
maybe even set up a stunt
with him later.

305
00:13:56,093 --> 00:13:59,938
I had no allies
for more than a day.

306
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:02,547
- It sucks.
- Yeah.

307
00:14:02,672 --> 00:14:06,475
Me, I did not go to the council,
so my confidence remains to be tested.

308
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,811
- Just.
- I don't know where the people are.

309
00:14:08,936 --> 00:14:11,179
There is clearly a Bayon group.

310
00:14:11,304 --> 00:14:13,115
There's Jeremy...

311
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,168
- Jeremy, Tash.
- Tash, Stephen.

312
00:14:16,293 --> 00:14:19,855
Joe and I were discussing alliances.

313
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,467
I tried to put that
in Joe's language.

314
00:14:23,717 --> 00:14:25,838
"Well, Joe, it's like football.

315
00:14:25,963 --> 00:14:28,161
Here is the field.

316
00:14:28,286 --> 00:14:31,100
If this person,
this one and this one..."

317
00:14:31,225 --> 00:14:35,112
I think there's a quintet here
and another one there.

318
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:38,015
Basically, we're in the middle.

319
00:14:38,265 --> 00:14:40,750
At this point there is a line,

320
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,087
and I'm on one side
or the other, with you.

321
00:14:43,212 --> 00:14:45,289
We have to protect each other.

322
00:15:06,577 --> 00:15:08,097
I feel like I'm being punished.

323
00:15:08,404 --> 00:15:10,481
It's a rainy day
and I have to pass it

324
00:15:10,606 --> 00:15:12,283
in Grandma's sewing room.

325
00:15:12,408 --> 00:15:13,828
And stay calm.

326
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,812
I have a poem to share with you.

327
00:15:18,144 --> 00:15:19,848
It is called "Greatness of God",

328
00:15:19,973 --> 00:15:21,817
par Gerard Manley Hopkins.

329
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,795
“The world is full
of the greatness of God.

330
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,149
She comes to spring forth,
sudden gleam of gold leaf,

331
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:31,593
Ample it piles up
like pressed oil squirts.

332
00:15:31,976 --> 00:15:34,643
Why do we laugh at his strength?

333
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,374
And yet nature
never runs out.

334
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:39,868
At the heart of things
lives sweet freshness.

335
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,047
Because the Holy Spirit covers the world

336
00:15:43,297 --> 00:15:46,917
with a lively breast and ah!
the brilliance of its wings.

337
00:15:47,435 --> 00:15:48,438
Attractive.

338
00:15:48,913 --> 00:15:50,988
- Very pretty.
- Very pretty.

339
00:15:51,113 --> 00:15:53,257
You should do this for us
every day.

340
00:15:53,382 --> 00:15:55,779
- Another 18!
- Fishbach's poem of the day!

341
00:15:55,904 --> 00:15:57,753
There's a thing between guys

342
00:15:57,878 --> 00:16:00,055
at the Bayons.
They are all together.

343
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,257
I think I have the most links,

344
00:16:02,607 --> 00:16:07,204
have the best chance
of gathering a majority to confront

345
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:10,674
Savage's clan, Jeremy and Stephen.

346
00:16:11,998 --> 00:16:14,903
This game has changed a lot
since the beginning.

347
00:16:15,028 --> 00:16:17,696
- There is a lot of people.
- Difficult to monitor them.

348
00:16:18,755 --> 00:16:22,634
And with all the mixing
things get really murky.

349
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,076
There is a division.

350
00:16:25,481 --> 00:16:28,150
If so,
you could be targeted, because you're...

351
00:16:28,682 --> 00:16:30,362
formidable in trials.

352
00:16:30,487 --> 00:16:34,589
I'm not... Everyone here
is formidable in trials.

353
00:16:34,825 --> 00:16:36,571
I spoke with Kass,

354
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:39,228
and I had the impression
that she was looking for information.

355
00:16:39,353 --> 00:16:42,840
But I know
she works with Ta Keo,

356
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:45,676
so I preferred to give him
a canard about my wedding ring.

357
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:48,846
The Bayon are not soldered.
It is one of the elements.

358
00:16:48,971 --> 00:16:50,439
You are close to Jeremy.

359
00:16:50,775 --> 00:16:52,641
But not Stephen.

360
00:16:52,766 --> 00:16:54,485
So Bayon, is it over?

361
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,176
That's what I would say.

362
00:16:56,431 --> 00:17:01,101
Kass caused my departure
during my first participation.

363
00:17:01,226 --> 00:17:03,538
I trusted her,
and what did she do?

364
00:17:03,663 --> 00:17:04,762
She betrayed me.

365
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:06,126
It's my 2nd chance.

366
00:17:06,251 --> 00:17:10,459
No way to give him
another chance to ruin my game.

367
00:17:10,755 --> 00:17:13,283
So what's your plan?
The Bayons in force?

368
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,279
My daughter...

369
00:17:15,404 --> 00:17:16,957
at this stage...

370
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:18,676
I have the impression...

371
00:17:18,801 --> 00:17:21,337
...that I will follow the advice of the group.

372
00:17:21,462 --> 00:17:24,381
I wanted to talk to Tasha,
and I was telling the truth,

373
00:17:24,506 --> 00:17:26,442
but it was not reciprocated.

374
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:29,504
It was very clear.
She never trusted me.

375
00:17:29,629 --> 00:17:31,280
She's stuck on Cagayan.

376
00:17:31,405 --> 00:17:32,950
It's our second chance.

377
00:17:33,075 --> 00:17:34,441
It all happens there.

378
00:17:34,566 --> 00:17:36,694
Don't get in the way of my 2nd chance!

379
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:38,620
You just unleashed the beast.

380
00:17:38,745 --> 00:17:40,894
The dividing lines
will appear today.

381
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,967
- You think ?
- In effect.

382
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,040
Bonjour !

383
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:03,317
Bonjour !

384
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:06,153
I know Tasha
can be explosive.

385
00:18:06,278 --> 00:18:08,213
And I'm ready to fight it out.

386
00:18:08,743 --> 00:18:10,215
You saved my life.

387
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,616
Sleeping in the back?

388
00:18:11,741 --> 00:18:13,760
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

389
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,585
The original Bayon
will control the game

390
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:19,315
if nobody is ready
to turn everything upside down.

391
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,127
God, may Chaos-Kass
not do this!

392
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:26,807
- It went badly yesterday, didn't it?
- Yes.

393
00:18:27,057 --> 00:18:29,606
You told me...

394
00:18:31,135 --> 00:18:33,005
that the Bayons were over.

395
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,663
How could I say that
when that's all I got?

396
00:18:36,788 --> 00:18:39,044
But I asked you to your face.
I said...

397
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:42,001
Kass, I won't tell you
what I really think,

398
00:18:42,126 --> 00:18:43,698
because I don't trust you.

399
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:48,816
So, whether you believe
this was a real conversation...

400
00:18:49,388 --> 00:18:51,952
It's the old Tasha.
Didn't you learn?

401
00:18:52,077 --> 00:18:55,095
I'm just saying...
Yes. I learned.

402
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,044
I learned
not to trust you.

403
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,630
That's what I picked up.

404
00:18:58,755 --> 00:19:01,014
Tasha instilled doubts.

405
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:03,078
It wasn't smart of him.

406
00:19:03,203 --> 00:19:04,936
She gave me food for thought.

407
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,048
I could tell all her allies
that she said to me:

408
00:19:08,298 --> 00:19:09,574
"Bye-bye, Bayon !"

409
00:19:09,699 --> 00:19:12,711
That's the thing. You told me
everything I needed.

410
00:19:12,836 --> 00:19:15,407
Here is the limit. It is drawn.

411
00:19:17,442 --> 00:19:18,700
The game is started.

412
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,268
I want to win Second Chance,

413
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:24,289
and if I have to use Chaos-Kass,
I will.

414
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,392
I spoke with Kass.

415
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,436
To make it clear,

416
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:31,071
You took me away yesterday

417
00:19:31,196 --> 00:19:32,806
and told a canard:

418
00:19:32,931 --> 00:19:34,132
"Bayon, it's over."

419
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:35,867
I did not say...

420
00:19:35,992 --> 00:19:37,440
How could I say that?

421
00:19:37,565 --> 00:19:39,391
You just admitted it.

422
00:19:39,516 --> 00:19:41,848
How could I say
"bye-bye Bayon",

423
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:44,447
- while I am linked to Bayon?
- You just admitted it.

424
00:19:44,572 --> 00:19:47,079
Kass. Don't imagine
that I'm going to tell you the truth.

425
00:19:47,204 --> 00:19:49,556
You come with your liabilities.

426
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:51,177
If we start from scratch?

427
00:19:51,302 --> 00:19:53,093
Not when someone lies to me.

428
00:19:53,218 --> 00:19:54,252
Kass !

429
00:19:54,377 --> 00:19:57,331
Let people think
about their allies and their behavior.

430
00:19:57,456 --> 00:19:59,866
I vote Tasha.
Because she doesn't trust me.

431
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,148
Tasha arrives with Kass,

432
00:20:02,273 --> 00:20:04,277
creating chaos on the camp,

433
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:06,773
accusing some
of betraying others.

434
00:20:07,023 --> 00:20:09,094
But I can use this.

435
00:20:09,219 --> 00:20:12,030
There is clearly
a strong group, Bayon.

436
00:20:12,155 --> 00:20:15,082
I wanted to instill doubt
to separate them.

437
00:20:15,207 --> 00:20:17,042
Let's lie to them
and see what happens.

438
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:20,127
We have seen Savage
become very close to Woo.

439
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:23,515
They told Kass and me
that you were a serious threat.

440
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,645
So, Woo and Savage

441
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:28,253
agreed
to go after Jeremy.

442
00:20:28,378 --> 00:20:30,130
- Nope.
- This is a lie.

443
00:20:30,255 --> 00:20:33,828
It was a comment
made by Woo and Savage,

444
00:20:33,953 --> 00:20:36,987
like what at the merger,
some big guys should leave.

445
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:38,892
And Joe and you were part of it.

446
00:20:39,017 --> 00:20:41,174
Tasha and Kass were arguing.

447
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:43,577
And suddenly,
Ciera pulls out something about me.

448
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:45,837
You just woke up
an angry bull!

449
00:20:45,962 --> 00:20:47,806
I never mentioned
Jeremy or Joe,

450
00:20:48,189 --> 00:20:51,423
and I would never take it out on them,

451
00:20:51,548 --> 00:20:53,945
so don't give that impression,
don't lie.

452
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,630
I do not lie. I will not back down
from what has been said.

453
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:00,399
We have a nasty raging
two-headed dragon

454
00:21:00,524 --> 00:21:02,871
who is wreaking havoc
on our beautiful little tribe.

455
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:05,732
We're gonna cut off one of those heads.

456
00:21:17,178 --> 00:21:18,946
Over here, everyone!

457
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:29,234
Ciera, tell me about the merger.

458
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:30,561
How was it ?

459
00:21:30,686 --> 00:21:33,577
With all the chaos
and talk about camp,

460
00:21:33,702 --> 00:21:35,987
we do not yet know
what to expect.

461
00:21:36,112 --> 00:21:38,023
We will be fixed at the first council,

462
00:21:38,148 --> 00:21:41,235
so it's a very good time
to wear the necklace.

463
00:21:41,485 --> 00:21:44,671
Ready for your first
individual immunity test?

464
00:21:44,796 --> 00:21:45,831
Oui !

465
00:21:45,956 --> 00:21:48,500
First of all, Ciera,
I'm taking back tribal immunity.

466
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:50,911
Merci.

467
00:21:53,283 --> 00:21:55,650
Tribal immunity is no more.

468
00:21:55,942 --> 00:22:00,087
Individual immunity
is what you are aiming for now.

469
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,414
Class!

470
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:03,882
He is splendid.

471
00:22:04,007 --> 00:22:06,510
And it will look great
around your neck.

472
00:22:06,635 --> 00:22:09,653
With that, you are safe from voting.
Without, you are vulnerable.

473
00:22:09,778 --> 00:22:11,658
- Are we coming to the test?
- Yes !

474
00:22:11,783 --> 00:22:12,791
Today,

475
00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:15,602
you will stand
on a narrow beam,

476
00:22:15,727 --> 00:22:18,320
while keeping a ball
balanced on a plate.

477
00:22:18,445 --> 00:22:19,640
Regularly,

478
00:22:19,765 --> 00:22:22,009
you will descend
to a narrower section

479
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:24,594
and your hand will descend
along the stake,

480
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,705
making the balance more precarious.

481
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,708
If you fall off the beam
or drop the ball,

482
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,488
the test is lost.

483
00:22:32,613 --> 00:22:34,212
The last person to hold

484
00:22:34,337 --> 00:22:36,500
wins immunity,
is immune from voting.

485
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,525
The losers will go to the council,

486
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,560
where someone will be
the 7th person eliminated from the game.

487
00:22:41,685 --> 00:22:45,740
This ordeal goes back to Smart
vs. Muscle vs. Beauty.

488
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:49,469
Spencer, Kass, Tasha,
all three disputed it.

489
00:22:49,594 --> 00:22:52,370
It ended up face-to-face
between Spencer and Tasha.

490
00:22:52,495 --> 00:22:54,085
Tasha won immunity.

491
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:57,844
So it's a second chance
for Spencer and Kass.

492
00:22:58,094 --> 00:23:00,614
We draw the places at random
and we start.

493
00:23:08,246 --> 00:23:09,314
Good.

494
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:11,058
Let's go.

495
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:13,927
Everyone places their ball
on their board.

496
00:23:14,503 --> 00:23:16,530
I'll count down from five.

497
00:23:16,965 --> 00:23:19,624
You have to remove your hand
before we get to one. Let's go.

498
00:23:20,457 --> 00:23:21,460
Five,

499
00:23:21,585 --> 00:23:23,756
four, three, two,

500
00:23:23,881 --> 00:23:24,882
and.

501
00:23:25,007 --> 00:23:26,707
Spread your hands.

502
00:23:26,832 --> 00:23:28,876
This test is on.

503
00:23:30,374 --> 00:23:33,203
It will be ten minutes per section,

504
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,647
for those who will hold on.

505
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,352
Stephen Fishbach, 1st eliminated.

506
00:23:38,477 --> 00:23:41,135
Take a seat on the bench.
There are 12 left, all at once.

507
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,681
After a few seconds,

508
00:23:42,806 --> 00:23:44,856
a first person loses.

509
00:23:46,828 --> 00:23:48,475
In this test,

510
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,583
stop thinking
about what you're doing,

511
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:53,308
even just for a moment,

512
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:56,410
will be enough to cause your loss.

513
00:24:07,465 --> 00:24:10,163
<font color=#00A295> ELAPSED TIME:
9 MINUTES

514
00:24:11,608 --> 00:24:13,721
Keith, lots of movement.

515
00:24:14,209 --> 00:24:16,059
- It's over for Keith.
- Damn !

516
00:24:16,184 --> 00:24:17,758
Keith rejoint Fishbach.

517
00:24:17,883 --> 00:24:19,683
Second person eliminated.

518
00:24:20,213 --> 00:24:22,113
Ciera, it's starting to move.

519
00:24:23,692 --> 00:24:25,023
Ciera does not hold.

520
00:24:25,148 --> 00:24:26,892
Third person eliminated.

521
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,420
Kimmi drops her ball.

522
00:24:31,673 --> 00:24:34,374
There are ten seconds left
in this round.

523
00:24:34,499 --> 00:24:36,368
We're almost there, hold on!

524
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:39,900
Five,

525
00:24:40,025 --> 00:24:41,106
four,

526
00:24:41,376 --> 00:24:42,382
three,

527
00:24:42,632 --> 00:24:43,639
of them,

528
00:24:43,764 --> 00:24:44,766
and.

529
00:24:44,891 --> 00:24:47,254
Get your hands on your ball,
you're safe.

530
00:24:48,605 --> 00:24:51,691
You will go down to the 2nd level,
narrower,

531
00:24:51,816 --> 00:24:53,493
and you will place your hands

532
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:55,495
lower on the stake.

533
00:24:56,551 --> 00:24:57,556
Good.

534
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,826
Let's go.

535
00:25:00,346 --> 00:25:01,355
Five,

536
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,045
four,

537
00:25:03,495 --> 00:25:04,500
three,

538
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,049
of them,

539
00:25:06,603 --> 00:25:07,608
and.

540
00:25:08,387 --> 00:25:11,340
Spread your hands. Here we go again.

541
00:25:12,838 --> 00:25:16,130
Abi is eliminated, after one second
in this 2nd round.

542
00:25:16,496 --> 00:25:20,012
You support more stake,
and the beam is narrower.

543
00:25:20,718 --> 00:25:24,768
Your room for maneuver is reduced,
in the 2 aspects of the event.

544
00:25:27,535 --> 00:25:30,127
Kass drops his ball.

545
00:25:30,408 --> 00:25:33,008
No 2nd chance redemption
for Kass.

546
00:25:38,061 --> 00:25:40,811
Suddenly,
Wiglesworth drops his ball.

547
00:25:41,516 --> 00:25:43,182
Wentworth drops his ball.

548
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:46,616
There are now
four men and one woman left,

549
00:25:46,989 --> 00:25:48,140
and this woman

550
00:25:48,265 --> 00:25:51,576
is the only person
to have ever won this event.

551
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,248
<font color=#00A295> ELAPSED TIME:
20 MINUTES

552
00:26:11,373 --> 00:26:14,408
There are 15 seconds left
in this section.

553
00:26:15,511 --> 00:26:16,643
Hold fast !

554
00:26:16,768 --> 00:26:18,670
Five, four,

555
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:20,372
three,

556
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:21,506
of them,

557
00:26:21,631 --> 00:26:22,637
and.

558
00:26:22,762 --> 00:26:26,386
Everyone is safe,
move on to the next section.

559
00:26:30,474 --> 00:26:32,826
Everyone is now
on the third section.

560
00:26:32,951 --> 00:26:34,351
I will count.

561
00:26:35,364 --> 00:26:36,368
Five,

562
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,661
four,

563
00:26:37,786 --> 00:26:38,790
three,

564
00:26:39,576 --> 00:26:40,581
of them,

565
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:42,018
and.

566
00:26:42,452 --> 00:26:44,544
This ordeal is over.

567
00:26:45,594 --> 00:26:48,244
- Lets go !
- Nice recovery from Savage.

568
00:26:48,967 --> 00:26:51,645
But it does not hold.
Savage is the first out.

569
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:52,898
There are four left.

570
00:26:53,023 --> 00:26:55,048
This section is very difficult.

571
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:58,910
Two beginners in this event,
Joe and Jeremy,

572
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:02,222
two veterans, the only ones
to have already competed in this event,

573
00:27:02,347 --> 00:27:03,523
Spencer et Tasha.

574
00:27:03,648 --> 00:27:05,250
Who will win today?

575
00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:10,399
Jeremy, on the edge,
but he's recovering well.

576
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:15,360
Nice recovery for Tasha.

577
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:18,038
Can she do it again?

578
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,240
Nope ! Tasha is eliminated.

579
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:27,879
Jeremy is eliminated,

580
00:27:28,004 --> 00:27:30,254
and now there are only two left.

581
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:32,482
Joe and Spencer.

582
00:27:32,787 --> 00:27:35,396
Big 2nd chance stake for Spencer.

583
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:39,126
He lost to Tasha the first time
this event was contested,

584
00:27:39,251 --> 00:27:41,285
in Intelligence, Muscles and Beauty.

585
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,730
Will he find redemption here,

586
00:27:44,137 --> 00:27:48,496
against one of the game's fiercest
competitors, Joe?

587
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:53,625
Spencer... wobbles.

588
00:27:54,027 --> 00:27:56,121
Nice recovery,
huge recovery!

589
00:27:56,246 --> 00:27:57,463
Will it hold?

590
00:27:58,646 --> 00:28:00,296
New recovery!

591
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:01,940
But it does not hold!

592
00:28:02,065 --> 00:28:03,308
Spencer falls!

593
00:28:03,579 --> 00:28:06,869
Joe wins
the first individual immunity!

594
00:28:08,745 --> 00:28:10,245
Congratulations, Joe!

595
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:12,823
Bravo, Spence !

596
00:28:20,113 --> 00:28:21,413
Joe, come here!

597
00:28:24,096 --> 00:28:25,120
He is so pretty!

598
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,950
- He is magnificent !
- Wonderful !

599
00:28:27,075 --> 00:28:29,305
First victory
in individual immunity.

600
00:28:29,831 --> 00:28:32,045
Safe from council vote tonight.

601
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,447
As for you others,

602
00:28:33,572 --> 00:28:37,384
after 19 days in
your 2nd chance adventure,

603
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:39,094
someone will fail.

604
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:41,593
You have the afternoon
to decide who it will be.

605
00:28:41,718 --> 00:28:44,259
Take your things, return to camp.
See you tonight at the council.

606
00:28:44,384 --> 00:28:45,775
- Congratulation.
- Thanks !

607
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,212
Big decision tonight.

608
00:28:47,337 --> 00:28:48,653
I'm in a position

609
00:28:48,778 --> 00:28:52,199
where Spencer and I
are pivot votes.

610
00:28:52,449 --> 00:28:56,570
I just know that I'm happy
to wear the necklace,

611
00:28:57,658 --> 00:28:59,506
because that's going to be great advice.

612
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:17,276
- Well done, Joe!
- Congratulation !

613
00:29:17,401 --> 00:29:18,918
Well done, my brother!

614
00:29:20,953 --> 00:29:22,152
Go on !

615
00:29:22,498 --> 00:29:24,596
First immunity.
I just wanted to win.

616
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,122
I wanted to assert myself.

617
00:29:26,247 --> 00:29:28,266
Looks like a gladiator!

618
00:29:28,716 --> 00:29:30,060
All these young stallions...

619
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,429
I wanted to show
that I could compete with them.

620
00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:35,699
Some try a new game,
others still live in the old one.

621
00:29:36,335 --> 00:29:38,944
But Kass and Ciera
did not win immunity.

622
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:41,898
In my season,
I never lied to anyone.

623
00:29:42,023 --> 00:29:44,005
And here,
I never lied to anyone.

624
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,742
The leader was Kass,

625
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,631
with Ciera behind.

626
00:29:47,756 --> 00:29:50,679
They invent
almost believable lies.

627
00:29:50,804 --> 00:29:53,091
That's what makes them so dangerous.

628
00:29:53,216 --> 00:29:55,679
But I'd rather Ciera leave.

629
00:29:55,804 --> 00:29:58,196
I will never forget
what she did.

630
00:29:58,321 --> 00:29:59,923
For me, that's the end of her.

631
00:30:01,791 --> 00:30:03,993
The decision seems easy, right?
After this morning.

632
00:30:04,118 --> 00:30:06,463
Frankly, I can't
trust Ciera.

633
00:30:06,588 --> 00:30:07,932
She's super dangerous.

634
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:11,046
She invents these lies
which are almost believable...

635
00:30:11,171 --> 00:30:13,879
That's it. They always contain
some truth.

636
00:30:14,004 --> 00:30:16,206
It wasn't the worst.
Kass was much worse.

637
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:19,339
They maintain each other.

638
00:30:19,464 --> 00:30:20,543
What do we do ?

639
00:30:20,668 --> 00:30:24,595
Kass seems to me the most disruptive.

640
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,334
For this vote,
I'd rather see Ciera go.

641
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:29,185
She is really dangerous.

642
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:32,122
To me, she's public enemy number one
and she needs to go.

643
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,899
I'm leaning towards Kass.

644
00:30:34,516 --> 00:30:36,001
It's unanimous.

645
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,227
At this stage,

646
00:30:37,352 --> 00:30:39,262
if the majority wants Kass,

647
00:30:39,387 --> 00:30:41,531
sometimes it is better to
follow the majority.

648
00:30:41,656 --> 00:30:46,127
Because Kass has a ruthless side
and his game is a bit random,

649
00:30:46,252 --> 00:30:47,270
and it scares me.

650
00:30:47,395 --> 00:30:49,345
So what is being said?

651
00:30:49,777 --> 00:30:51,483
For elimination?

652
00:30:52,824 --> 00:30:53,847
Well...

653
00:30:54,129 --> 00:30:58,124
Must be a troublemaker.

654
00:30:58,249 --> 00:30:59,250
Exact.

655
00:30:59,527 --> 00:31:01,531
- What do you think ?
- To Kass.

656
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:04,892
[???]

657
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:08,038
This is the shot to play.

658
00:31:08,163 --> 00:31:09,402
Kass ?

659
00:31:09,527 --> 00:31:10,989
No worries for me.

660
00:31:11,114 --> 00:31:13,305
I wondered
which way to go.

661
00:31:13,866 --> 00:31:16,032
But I feel that the majority

662
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:20,355
takes a certain direction
and won't wait for me.

663
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:24,529
Kass was the only one who wanted to
play with me in the last vote.

664
00:31:24,911 --> 00:31:27,652
Even if I want to save her,
I'm not sure I can.

665
00:31:27,777 --> 00:31:29,503
- Do we divide?
- I do not think so.

666
00:31:29,628 --> 00:31:30,945
Does Kass have an idol?

667
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,434
I do not think so.

668
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,627
Looks
like everyone is going to vote Kass.

669
00:31:35,752 --> 00:31:37,401
But Kass might have an idol.

670
00:31:37,526 --> 00:31:39,356
It's always good
to split the votes.

671
00:31:40,998 --> 00:31:43,502
- I know I vote for Kass.
- I vote for Kass.

672
00:31:43,962 --> 00:31:46,009
We're enough to get her out.

673
00:31:46,134 --> 00:31:48,084
Let's say she has an idol...

674
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:51,778
How to counter it?

675
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:53,879
It's a 4-5 split.

676
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:56,281
5 Kass, 4 Ciera.

677
00:31:56,406 --> 00:31:57,974
They will never see it coming.

678
00:31:58,099 --> 00:31:59,651
So 5 Kass, 4 Ciera.

679
00:31:59,776 --> 00:32:01,211
Sounds armored, right?

680
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,374
Yes, it is ideal.

681
00:32:04,499 --> 00:32:05,821
I don't like to say that

682
00:32:05,946 --> 00:32:08,084
but if they want to get Kass out,
I'm on it.

683
00:32:08,209 --> 00:32:10,359
She tends to mess things up.

684
00:32:10,484 --> 00:32:12,986
At this point, yeah, I lied: let
her go.

685
00:32:13,111 --> 00:32:15,600
We are clear on who is voting who?

686
00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:17,769
The reconciliation will happen.

687
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,445
It's so ugly to see.

688
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:23,669
What is this animal
that eats the dead,

689
00:32:23,794 --> 00:32:24,857
The vultures ?

690
00:32:24,982 --> 00:32:26,102
That's it ?

691
00:32:26,749 --> 00:32:28,543
Well, they... Never mind.

692
00:32:28,668 --> 00:32:30,138
I should have anticipated it.

693
00:32:30,263 --> 00:32:31,574
It started with Tasha.

694
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,449
Now I believe Keith
is going to follow the majority.

695
00:32:34,574 --> 00:32:36,780
Why are they talking
so long?

696
00:32:36,905 --> 00:32:39,549
They will split the votes. 5 - 4.

697
00:32:39,674 --> 00:32:41,584
If we had one more person...

698
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:44,964
They are in the majority
and could split the votes.

699
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:47,933
So if I had five people
ready to vote Tash,

700
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:49,225
Tasha would leave.

701
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,640
They divide.

702
00:32:50,765 --> 00:32:52,499
Vote Tasha and recruit Spencer.

703
00:32:52,624 --> 00:32:53,830
Five would be enough for me.

704
00:32:53,955 --> 00:32:55,699
- It's a split vote.
- OK.

705
00:32:55,824 --> 00:32:59,427
If we all vote Tasha, that means
anyone, anywhere,

706
00:32:59,552 --> 00:33:01,004
worth recruiting.

707
00:33:01,129 --> 00:33:03,931
If we get to Spencer in time,

708
00:33:04,056 --> 00:33:05,608
and it rolls with him,

709
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,296
we'll see what we'll see.

710
00:33:07,644 --> 00:33:09,096
As elders,

711
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:12,008
we know the votes
could be split.

712
00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:14,920
And after today's big
explosive argument,

713
00:33:15,045 --> 00:33:16,586
there is clearly a risk

714
00:33:16,711 --> 00:33:18,121
I'm leaving tonight.

715
00:33:19,507 --> 00:33:22,008
Ideally, I 'd love
Kass to be able to recruit Spencer,

716
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,594
that we can act
before it is too late.

717
00:33:24,941 --> 00:33:26,296
They split the votes.

718
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,170
If there's five of us, we can take Tasha out.

719
00:33:30,205 --> 00:33:31,225
Yeah.

720
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,104
Abi and Ciera are
in, and Wentworth said she would.

721
00:33:35,489 --> 00:33:37,839
- You all vote Tasha?
- Yeah.

722
00:33:38,806 --> 00:33:41,953
This is an opportunity to make a move
that would benefit both of us.

723
00:33:42,203 --> 00:33:44,623
I say.
And I know you got me covered.

724
00:33:44,873 --> 00:33:46,623
- So...
- Let's do it.

725
00:33:47,064 --> 00:33:51,129
Tonight the votes will be split
between Kass, Ciera and Tasha.

726
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:54,157
Today
it turned sour for no reason.

727
00:33:54,524 --> 00:33:55,959
It will be better after tonight.

728
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:59,337
My decision tonight
will determine who leaves.

729
00:33:59,587 --> 00:34:01,740
I always saw Tasha
as a friend.

730
00:34:01,865 --> 00:34:05,499
But Kass and Ciera
supported me and saved me.

731
00:34:05,624 --> 00:34:07,237
My luck has really changed.

732
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,639
I had never been in a position

733
00:34:09,764 --> 00:34:11,207
to influence the game.

734
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,559
For those
who don't have a torch yet,

735
00:34:35,684 --> 00:34:36,733
enter one

736
00:34:36,858 --> 00:34:38,658
and light it in the fire.

737
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:44,316
It is part
of the council ritual,

738
00:34:44,441 --> 00:34:46,065
because the fire represents your life.

739
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,253
If your fire goes away, so do you.

740
00:34:51,101 --> 00:34:53,887
Biggest tip
we've ever had!

741
00:34:54,012 --> 00:34:55,018
Ciera,

742
00:34:55,143 --> 00:34:56,455
today, to the test,

743
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,005
I briefly asked
how it was going.

744
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,767
The response led me to believe
it was pretty chaotic.

745
00:35:03,135 --> 00:35:05,270
Chaotic is still nice.

746
00:35:06,114 --> 00:35:10,275
I knew it would go very quickly
in Second Chance.

747
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,697
But it's crazy beyond words.

748
00:35:13,822 --> 00:35:15,372
Kass, was there a moment,

749
00:35:15,497 --> 00:35:17,149
even for someone like you

750
00:35:17,274 --> 00:35:19,351
that thrives in utter chaos,

751
00:35:19,476 --> 00:35:22,151
where you say to yourself,
"It's too much, even for me." ?

752
00:35:22,276 --> 00:35:25,015
Actually, I'm not
playing the chaos game this time.

753
00:35:25,562 --> 00:35:28,976
It's funny
that supposedly calm people

754
00:35:29,101 --> 00:35:30,996
are at the heart of the chaos
and cause it.

755
00:35:31,121 --> 00:35:32,155
Like who ?

756
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,561
Like Tasha.

757
00:35:34,193 --> 00:35:35,458
Don't play this.

758
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:36,669
Don't play this.

759
00:35:36,794 --> 00:35:38,561
Don't play that with me
now.

760
00:35:38,858 --> 00:35:40,897
Chaos is his domain,

761
00:35:41,022 --> 00:35:42,207
not mine.

762
00:35:42,457 --> 00:35:43,933
If there is chaos,

763
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,969
it's his way,
not mine.

764
00:35:46,094 --> 00:35:47,671
But I will expose your maneuvers.

765
00:35:47,948 --> 00:35:50,189
She told me
the Bayon alliance was over.

766
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,408
No it is wrong.

767
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:55,353
But Kass, in some ways,
doesn't create lies.

768
00:35:55,603 --> 00:35:58,089
Some of his words are true.

769
00:35:58,339 --> 00:36:01,593
But don't turn them to your advantage

770
00:36:01,843 --> 00:36:04,329
en disant :
"Tasha a dit bye-bye Bayon" !

771
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,107
I don't even talk like that.

772
00:36:06,232 --> 00:36:08,191
Are you talking to Kass or Ciera?

773
00:36:08,316 --> 00:36:09,768
Both.

774
00:36:10,018 --> 00:36:13,138
Ciera, do you fear
being guilty by association?

775
00:36:13,388 --> 00:36:17,005
We never want to
be in the middle of chaos

776
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:19,002
nor that one is
too interested in oneself,

777
00:36:19,127 --> 00:36:20,870
but my name
was clearly mentioned,

778
00:36:20,995 --> 00:36:22,914
this is the reality of the game.

779
00:36:24,011 --> 00:36:25,016
So, Joe,

780
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:28,646
it seems to me that even though
Ciera's name was mentioned,

781
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:30,021
like that of Kass,

782
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,548
that Tasha quarreled with,

783
00:36:31,673 --> 00:36:33,650
it could still
be anyone.

784
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,393
It could be anyone.

785
00:36:35,518 --> 00:36:37,620
But this is the first vote
after the merger,

786
00:36:37,745 --> 00:36:41,245
and everyone is afraid
to choose sides.

787
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:45,495
And so, the easiest votes
are those three.

788
00:36:46,345 --> 00:36:48,607
Ciera, what do you think
of Joe's comments?

789
00:36:48,857 --> 00:36:50,651
"It seems easy.

790
00:36:50,776 --> 00:36:52,277
It's Ciera, Kass

791
00:36:52,402 --> 00:36:54,304
or Tasha, take your pick."

792
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:57,349
It shouldn't be easy.
We should aim for the heart.

793
00:36:57,474 --> 00:37:00,243
If this vote is so easy,
you are not playing correctly.

794
00:37:00,368 --> 00:37:03,046
And I don't like to play with people
who are afraid to play.

795
00:37:03,171 --> 00:37:04,280
I want to win.

796
00:37:04,405 --> 00:37:06,940
Playing with people who don't want
to win is no fun.

797
00:37:07,065 --> 00:37:09,861
That's to say ?
Everyone wants to win.

798
00:37:09,986 --> 00:37:11,624
Only one person will win.

799
00:37:11,749 --> 00:37:13,456
Everyone should protect their interests.

800
00:37:13,581 --> 00:37:16,935
I was in a position to play
for 6th place. Do not do that !

801
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,446
Let's play for 1st place,
whatever that means to you.

802
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,673
If it means eliminating me,
go straight ahead!

803
00:37:21,798 --> 00:37:23,299
But play to win!

804
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,701
Spencer,

805
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,078
I imagine you would say,
"But I play!"

806
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,739
"Playing" is different
for each person,

807
00:37:30,033 --> 00:37:31,141
each day.

808
00:37:31,266 --> 00:37:33,376
And tomorrow,
it could be very different.

809
00:37:34,891 --> 00:37:36,922
Fishbach, that's a hell of a comment.

810
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:40,398
Because usually, in this game, we say:
"Jeff, we are 5 or 6 welded."

811
00:37:40,523 --> 00:37:41,560
Spencer dit:

812
00:37:41,685 --> 00:37:43,720
"Tonight
's vote is tonight's vote.

813
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,555
Tomorrow, everything can change."

814
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,304
This game is moving so fast.
It's so strange.

815
00:37:48,429 --> 00:37:49,467
What fusion

816
00:37:49,717 --> 00:37:53,204
sees three little women
being the likely targets?

817
00:37:53,454 --> 00:37:55,067
Things are changing right now.

818
00:37:55,192 --> 00:37:56,533
Not just in the game,

819
00:37:56,658 --> 00:37:58,771
but in the history
of Survivor strategy.

820
00:37:58,896 --> 00:38:01,838
We are witnessing an evolution
in the way of playing this game.

821
00:38:02,277 --> 00:38:05,357
Spencer, maybe you do
n't need a wedding ring at all,

822
00:38:05,482 --> 00:38:07,811
just voting blocks
for each council.

823
00:38:07,936 --> 00:38:11,715
Looking at the last three days
and the pace of this game,

824
00:38:12,104 --> 00:38:15,327
no change would surprise me.

825
00:38:15,452 --> 00:38:18,621
Ciera, is this the type of game
you are looking for?

826
00:38:18,746 --> 00:38:21,299
Namely, "Yes, I'm with you...
for now."

827
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,194
Not necessarily.
Trust comes into play.

828
00:38:24,573 --> 00:38:26,892
But we want to be in the top 4,

829
00:38:27,017 --> 00:38:28,640
pas 6e, 7e, 8e or 9e.

830
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:30,734
And some here will be.

831
00:38:30,984 --> 00:38:34,404
When you realize you are,
you go into game mode.

832
00:38:34,874 --> 00:38:37,841
Let's play!
That's all I'm saying.

833
00:38:41,354 --> 00:38:43,255
Good. It's time to vote.

834
00:38:43,505 --> 00:38:44,905
Wentworth, over to you.

835
00:39:30,427 --> 00:39:31,961
I will count the votes.

836
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:42,280
If anyone has an immunity idol
and wants to play it,

837
00:39:42,405 --> 00:39:44,074
now is the time to do it.

838
00:39:49,064 --> 00:39:51,247
Once the votes have been read,
the decision is final.

839
00:39:51,372 --> 00:39:53,750
The eliminated person
will leave the council immediately.

840
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:55,185
I will read the votes.

841
00:39:58,847 --> 00:39:59,931
First vote:

842
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:01,494
Kass.

843
00:40:02,908 --> 00:40:03,920
Ciera.

844
00:40:06,054 --> 00:40:07,063
Tasha.

845
00:40:07,496 --> 00:40:10,108
One vote Kass,
one vote Ciera, one vote Tasha.

846
00:40:12,872 --> 00:40:13,877
Kass.

847
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:16,752
Ciera.

848
00:40:20,343 --> 00:40:21,820
Tasha.
Two Kass votes,

849
00:40:21,945 --> 00:40:23,646
two Ciera votes, two Tasha votes.

850
00:40:26,207 --> 00:40:27,211
Kass.

851
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:31,016
Ciera.

852
00:40:32,981 --> 00:40:34,024
Savage.

853
00:40:34,345 --> 00:40:35,934
Three Kass votes,

854
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:38,011
three votes Ciera, two votes Tasha,

855
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:39,471
a Savage vote.

856
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,236
Kass.

857
00:40:47,462 --> 00:40:49,005
Ciera. New equality.

858
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:52,742
Four Kass votes,
four Ciera votes, two Tasha votes,

859
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:53,910
a Savage vote.

860
00:40:57,338 --> 00:40:59,124
Kass. Five votes Kass,

861
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:00,417
four votes Ciera,

862
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:01,602
one vote remains.

863
00:41:05,055 --> 00:41:07,710
Seventh person eliminated
from Survivor Second Chance

864
00:41:07,835 --> 00:41:09,526
and first member of our jury...

865
00:41:09,851 --> 00:41:11,728
Kass. Bring me your torch.

866
00:41:13,023 --> 00:41:14,527
Sorry, Kass.

867
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,939
Oh my God !

868
00:41:29,716 --> 00:41:31,356
Kass, the tribe has spoken.

869
00:41:43,927 --> 00:41:45,428
If tonight's advice

870
00:41:45,553 --> 00:41:48,106
give an idea of ​​what will follow,

871
00:41:48,231 --> 00:41:49,766
then it's gonna suck.

872
00:41:49,891 --> 00:41:51,710
Take your torches,
return to camp.

873
00:41:51,835 --> 00:41:53,035
Good night.

Stay with us, to see
a preview of the next episode.

879
00:42:12,161 --> 00:42:14,511
Next time in Survivor...

880
00:42:15,222 --> 00:42:17,233
I know he is going to play a big blow.

881
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:19,910
Everyone is worried about
the big hits to come.

882
00:42:20,035 --> 00:42:23,848
It's time to act, to go
after someone really dangerous.

883
00:42:23,973 --> 00:42:25,623
The only question is:

884
00:42:25,934 --> 00:42:27,684
who will strike first?

885
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:30,354
Loyalty has its limits.

886
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,249
This time
I wanted to build relationships

887
00:42:40,374 --> 00:42:42,333
and work on my social game.

888
00:42:42,756 --> 00:42:45,703
I think I have succeeded in my change
for 18 days.

889
00:42:45,828 --> 00:42:48,585
I wasn't
in anyone's sights.

890
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:50,820
Mais j'ai voulu
faire revenir Chaos-Kass

891
00:42:50,945 --> 00:42:53,626
et ça a dynamité mon jeu.

892
00:42:53,751 --> 00:42:55,475
Je me suis fait prendre.

893
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,705
C'est de ma faute.
