00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,545
<i>Survivor,</i> Bruce returned from

3
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:04,546
Exile Island...

4
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:05,296
>> We're going to filter water

5
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,631
through three T-shirts.

6
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:07,716
>> PROBST: ...and became a new

7
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,134
member of the Casaya tribe.

8
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:10,427
>> The tribe thought I was a

9
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,428
gift from Heaven.

10
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,345
>> He's on.

11
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,179
>> PROBST: At La Mina...

12
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,180
>> Oh, shoot!

13
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:14,347
Oh!

14
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:15,724
>> PROBST: ...things were

15
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:16,433
looking bleak.

16
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,559
>> If we could catch a few fish

17
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:18,184
a day, it would be a whole other

18
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,102
ball game.

19
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,312
>> PROBST: The reward challenge

20
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,897
was for camp comforts.

21
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,734
Tarp, lantern, some fuel.

22
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:26,735
And fire!

23
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,778
Terry once again dominated.

24
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,905
Terry makes an unbelievable

25
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:31,906
catch!

26
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,617
La Mina wins reward!

27
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,202
This time, the winners had to

28
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,579
send someone from the losing

29
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:42,542
tribe to Exile Island.

30
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,585
Who are you sending?

31
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:44,586
>> Bruce.

32
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:45,545
We're sending him back.

33
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:46,212
>> PROBST: And Bruce was

34
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,505
banished for the second time in

35
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,381
a row.

36
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,174
>> Those guys are playing for

37
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,550
keeps, huh?

38
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,635
>> PROBST: La Mina's new tarp

39
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,638
kept them warm and dry, but

40
00:00:55,722 --> 00:01:00,769
Bruce didn't fare so well.

41
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:03,229
At Casaya, Shane, Courtney,

42
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,106
Aras and Danielle's alliance

43
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,107
was strained.

44
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,317
>> You're out of your mind, man.

45
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,568
You are crazy.

46
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,028
>> These are the people that you

47
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,112
guys decided to align with.

48
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,615
How stupid is that?

49
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:14,657
>> I want one!

50
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,658
This one!

51
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,243
I just want mine!

52
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,828
>> PROBST: At the immunity

53
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,538
challenge, Bruce rejoined his

54
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,206
tribe for one of the most brutal

55
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,334
challenges yet, and Casaya

56
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,211
battled their way to victory.

57
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,171
(cheering)

58
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,007
Back at La Mina, Dan and Terry

59
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,717
schemed with Austin and Nick.

60
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,260
>> Dan and I, as soon as we got

61
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,221
the two younger guys, we got on

62
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,014
them quickly, and the plan at

63
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,224
Tribal Council tonight is to

64
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,809
vote off Misty.

65
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:41,935
>> PROBST: But Misty and Sally

66
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:42,936
had other plans.

67
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:43,978
>> Ruth Marie is pretty weak

68
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,980
right now.

69
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,065
>> Could you vote for Ruth

70
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,066
Marie?

71
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,108
>> PROBST: So Austin and Nick

72
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,110
had a tough choice to make.

73
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,362
>> We could either go with Sally

74
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:56,157
and Misty or Dan and Terry.

75
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,743
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

76
00:01:58,827 --> 00:01:59,994
the men came together...

77
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,079
>> Tonight, I'm going with the

78
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:01,287
group.

79
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,956
>> PROBST: ...and Misty became

80
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,207
the third person voted out.

81
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,795
Misty, the tribe has spoken.

82
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:09,963
13 are left.

83
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:13,925
Who will be voted out tonight?

That's a freakin' flame.

91
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,344
>> Last night, we went to Tribal

92
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:42,847
Council and Misty was voted out,

93
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:43,473
and the guys had said that the

94
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,433
vote was going to be for Ruth

95
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:48,061
Marie, so it seems I was the odd

96
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,729
woman out and it kind of

97
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:50,355
isolated me from the rest of the

98
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,814

need?

101
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:53,983
>> We're going to need some

102
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:54,359
wood.

103
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,318

that camp that are calling a lot

105
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,697
of the shots, and all I can do

106
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,366
right now is keep working hard

107
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:05,244
and prove myself valuable.

108
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,537

109
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:10,541

111
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:13,503
Austin and you.

112
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,504

113
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,047
>> What do you think?

114
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:16,589
>> Yeah.

115
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,549
>> All right.

116
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,842
I've been thinking a lot about

117
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:20,426
who should be the fifth person

118
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,179
to take to the merge, and I

119
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:24,806
thought that Ruth Marie was the

120
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:28,768
one to go with.

121
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,144
>> Well, I'm totally

122
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,855
appreciative and I'm loyal.

123
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,065
>> Yeah, well, that's why you're

124
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:34,357
here.

125
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,651
I don't think Sally feels like a

126
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,778
part of this team, and I think

127
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:39,362
when a merge comes, Sally will

128
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,407
drop us like a stone, but with

129
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,576
Ruth Marie, I think she'll stay

130
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,327
with that group of five all the

131
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,454
way to the end.

132
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,626
>> All right.

133
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,044
We have the numbers here.

134
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,379
We got the four guys and stuff,

135
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,214
and we're all four strong guys.

136
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:58,756
>> Yeah, but when the tribes

137
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,424
merge, we need a fifth.

138
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,633
>> Right.

139
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:01,968
>> And Dan suggested that it

140
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:02,510
would be Ruth Marie.

141
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,679
>> You know what?

142
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,681
That's fine, that's fine.

143
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:07,724
We've got a really strong

144
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,392
alliance of the four guys and

145
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,561
kind of a fifth right now is

146
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,105
Ruth Marie.

147
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:14,731
>> I'm pretty confident with the

148
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,858
alliance that we have.

149
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:17,483
Everybody has shaken hands on it

150
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,527
and looked each other in the

151
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,779
eye, so I have a good feeling

152
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,072
that we have an alliance that

153
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,409
will make it to the merge.

154
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,169
>> That one.

155
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,211
I got a good one.

156
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:37,920
>> There are some big ones

157
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:38,671
there.

158
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,006
>> The sun comes out.

159
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,382
Shane, myself and Bruce went

160
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,384
and got snails.

161
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,011
We got pounds of snails.

162
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,596
>> Ready to go back in?

163
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,638
>> As we're walking back, we

164
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,640
look over and we see Courtney,

165
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,600
and the problem is that I think

166
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,977
some people on this tribe don't

167
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,229
realize exactly what being on an

168
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,482
island by yourself means.

169
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:02,070
We haven't eaten today yet.

170
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,155
>> Hello, ladies.

171
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,448
>> You guys boil a pot of snails

172
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:09,035
already?

173
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,036
>> Where's "D" at?

174
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:10,828
>> How is the fish?

175
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:11,746
Sleeping.

176
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,956
How is the fish?

177
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,758
>> We got to talk about...

178
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:24,759
>> Work.

179
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,469
>> ...effort at camp.

180
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,513
>> We came back with two bags of

181
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:32,475
snails and the fire was like...

182
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,560
And nothing was ready, and Shane

183
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,522
and Aras, they'd just had it.

184
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,940
>> Yo, Bob, Danielle.

185
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:39,941
>> What?

186
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,025
>> We all want to have a talk

187
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,903
about camp responsibilities.

188
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,905
We can't be out catching food

189
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:46,489
for a whole day and then the

190
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,742
onus of fire is on us.

191
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,035
>> Honestly, that kills me to

192
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:51,661
hear that because I'm constantly

193
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:55,748
working, so I don't know.

194
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,046
I think the whole question is

195
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,673
kind of stupid.

196
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,675
>> Shane, Courtney and

197
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,260
Danielle-- I gave those people

198
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,928
my word in the alliance, but if

199
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,221
I had my druthers, I wouldn't

200
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,305
want to be in the alliance with

201
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,056
Courtney.

202
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,598
I would almost lose it on

203
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,641
purpose to get Courtney voted

204
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,060
off because she just gets on my

205
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:16,561
nerves.

206
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,563
>> When we're eating, can we

207
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,564
agree not to argue?

208
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,481
>> I didn't do anything.

209
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,817
>> No arguing during dinner.

210
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,568
>> Things were planned and

211
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,571
alliances were made, and I was

212
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,656
told that I would be the one to

213
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,325
go after Melinda, but it's just

214
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,743
constant, constant drama.

215
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,287
I love it, love it, love it.

216
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,289
Yes!

217
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,332
So my strategy right now is kind

218
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,917
of just continue to work like

219
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,003
I've been working and stay out

220
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:49,260
of the drama.

221
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:52,430
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.

222
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:59,145
Casaya, getting your first look

223
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,272
at the new La Mina tribe.

224
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,982
Misty voted out last Tribal

225
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:06,194
Council.

226
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:06,819
All right, you guys ready to get

227
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,571
to today's reward challenge?

228
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,572
>> Yeah!

229
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,199
>> PROBST: Here's how it works:

230
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,451
each tribe has six floating

231
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:13,784
puzzle pieces.

232
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,287
On my "go," one tribe member at

233
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,873
a time will swim out, dive down,

234
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:19,582
unclip a puzzle piece, and bring

235
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,210
it back to the puzzle frame.

236
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,753
Once you have the piece in the

237
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,588
puzzle frame, the next person

238
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,589
goes out.

239
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,590
Once you've collected all six of

240
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,967
the pieces you need, you can

241
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,761
start assembling the puzzle by

242
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,596
matching the corresponding

243
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,640
symbols on each side of every

244
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,683
piece of the puzzle.

245
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,976
The first tribe to get it

246
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,228
together correctly wins reward.

247
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,520
Want to know what you're playing

248
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:41,687
for?

249
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,563
>> Yeah.

250
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,189
>> PROBST: Today you are playing

251
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:47,026
for a full-on<i> Survivor</i> bathroom.

252
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,028
>> Oh, yeah.

253
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,239
>> PROBST: Towels, loofah, some

254
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,782
soap, plenty of Charmin.

255
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,783
>> That's great.

256
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,576
>> PROBST: Hopefully help take

257
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,161
the edge off.

258
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:57,787
You'll have a sink, you'll have

259
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,622
a toilet seat, you'll have a

260
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,581
bush shower.

261
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,250
You'll have five gallons of

262
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,751
fresh water.

263
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,461
"Casa de Charmin" will be

264
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:07,338
delivered to the camp who wins

265
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,548
this challenge.

266
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,259
For the losers, one person

267
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,469
will be sent from here to Exile

268
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:14,720
Island where they will remain

269
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,805
until the next immunity

270
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:16,806
challenge.

271
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:17,807
Make sense?

272
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,224
>> Yeah.

273
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,100
>> PROBST: Let's swim out, we'll

274
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,602
get started.

275
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:22,603
Here we go.

276
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,313
For reward.

277
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,982
Survivors ready?

278
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:26,649
Go!

279
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,819
Sally and Bobby in the water.

280
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:34,490
Looking for six pieces.

281
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:36,284
Bobby at the first piece.

282
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,662

La Mina pulling ahead.

287
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,674
The hard part of this is getting

288
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,883
the muscle to get it in the

289
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:53,259
ring.

290
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,176
>> There you go, there you go,

291
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:54,593
come on.

292
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:55,511

00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:57,263

>> Pull it, Bob!

298
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,143
>> PROBST: Bobby can't get it in

299
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,144

300
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:03,728
You got to get it in the ring

301
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,314
before you can move on.

302
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,274
Go, La Mina!

303
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:11,819

333
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,442

Danielle making up a lot of time

335
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:53,944

Got to get it all the way, La

Courtney made up some time.

358
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,826

Can't start solving the puzzle

You're not in.

367
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,632

368
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,384

gonna go in here and take a dump

498
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,062
before you start storing wood in

499

(owl screeches)

561
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,620
This makes the whole trip out

562

here worthwhile.

563
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:26,748
I mean, they ended up doing me a

pit somewhere else?

So Aras and Shane decided that

573
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:56,445
we should move the fire pit

574
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,448
closer to the shelter.

575
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,449
>> Right here, man.

576
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,076
>> I feel like if Shane pushes

577
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,202
or something, it happens.

578
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,287
Or if I push for something, it

579
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,788
happens.

580
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,916
And Cirie works her butt off.

581
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:09,708
But there's a lot of people on

582
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:10,834
this tribe who are just kind of

583
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:14,087
like... eh.

584
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,977
>> An aversion to working.

585
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,187
>> Oh, okay, that's, that's

586
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,396
nice.

587
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,065
>> No, I'm just telling you, I

588
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,107
think everyone has the same

589
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,317
opinion.

590
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:35,776
>> Bobby, too, huh?

591
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:36,276
He does a lot.

592
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,945
He sleeps.

593
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:38,987
>> Right now, we're not talking

594
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:39,279
about Bobby.

595
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:39,738
I'm talking about you.

596
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,615
You don't do a lot while you're

597
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,658
here.

598
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,575
>> If you're gonna be a ...

599
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,326
about it, then whatever.

600
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,369
Shane, sometimes, he has a

601
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,329
bad attitude.

602
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,372
I mean, I was a captain in

603
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,790
sports, and you just... you

604
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:50,374
don't get like that-- like

605
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,501
demeaning you, you know.

606
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,669
Why, why do you want to help

607
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,671
them?

608
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,172
>> Guys, am I the only one who

609
00:20:57,255 --> 00:20:57,464
thinks that?

610
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,967
>> What's going on?

611
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:00,801
>> That Danielle doesn't work

612
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:01,843
very hard?

613
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:02,469
>> I agree with Shane, Danielle.

614
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,222
To be perfectly honest.

615
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:05,639
>> What do you do?

616
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,057
Do you get water?

617
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,100
You ever gotten water?

618
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:08,725
Alls you do is ask people to get

619
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,269
fire for you so you can do the

620
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,311
fire.

621
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,354
That's all you do.

622
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:12,729
>> What do I do?

623
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,356
>> That's all you do!

624
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,482
>> I hunt every day...

625
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:16,566
>> I don't know if you guys

626
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,026
catch food...

627
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,611
>> I go and get as much wood as

628
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,071
you do...

629
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,656
>> I get wood, I get the water,

630
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,491
I help you guys get snails.

631
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,617
What the... What are you talking

632
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,410
about?

633
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:26,994
>> Danielle, we're not gonna

634
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,161
have this discussion...

635
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:28,954
>> No, we are gonna have this

636
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:29,830
discussion because you just made

637
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:30,455
me feel like I don't do

638
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:30,706
anything.

639
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,207
>> Are you worried about what

640
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:32,833
people think of you?

641
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:33,500
>> I'm worried about what

642
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,501
everyone thinks about me here,

643
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:35,043
and for you to say it like

644
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,003
that...

645
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:36,628
>> And everybody here won't tell

646
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,296
you because they're afraid to

647
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,381
tell you the truth!

648
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,049
>> Why are they afraid to tell

649
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:41,925
me...

650
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:42,843
>> I don't know!

651
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:43,468
Cirie, you think she works hard?

652
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,263
>> That should've been my cue...

653
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,599
to start walking.

654
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,144
But no, uh-uh, I had to stand

655
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:52,436
right there.

656
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,563
>> I think I contribute.

657
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,605
>> What?

658
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:56,648
>> ...not as hard as everyone

659
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,441
else.

660
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,525
>> Not as hard as everyone else.

661
00:21:58,608 --> 00:21:59,943
>> She does stuff...

662
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:00,736
>> Stuff.

663
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:01,528
>> ...but some people just do

664
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:02,362
more.

665
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,614
>> All right.

666
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,118
>> The Danielle-Shane-and-

667
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,661
Courtney-Aras foursome is like

668
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,455
some psychotic joke, and it

669
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:14,249
seems to be unraveling little by

670
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:17,085
little.

671
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,088
Yay.

672
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,523
>> I'm so weak now, man.

673
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,817
>> When in your life do you not

674
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:41,943
eat something all day long?

675
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,404
>> I know, it's miserable.

676
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,239
>> I'm starving.

677
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,699
It's day 11, and we really

678
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,451
haven't had anything to eat.

679
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,536
>> Oh, my God!

680
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:57,584
Look at 'em!

681
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,628
>> He's been out there a long

682
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,629
time.

683
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,255
>> How can it be so hard to

684
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,633
catch fish?

685
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,550
>> Aren't you hungry?

686
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,511
>> I am hungry, yeah.

687
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:08,011
>> You should eat more.

688
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:08,595
>> Yeah, you got to eat

689
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:11,932
something.

690
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,687
>> That's great.

691
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,856
(sighs)

692
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,858
We really suck at fishing.

693
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:22,609
We're catching no fish.

694
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:25,028
We haven't eaten.

695
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,321
I figure we've got about three

696
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,740
more days before the entire

697
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,575
tribe can't get out of bed.

698
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,619
So we're in pretty dire straits

699
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:35,080
right now.

700
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,832
>> That sucks.

701
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,334
>> Today is the roughest day so

702
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:40,877
far, plus with Super Terry

703
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,212
being gone...

704
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,672
That stupid fire.

705
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,048
We cannot get that thing going

706
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,425
without a dogfight.

707
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,554
(blowing)

708
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,810
>> You've got to be kidding me.

709
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,895
>> It's raining, guys.

710
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,063
>> What do we do now?

711
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,190
>> We really didn't need that.

712
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,775
>> Let's just gather the stuff

713
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,610
up.

714
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,069
>> The guys are really

715
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,696
struggling today.

716
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,239
And I don't know how much game

717
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,657
these people have left in them.

718
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,867
>> I'm tired, man.

719
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,951
>> I'm just wrecked.

720
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:13,660
>> It's just so frustrating

721
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,787
'cause it's my butt on the

722
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:16,454
line.

723
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,497
And if we lose another immunity

724
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:26,339
challenge, I'm going home.

725
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:38,476
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

726
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,603
We'll now bring in Terry,

727
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,938
returning from Exile Island.

728
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,565
>> There he is.

729
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,733
>> PROBST: Welcome back.

730
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:48,653
(applause)

731
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,906
Long two days out there?

732
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,741
>> Peaceful two days.

733
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,783
>> PROBST: The good side to

734
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:54,951
Exile Island is the hidden

735
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,077
immunity idol.

736
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:56,703
Here's what we know: only three

737
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,538
people have been to Exile

738
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,623
Island.

739
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:00,957
Misty was voted out.

740
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,751
She obviously didn't have it.

741
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,211
Bruce and Terry are the only

742
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,629
two people who have been there.

743
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:06,671
They may have found it.

744
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,215
It may still be up for grabs.

745
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:08,757
Certainly a valuable item

746
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,384
either way.

747
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:11,885
You guys ready to get to

748
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,012
today's immunity challenge?

749
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:14,471
>> Yeah.

750
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,388
>> Yep.

751
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,181
>> PROBST: First things first,

752
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,849
Shane.

753
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:21,019
Thank you.

754
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:21,603
Immunity, it's back up for

755
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:22,687
grabs.

756
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,106
For today's immunity challenge,

757
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,399
you're going to have to test

758
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,193
your balance, your teamwork,

759
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,778
and your patience.

760
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,363
Here's how it works: one person

761
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,949
will begin seated on a chair,

762
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,617
which is attached to a pulley.

763
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,701
Another person will be situated

764
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:37,744
directly above them in a crow's

765
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:40,330
nest where an empty water drum

766
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:40,664
hangs.

767
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,582
The other four remaining tribe

768
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,125
members will be tied together

769
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,126
in pairs.

770
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,503
You'll race across a balance

771
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:47,796
beam carrying buckets.

772
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,089
Once you reach the water, dip

773
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,423
your bucket in, get water, and

774
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,216
race back.

775
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,676
You'll then empty your water

776
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:53,927
into a larger pail.

777
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,220
The person in the crow's nest

778
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,596
will pull that pail up, empty

779
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,057
the water into the drum.

780
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,934
As the drum takes on water, it

781
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,185
will lower.

782
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:02,811
The person in the chair will

783
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,021
rise until they're high enough

784
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:05,814
to pull the pin, releasing the

785
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,024
tribe flag.

786
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,609
First tribe to release their

787
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,861
flag wins immunity, is safe

788
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,738
from Tribal Council.

789
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,532
Losers, another person will be

790
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:16,616
going home.

791
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,243
One big rule: if you fall off

792
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,870
the balance beam at any point,

793
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,414
you lose all of your water in

794
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:23,832
your buckets and go back to the

795
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:24,249
start.

796
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:25,292
Casaya, you have one extra

797
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:25,500
member.

798
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:26,626
You're sitting somebody out.

799
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,211
You cannot sit out the same

800
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,212
person in back-to-back

801
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,338
challenges.

802
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:30,797
>> Bob-dog.

803

804
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,549

All right.

806
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,259
Give you a minute to strategize

807
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,177
and we'll go.

808
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,595
All right, pairs for Casaya

809
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,639

810
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:39,889

813
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,021
Here we go.

814
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,314
For immunity.

815
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:50,150
Survivors ready?

816
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,568
Go!

817
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:52,652

navigate.

835

Right of way goes to Sally and

955
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,183
>> Go fast!

956
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,226
>> PROBST: We are very even.

957
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,727
You're getting close to having

958
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:13,978
enough water.

959
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,022
Austin pouring carefully.

960
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,107
Casaya gets their water in more

961
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,192
quickly.

962
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:19,859
Will this be enough?

963
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,153
It could be a race to the

964
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,280
finish!

965
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,990
Cirie dumps it.

966
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,909
It might be.

967
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:28,451
>> Come on!

968
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,370
>> Come on, baby!

969
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,788
>> PROBST: La Mina's bucket is

970
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:32,288
full.

971
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,915
Who's going to get there first?

972
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:34,874
(cheering)

973
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:40,088
Casaya wins immunity!

974
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,966
(cheers and applause)

975
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,927
>> Way to work, man!

976
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,720
>> PROBST: Another evenly

977
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,264
matched challenge, but Casaya

978
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:53,518
continues their winning streak.

979
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,562
Congratulations.

980
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:56,896
La Mina, a return visit to

981
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,356
Tribal Council.

982
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,315
Somebody else going home.

983
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,358
You have the afternoon to

984
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,651
figure out who that's going to

985
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:01,818
be.

986
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,027
Get your stuff, head on back,

987
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:08,199
I'll see you at Tribal.

988
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:28,845
>> The fire.

989
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:29,470
>> Where do you want to build

990
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,680
it, up there?

991
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:31,931
>> Up there.

992
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,058
>> We were absolutely thrilled

993
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,643
to see Terry, and it was very

994
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,812
comforting to have somebody

995
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:40,023
come in and just take over

996
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:40,231
again.

997
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,524
It was fabulous.

998
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,817
>> Did they give you one clue

999
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,443
or did they give you everybody's

1000
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,902
clue up till now?

1001
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:45,528
>> Everybody's clue up till now.

1002
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,238
Where to try to find it and

1003
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:47,739
everything.

1004
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:48,531
It was a bear.

1005
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,824
>> How much time did you spend

1006
00:31:49,907 --> 00:31:50,408
looking?

1007
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,368
>> Maybe I looked, uh, two hours

1008
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,162
or something.

1009
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,497
>> We talked about my two days

1010
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,915
on Exile Island, but nobody has

1011
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,084
directly asked me, "Did you

1012
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,502
find the idol?"

1013
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,004
So my intention is to hide the

1014
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,797
immunity idol.

1015
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,633
I want to have that in my back

1016
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:07,216
pocket in case I need it down

1017
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,968
the road.

1018
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,304
>> I hate losing, guys.

1019
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,848
>> I know we did our best.

1020
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:14,807
>> We lost the immunity

1021
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:15,725
challenge.

1022
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:18,269
That sends us to Tribal Council.

1023
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,854
Not happy about going there

1024
00:32:19,937 --> 00:32:20,772
tonight.

1025
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:21,564
I don't think there's any way

1026
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:22,398
around the fact that we're

1027
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,399
going to be voting out Sally.

1028
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,025
>> All right, here's the deal.

1029
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,902
I just want to tell you,

1030
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:26,486
whatever happens tonight, I

1031
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:27,987
respect you both.

1032
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,823
I know there's an alliance, but

1033
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:31,824
I do have a lot of game left in

1034
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:32,950
me.

1035
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:33,785
>> We know you do.

1036
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:34,827
>> And I'd like to be here

1037
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,663
tomorrow, so that's all I have

1038
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:37,830
to say about that.

1039
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,999
I went up to Terry and just

1040
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,125
said, "You know, I proved

1041
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,169
myself at the challenge today,

1042
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,379
and I feel like I still deserve

1043
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,755
to be here."

1044
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:46,756
All right, well, we're going to

1045
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,757
go get some water.

1046
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,633
Who knows if that will sway

1047
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,301
anything?

1048
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,636
Terry calls the shots around

1049
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:52,637
here, and if he doesn't think

1050
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,638
I'm worth keeping around, then

1051
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,848
I'm gone tonight.

1052
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,103
>> I know.

1053
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,854
I'm thinking about our tribe

1054
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:02,855
here, man, because before we

1055
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:03,648
know it, it's going to be down

1056
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:04,565
to the four of us.

1057
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,483
We don't want to go in four

1058
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,484
people at the merge.

1059
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,360
We're going to get picked off

1060
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:08,277
one by one, you first.

1061
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,195
You've got the biggest target on

1062
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,947
your back of anybody on this

1063
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,032
whole beach.

1064
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:20,415
>> Shane's a good athlete.

1065
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,040
He's better than I thought he

1066
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,959
was.

1067
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:23,751
>> Yeah, there's definitely a

1068
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,669
lot more than meets the eye with

1069
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:25,586
the Shane dog.

1070
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,629
>> Oh, yeah.

1071
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,464
>> Oh.

1072
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,299
But here's the thing.

1073
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,342
You never promised Ruth Marie,

1074
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,760
I never promised her.

1075
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:33,845
Nor did Nick.

1076
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,012
>> Mm-hmm.

1077
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,639
>> Yeah, Dan just gave his word,

1078
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,557
shook his hand.

1079
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,558
We never made that pact with

1080
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:39,308
her.

1081
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,853
>> Austin came up to me and

1082
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,563
pitched voting off Ruth Marie

1083
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:44,981
instead of Sally.

1084
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,899
Ruth Marie was given a promise

1085
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,860
and a handshake by Dan alone,

1086
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:49,485
but since then, some things have

1087
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,404
changed.

1088
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:52,071
My goal was to come into the

1089
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,615
merge with numbers, and it's not

1090
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,742
looking good right now.

1091
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:56,659
>> What do you think?

1092
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,412
>> Okay.

1093
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,371
>> You are?

1094
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,748
>> Cool.

1095
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,249
I thought it was going to take

1096
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,542
a water-into-wine type of

1097
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,169
miracle to pull Terry into

1098
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,712
keeping Sally as our fifth.

1099
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,380
Apparently, I got some Jesus of

1100
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,132
Nazareth-like powers myself.

1101
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,760
>> I know how you gave Ruth

1102
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:16,721
Marie a handshake, but neither

1103
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:17,555
one of us did.

1104
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,306
I know you made a promise, and

1105
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,641
your word is your bond, and, uh,

1106
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,393
that's fine.

1107
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,102
But I'm looking at getting us

1108
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:26,272
four intact to the merge, and,

1109
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,399
uh, the strongest way possible

1110
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:29,942
is to have the strongest player,

1111
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,695
I think, which is Sally.

1112
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,238
>> I just can't believe how

1113
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,323
quickly it falls apart.

1114
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,991
Austin and Terry-- they're

1115
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:38,326
saying now, "You had the

1116
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,285
handshake with Ruth, so it's

1117
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,870
okay for us to back out."

1118
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,830
But we had an understanding to

1119
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,582
go to the final five, and to

1120
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,167
change horses midstream is a big

1121
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,543
mistake.

1122
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,337
It's crazy.

1123
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,005
Be aware.

1124
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:51,547
If we take out Ruth tonight,

1125
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,131
we're down to four anyway,

1126
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,801
'cause Sally is going to jump

1127
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:55,384
ship.

1128
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,677
I don't care what she says.

1129
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,054
She'll say anything right now.

1130
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,263
>> Dude, I know she'll stay with

1131
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,431
us.

1132
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,349
She wants to be in this alliance

1133
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,183
so bad, she...

1134
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,184
>> Well, that's my thing.

1135
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,393
She wants to be in it so bad...

1136
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,436
>> I...

1137
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,354
>> ...she'll do whatever.

1138
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,355
Whereas Ruth would die on her

1139
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,273
sword before she would give up

1140
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,233
her word.

1141
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:11,651
I think Sally would say, "It's

1142
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:12,944
a game.

1143
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,111
I'm playing the game.

1144
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,154
I'm switching around."

1145
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,573
>> There's a lot of strategy

1146
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:18,699
discussion amongst the tribe

1147
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,367
right now.

1148
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,910
Terry-- he tried to get real

1149
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:21,953
technical about it, said it was

1150
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,704
really just Dan's promise to

1151
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:24,831
Ruth Marie, and it's kind of

1152
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,874
like an easy, hollow

1153
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,292
rationalization.

1154
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,878
I feel bad the way it's turned.

1155
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,046
Ruth Marie is part of the five

1156
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:33,339
of us, so I just...

1157
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:35,174
I don't want to go back on that.

1158
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,259
>> Oh, look, they're all in

1159
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:37,176
here.

1160
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:37,385
Look.

1161
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,136
>> Yeah.

1162
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,221
>> It's a shame to pack up

1163
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,764
my stuff and leave here with so

1164
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,349
much left to offer this tribe.

1165
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,851
It still could change.

1166
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:45,977
I know there's some talking

1167
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,144
going on.

1168
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,312
It's like the almighty men are

1169
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,230
upstairs plotting, and us little

1170
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,691
woman are just down here going,

1171
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:52,483
"I wonder what they're going to

1172
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,317
do."

1173
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:53,734
>> Tell you what.

1174
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:54,235
We're going to eat every

1175
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,403
stinking one of them.

1176
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,488
>> I'm never going to be

1177
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,406
confident in Tribal Council, but

1178
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:01,784
I'm not walking around paranoid.

1179
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,244
I don't think it's me tonight.

1180
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,247
So Sally will be going home,

1181
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,416
unless something turns that I

1182
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,544
don't know about.

1183
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:13,129
>> This is going to be a Tribal

1184
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,755
Council for the books right

1185
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:15,506
here.

1186
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,382
Dan is campaigning hard for Ruth

1187
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,342
Marie.

1188
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,343
I'm pulling for Sally.

1189
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,303
So tonight's vote is completely

1190
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:21,220
still up in the air.

1191
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:21,804
We don't know what's going to

1192
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,307
happen.

1193
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,518
(insects chirring)

1194
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,199
>> PROBST: Welcome back to

1195
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:42,575
Tribal Council.

1196
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,619
>> Thanks.

1197
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,244
>> PROBST: Terry, tell me about

1198
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,288
Exile Island.

1199
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,206
Describe it to somebody who has

1200
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:49,624
never been there.

1201
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,251
>> Uh, basically, you're there

1202
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,503
with a barrel of untreated

1203
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,297
water, a flint and a machete.

1204
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,466
No sleeping quarters.

1205
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,550
You've got to try to go gather

1206
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,260
your own food, and that's it.

1207
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,470
It's a unique experience, but I

1208
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,721
don't necessarily want to go

1209
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:06,015
back there.

1210
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:06,641
>> PROBST: Sally, did anybody

1211
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,184
question him about the immunity

1212
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,310
idol?

1213
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:09,894
>> We talked about it a little

1214
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:10,937
bit.

1215
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,729
You know, he kind of said, "I

1216
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:12,396
spent a couple of hours looking

1217
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,272
for it."

1218
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,066
He didn't give anything away,

1219
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:15,524
but he didn't give any

1220
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,234
indication to let us know that

1221
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,194
he found it, either.

1222
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,320
>> PROBST: Austin, what did you

1223
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,821
miss about Terry when he was

1224
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:21,489
gone?

1225
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,990
>> The best thing about having

1226
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:23,991
Terry around is he's a natural

1227
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,034
leader.

1228
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,285
When he was gone, the rest of us

1229
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,328
were kind of floundering.

1230
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,663
It's not like we're all inept

1231
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:29,872
people, but it's nice to have

1232
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,415
somebody kind of take charge and

1233
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:31,999
say, "Hey, you guys be doing

1234
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,250
this," type of thing.

1235
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,919
So, it's nice to have him back.

1236
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:35,920
>> PROBST: Let's talk about

1237
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,046
individual performance today in

1238
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,297
the challenge.

1239
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,925
Sally, you dominated.

1240
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:41,842
>> No matter what the challenge

1241
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,052
is, whether it's immunity or

1242
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:43,678
whatever, I'm going to give it

1243
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,470
everything I have.

1244
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,389
My best days out here are the

1245
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:47,765
days where we compete.

1246
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:48,849
And there was no way I was

1247
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:49,642
falling off that thing, and I

1248
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,394
went as fast as I could, so...

1249
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,521
>> PROBST: Austin, what mistake

1250
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,231
have you made in the 11 days?

1251
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,108
>> Just in the challenge today.

1252
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,609
The bottom line was, both tribes

1253
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,111
had ample water to finish it

1254
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:00,486
off.

1255
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,780
Had I known that that was the

1256
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:03,656
amount that was going to put us

1257
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:04,448
over the edge, I wouldn't have

1258
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,449
been pouring like my

1259
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,575
grandmother.

1260
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:07,410
You know, I was over there just

1261
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,828
taking my sweet, precious time

1262
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:09,537
with it.

1263
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,746
Meanwhile, they polish it off,

1264
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,747
and they win the thing.

1265
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:12,873
So, you know, I'll take the

1266
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:13,541
blame for that.

1267
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,501
>> PROBST: Ruth Marie, what's

1268
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,461
holding you back in this tribe?

1269
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,255
>> Um, I think I'm small in

1270
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,465
stature, and I'm twice as old

1271
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,801
as the other women.

1272
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:24,719
>> PROBST: But you've been out

1273
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:25,636
here 11 days.

1274
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,595
Do you feel like you've proven

1275
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,471
yourself?

1276
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,889
>> I do.

1277
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,016
>> PROBST: Let's go back to the

1278
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,308
last Tribal Council.

1279
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,309
Sally, you're one big happy

1280
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,561
tribe, and then Misty goes.

1281
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,438
Never saw it coming.

1282
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,647
Surprised?

1283
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,356
>> Oh, yeah, I was very

1284
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,399
surprised.

1285
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:38,941
I was the only one who voted

1286
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,317
with Misty.

1287
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,068
I mean, I was the only one who

1288
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,194
didn't know what was going on,

1289
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,571
so clearly, I was surprised.

1290
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,405
>> PROBST: Do you think you know

1291
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:44,905
what's going on tonight?

1292
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:45,573
>> You know, it's hard to say.

1293
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,576
I think everybody here is great,

1294
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:49,910
and I want to be here tomorrow,

1295
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:50,828
and I want to wake up tomorrow

1296
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,371
in that bamboo bed, but so does

1297
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,457
everybody else, so...

1298
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,208
>> PROBST: Ruth Marie, if it's

1299
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,293
you, what will this tribe miss

1300
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,502
tomorrow?

1301
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,795
>> I don't know that they will

1302
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:00,963
miss it tomorrow, but I am just

1303
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:04,925
steady, steady, steady, and get

1304
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,094
better as the game goes on.

1305
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:07,636
And I am an extremely loyal

1306
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,889
person.

1307
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,724
And that may show up down the

1308
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:12,558
road.

1309
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,977
>> PROBST: Okay, before we get

1310
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:15,603
to the vote, Terry, you're the

1311
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,313
only person who has been to

1312
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,606
Exile Island.

1313
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,066
You may or may not have found

1314
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:20,983
the idol.

1315
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,109
If you need to, you'll let me

1316
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,235
know after the vote.

1317
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,445
It is time to vote.

1318
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,531
Austin, you're up.

1319
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,169
>> It's probably going to be you

1320
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,087
or me tonight, girl, so I'll

1321
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,340
miss you.

1322
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,474
>> Sally, I adore you, but I'm

1323
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:57,561
voting my alliance.

1324
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,360
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1325
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:07,488
votes.

1326
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:15,913
>> PROBST: Once the votes are

1327
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,039
read, the decision is final.

1328
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:17,998
The person voted out will be

1329
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:18,874
asked to leave the Tribal

1330
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:19,625
Council area immediately.

1331
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:23,045
I'll read the votes.

1332
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:27,174
First vote, Ruthie.

1333
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:32,888
Sally.

1334
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:35,224
Ruth.

1335
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:39,019
Two votes Ruth, one vote Sally.

1336
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:39,478
Sally.

1337
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,480
We're tied-- two votes Sally,

1338
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,608
two votes Ruth.

1339
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,486
That's three votes Ruthie.

1340
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,904
Two votes Sally.

1341
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:53,409
One vote left.

1342
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:54,201
Fourth person voted out of the

1343
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,536
<i>Survivor: Exile Island--</i> Ruth

1344
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:55,703
Marie.

1345
00:40:55,786 --> 00:41:00,624
You need to bring me your torch.

1346
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,173
Ruth Marie, the tribe has

1347
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:09,675
spoken.

1348
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:14,722
It's time for you to go.

1349
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:21,520
Well, in spite of the fact that

1350
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,023
you've lost two tribe members in

1351
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:26,567
a row, you still seem positive,

1352
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,111
and that more than anything can

1353
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,196
help you to turn this game

1354
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,113
around.

1355
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:31,947
Grab your torches.

1356
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:32,740
Back to camp.

1357
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:36,827
Good night.

Mina.

1367
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:56,764
>> I just felt wrecked.

1368
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,933
>> PROBST: Bruce's Zen garden is

1369
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,309
invaded by Courtney.

1370
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:01,810
>> We have the whole beach, and

1371
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:02,770
she picks this spot.

1372
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,772
I'd rather be on Exile Island

1373
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:05,606
than be around Courtney.

1374
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:05,981
(thunder rumbling)

1375
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:06,607
>> PROBST: And Casaya's spark is

1376
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,566
snuffed out.

1377
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,653
>> This is a nightmare.

1378
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,742
>> I think my tribe

1379
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:19,536
underestimated the endurance

1380
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,746
that I have.

1381
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:21,914
I'm not upset about their

1382
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:22,164
decision.

1383
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,374
It's a game.

1384
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:24,208
It's fun.

1385
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,084
There are lots of twists and

1386
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,210
turns, but when you go through

1387
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,211
an experience like this, it

1388
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,212
humbles you a little bit.

1389
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:31,966
So, Sally, Dan, Terry, Austin,

1390
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,175
and Nick, I just wish them good

1391
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:36,262
luck.
