1
00:00:10,034 --> 00:00:10,827
NO ONE CAN KNOW.

2
00:00:10,862 --> 00:00:12,793
I LITERALLY SCOOP UP HER BAG.

3
00:00:12,827 --> 00:00:24,517
THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE PIE
GAME.

4
00:00:24,551 --> 00:00:27,241
THAT WAS BE TENSE.

5
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:30,034
TONIGHT'S DOUBLE TRIBAL SHOWS
YOU CANNOT BE TOO COMFORTABLE IN

6
00:00:30,068 --> 00:00:31,241
THIS GAME.

7
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:33,172
AARON HAS PROVEN TO BE ONE OF
THE BIGGEST THREAT SO IT WAS

8
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:34,793
IMPORTANT TO ELIMINATE THE
THREAT.

9
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:37,482
BUT MI SUPERNERVOUS BECAUSE I
DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON AT

10
00:00:37,517 --> 00:00:40,206
THE OTHER TRIBAL AND MISSY IS
PLAYING SO HARD.

11
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:44,034
AND MY BIGGEST FEAR IS THAT THE
GIRLS ARE GOING TO ALIGN AGAINST

12
00:00:44,068 --> 00:00:48,931
TOMMY BECAUSE TOMMY IS MY NUMBER
ONE IN THE GAME.

13
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,758
OH MY GOSH.

14
00:00:50,793 --> 00:00:52,034
TOMMY.

15
00:00:52,068 --> 00:00:55,068
AND THEN I SEE TOMMY,'S BIG
LANKY BODY CLIMBING UPSTAIRS AND

16
00:00:55,103 --> 00:00:57,034
A RUSH OF CALM JUST CAME OVER
ME.

17
00:00:57,068 --> 00:00:58,172
I'M LIKE OKAY.

18
00:00:58,206 --> 00:01:04,068
AND NOW IT'S MORE OF A QUESTION
WHERE WE GO FROM HERE.

19
00:01:04,103 --> 00:01:04,724
MISSY?

20
00:01:04,758 --> 00:01:05,965
SHUT UP.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,275
MISSY WAS SO GOOD THAT WHEN
SHE HAD HER CONVERSATION WITH

22
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,275
KARISHMA, SHE SETS HER DOWN ON
THE BEACH.

23
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:16,137
THE FIRST SHING SHE DONE WAS
START TELLING KARISHMA TO TELL

24
00:01:16,172 --> 00:01:18,793
ME WHAT TO DO TO VOTE TOMMY OUT.

25
00:01:18,827 --> 00:01:20,034
TONIGHT WAS INCREDIBLE.

26
00:01:20,068 --> 00:01:23,827
I JUST WANT TO DO A HAPPY DANCE
WAWS MY TOP TWO TARGETS WENT

27
00:01:23,862 --> 00:01:24,965
ONLY, AARON AND MISSY.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,310
BOTH OF THEM WERE GUNNING FOR
ME.

29
00:01:27,344 --> 00:01:28,344
BOTH GONE IN ONE SWOOP.

30
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,241
I DIDN'T HAVE TO USE MY IDOL.

31
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:33,241
I STILL HAVE IT HERE IN MY TUSY
LITTLE ARM PILT.

32
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:34,758
SO I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER.

33
00:01:34,793 --> 00:01:37,344
THE GAME HAS JUST OPENED
COMPLETELY WIDE FOR ME.

34
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:41,551
AND NOW I FINALLY HAVE SOME
OPTIONS.

35
00:01:41,586 --> 00:01:45,275
TODAY SUCKED FOR ME, YOU
KNOW.

36
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,137
IT SUCKED HARD.

37
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,413
AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT NEEDED
THAT.

38
00:01:48,448 --> 00:01:50,241
SO IT HAPPENED.

39
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:54,068
I FEEL A LITTLE STRANDED
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE MY CLOSEST

40
00:01:54,103 --> 00:01:55,724
ALLIES ARE GONE.

41
00:01:55,758 --> 00:01:57,931
THEY OFFERED ME A LOT OF
PROTECTION.

42
00:01:57,965 --> 00:02:01,034
AND NOW I DON'T HAVE THAT FROM
EITHER OF THEM ANY MORE.

43
00:02:01,068 --> 00:02:03,586
YOU CAN BUILD RELATIONSHIPS
THAT YOU COULDN'T BUILD.

44
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,620
RIGHT.

45
00:02:04,655 --> 00:02:07,275
BUT NOW WITH THEM BEING GONE,
I AM ON MY OWN.

46
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:21,103
AND I AM GOING TO DO WHAT I HAVE
TO DO TO STAY HERE.

47
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:24,137
LAST NIGHT I WENT FROM THE
MOST NERVOUS I'VE BEEN IN MY

48
00:02:24,172 --> 00:02:28,172
LIFE TO PROBABLY THE HAPPIEST,
NOT ONLY WAS A SAFE BUT BLIND

49
00:02:28,206 --> 00:02:31,103
SIDING MISSY WITH A HUGE MOVE ON
MY RESUME.

50
00:02:31,137 --> 00:02:34,551
YOU REALLY SHOOK ME LAST
NIGHT, I GUESS.

51
00:02:34,586 --> 00:02:39,793
YEAH, IT WAS FRIGGING.

52
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:42,482
LAST NIGHT WAS HUGE, SICK.

53
00:02:42,517 --> 00:02:43,344
CRAZY.

54
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:46,379
WHAT DO YOU WANT, YOU STILL
WARRANT.

55
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:54,344
I AGREE I JUST THINK IN TERMS
OF ME, I KNOW WHO I CAN'T BEAT.

56
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:55,310
WHO.

57
00:02:55,344 --> 00:02:56,551
>>.

58
00:02:56,586 --> 00:02:58,344
CAR SHALL MA IS AN EASY VOTE,
THEN SITTING THERE IN FINAL

59
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,172
THREE AND WE ARE ALL LOOKING AT
EACH OTHER.

60
00:03:01,206 --> 00:03:04,172
KARISHMA IS THE ULTIMATE
GOAT, HAVE I BEEN WANTING HER

61
00:03:04,206 --> 00:03:05,655
OUT FOR A LONG LONG TIME.

62
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:09,000
AND WITHOUT MISSY AND AARON AS
THE TWO BIGGEST THREATS IN FRONT

63
00:03:09,034 --> 00:03:15,689
OF ME, IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF
TIME BEFORE MYSELF, TOMMY AND

64
00:03:15,724 --> 00:03:17,275
ELIZABETH ARE TARGETED.

65
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,344
THE ARMY HAS ASSEMBLED.

66
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:21,000
IT IS ME, YOU AND HER GOING
NEXT.

67
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,172
WE'RE NOT LETTING YOU GO.

68
00:03:23,206 --> 00:03:25,724
IT SIN CREDIBLE.

69
00:03:25,758 --> 00:03:30,482
RIGHT NOW IT IS LIKE
ATTENTION, GOAT NUMBER ONE,

70
00:03:30,517 --> 00:03:33,724
KARISHMA REPORTING FOR DUTY,
ATTENTION, GOAT NUMBER TWO,

71
00:03:33,758 --> 00:03:34,896
NOURA REPORTING FOR DUTY.

72
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:38,862
AND THEN THEY ALL LINE UP, A
ESSENTIALING THE GO ARMEY TO

73
00:03:38,896 --> 00:03:42,517
KNOCK OUT ONE OF THESE BIG
THREATS, ELIZABETH, TOMMY.

74
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:47,206
IT IS NOT HAPPENED.

75
00:03:47,241 --> 00:03:51,931
IT IS SOMETHING I DEFINITELY
SUBSCRIBE TO BUT ELIZABETH IS AN

76
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:56,655
OLYMPIC ATHLETE, ALSO ELIZABETH
WROTE MY NAME DOWN SO ELIZABETH

77
00:03:56,689 --> 00:04:08,655
IS GOING TO BE ON MY RADAR AND
SHE MIGHT HAVE TO GO NEXT.

78
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:15,931
LET'S GO.

79
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:18,551
COMING.

80
00:04:18,586 --> 00:04:20,137
READ THE NOTE, TOMMY.

81
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:21,034
HERE WE GO.

82
00:04:21,068 --> 00:04:23,000
WHOA.

83
00:04:23,034 --> 00:04:26,551
CHOOSE ONE PERSON TO COME TO
THE ISLAND OF THE IDOLS TRK MUST

84
00:04:26,586 --> 00:04:27,586
BE UNANIMOUS.

85
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,931
IF YOU CANNOT AGREE, DRAW ONE
NAME FROM THE BAG.

86
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:33,241
THAT PERSON MUST GET ON THE BOAT
IMMEDIATELY.

87
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:34,034
I WANT TO GO.

88
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:35,413
I VOTE LAUREN.

89
00:04:35,448 --> 00:04:39,551
MY INITIAL THOUGHT IS I AM
HOPING IT IS ME.

90
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:40,551
I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE YET.

91
00:04:40,586 --> 00:04:43,344
I COULD CERTAINLY USE AN
ADVANTAGE.

92
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:46,517
BUT BEFORE I CAN EVEN TAKE A
BREATHE TO SAY A WORD LAUREN

93
00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:48,586
CHIMES IN AND IS LIKE I WANT TO
GO.

94
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,137
CAN I GO?

95
00:04:52,172 --> 00:04:55,689
THE PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY RUN
THIS TRIED HAVE SPOKEN UP AND

96
00:04:55,724 --> 00:04:57,517
HAVE DECIDED WHO IS GOING.

97
00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:58,758
WHOOO.

98
00:04:58,793 --> 00:05:02,241
BUT IF I WERE TO SAY I DON'T
AGREE, THAT WOULD JUST PUT A

99
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:06,137
BIGGER TARGET ON MY BACK SO I
HAVE TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND

100
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,103
KEEP MY MOUTH CLOSED.

101
00:05:08,137 --> 00:05:09,206
NO, GO.

102
00:05:09,241 --> 00:05:11,275
THIS IS YOUR FRIEND, THE
CHICKEN.

103
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,655
NO, CHICKEN.

104
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:13,758
THIS IS FOR ME.

105
00:05:13,793 --> 00:05:15,724
GO, GO CHICKEN.

106
00:05:15,758 --> 00:05:20,689
SHE IS STUBBORN, SHE REMINDS
ME OF BOSTON ROB.

107
00:05:20,724 --> 00:05:21,931
RIGHT?

108
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:27,103
OH MY GOSH, SHE'S SO CLOSE TO
ME I CAN FEEL HER FEATHERS.

109
00:05:27,137 --> 00:05:28,068
WHAT HAPPENED?

110
00:05:28,103 --> 00:05:31,482
SHE BIT MY FINGER.

111
00:05:31,517 --> 00:05:34,379
THIS BITCH BIT MY FINGER.

112
00:05:34,413 --> 00:05:36,793
NOW SHE IS EATING THAT
PAPAYA.

113
00:05:36,827 --> 00:05:38,586
ALL THAT LOYALTY ALL THESE
DAYS.

114
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,689
IT AIN'T FUNNY.

115
00:05:39,724 --> 00:05:40,586
YEAH, IT IS.

116
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,310
SHE BIT MY FINGER.

117
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,310
ISLAND OF THE IDOLS IS
DEFINITELY A PART OF THE GAME

118
00:05:46,344 --> 00:05:47,413
THAT I AM MISSING.

119
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:51,448
AND I'M SO EXCITED THAT I AM
ABOUT TO EXPERIENCE IT.

120
00:05:51,482 --> 00:05:55,517
OH MY GOD.

121
00:05:55,551 --> 00:05:57,034
OH MY GOD.

122
00:05:57,068 --> 00:05:57,827
OH MY GOD.

123
00:05:57,862 --> 00:06:01,206
THIS IS CRAZY.

124
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:02,275
OH MY GOD!

125
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,827
OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD.

126
00:06:05,862 --> 00:06:09,034
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, GIRL?

127
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:11,000
ARE YOU WAY TOO EXCITE.

128
00:06:11,034 --> 00:06:15,931
GRAB YOUR BAG AND THEN WE'RE
GOING TO GO INTO AND EXPLAIN

129
00:06:15,965 --> 00:06:16,655
EVERYTHING.

130
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:17,206
OHMIGOD.

131
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:18,206
COME ON, COME ON.

132
00:06:18,241 --> 00:06:19,241
COME ON IN.

133
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:24,689
YOU GUYS ARE THE REASON
PEOPLE PLAY THIS GAME.

134
00:06:24,724 --> 00:06:27,862
WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH YOU BACK AT CAMP AND HOW

135
00:06:27,896 --> 00:06:29,827
ARE YOU DOING SO FAR IN THE
GAME?

136
00:06:29,862 --> 00:06:32,172
I'M DOING OKAY IN THE GAME.

137
00:06:32,206 --> 00:06:36,965
I DEFINITELY AM THE LEAD IN
ATHLETICS BUT I'M A VERY STRONG

138
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,275
SOCIAL PLAYER.

139
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,482
I DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS GOING TO
HAVE AS MUCH STRATEGY AS I DID.

140
00:06:41,517 --> 00:06:43,551
LET ME EXPLAIN HOW IT WORKS
WHEN PEOPLE COME TO THE ISLAND

141
00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:44,517
OF THE IDOLS.

142
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:46,862
EVERYONE THAT COMES HERE GETS A
LESSON.

143
00:06:46,896 --> 00:06:52,103
TODAY YOUR LESSON IS ABOUT
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS.

144
00:06:52,137 --> 00:06:55,413
WE'LL GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO
PREDICT WHO WINS THE NEXT

145
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,551
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

146
00:06:57,586 --> 00:07:01,206
IF YOU ARE RIGHT, YOU EARN AN
IMMUNITY IDOL GOOD FOR THE NEXT

147
00:07:01,241 --> 00:07:04,068
TWO TRIBAL COUNCILS.

148
00:07:04,103 --> 00:07:09,413
IF YOU ARE WRONG, YOU LOSE YOUR
VOTE.

149
00:07:09,448 --> 00:07:13,206
HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW YOUR TRIBE
MATES.

150
00:07:13,241 --> 00:07:17,068
AFTER PLAYING THIS GAME WITH
THEM, DO YOU THINK YOU CAN

151
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:22,275
ACCURATELY PREDICT WHO'S GOING
TO WIN IMMUNITY?

152
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,068
IF ANYONE KNOWS THE TRIBE
IT'S ME.

153
00:07:24,103 --> 00:07:26,448
I AM SUCH A PEOPLE PERSON.

154
00:07:26,482 --> 00:07:29,620
AND THAT'S HOW I FIGURED OUT WHO
TO ALIGN MYSELF WITH.

155
00:07:29,655 --> 00:07:33,620
BUT ALSO THE ODDS AREN'T THAT
GREAT TO CHOOSE ONE OUT OF NINE.

156
00:07:33,655 --> 00:07:39,137
IF I DON'T PULL IT OFF, THEN I
LOSE MY VOTE AT THE NEXT TRIBAL.

157
00:07:39,172 --> 00:07:41,137
IN WORST-CASE SCENARIO, I COULD
GET VOTED OUT.

158
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:45,241
FOR YOUR NEXT IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE YOU WILL ALL BE ON

159
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:46,379
SEPARATE STATIONS.

160
00:07:46,413 --> 00:07:48,137
IT WAS ON BOTH SIDES.

161
00:07:48,172 --> 00:07:50,137
THIS IS ALL ABOUT YOUR ARMS.

162
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:53,482
THERE WILL BE A BAR AND WILL
YOU HAVE TO APPLY UPWARD

163
00:07:53,517 --> 00:07:56,862
PRESSURE TO KEEP A BALL FROM
ROLLING.

164
00:07:56,896 --> 00:08:00,413
IT'S NOT SO MUCH STRENGTH AND
ENDURANCE AS IT IS

165
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:00,793
CONCENTRATION.

166
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:01,413
OKAY.

167
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:02,689
YOU HAVE TO BE FOCUSED.

168
00:08:02,724 --> 00:08:10,793
THIS CHALLENGE IS ALSO GOING TO
HAVE AN EAT OR PLAY COMPONENT.

169
00:08:10,827 --> 00:08:13,724
IF YOU SIT OUT THERE WILL BE
FOOD WITHIN PANCAKES, BACON,

170
00:08:13,758 --> 00:08:16,586
HASH BROWNS AND ORANGE JUICE.

171
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,620
BREAKFAST?

172
00:08:17,655 --> 00:08:18,931
BREAKFAST.

173
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,034
SO THERE ARE CERTAINLY GOING
TO BE SOME PEOPLE THAT NO MATTER

174
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:24,137
WHAT, IF THEIR BACKS ARE AGAINST
THE WALL THEY MIGHT SAY I'M

175
00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:26,275
GOING TO COMPETE.

176
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,379
BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT WHICH ONE
YOU YOU THINK MIGHT NOT BE IN IT

177
00:08:30,413 --> 00:08:31,448
TO WIN IT.

178
00:08:31,482 --> 00:08:35,862
DEN HAS NO ENDURANCE SO-AND
HE'S TOLD ME THAT.

179
00:08:35,896 --> 00:08:38,551
DEAN DROPPED HIS THIRD BALL,
HE'S OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

180
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:40,275
THIS IS UNCOMFORTABLE.

181
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,241
DEAN DROPPED.

182
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:44,275
SO I DON'T THINK THAT HE
COULD CHALLENGE.

183
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,379
AND DAN, I THINK DAN'S HUNGRY.

184
00:08:46,413 --> 00:08:51,344
AND I ALSO THINK HE FEELS REALLY
SAFE AND COMFORTABLE, AND JANET

185
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:55,965
AS MUCH AS I WOULD LOVE FOR HER
TO FIGHT FOR THIS.

186
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,827
JANET DROPPED.

187
00:08:56,862 --> 00:09:00,896
I DONE THINK THIS IS HER
CHALLENGE.

188
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:06,137
KARISHMA, HER ABILITY TO FOCUS,
I DON'T SEE IT.

189
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:07,620
KARISHMA, THE FIRST TO DROP.

190
00:09:07,655 --> 00:09:09,896
SO WHICH ONES DO YOU THINK
MIGHT WIN?

191
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:15,448
SO I DEFINITELY THINK NOURA
COULD WIN THIS CHALLENGE.

192
00:09:15,482 --> 00:09:19,206
BECAUSE SHE IS LIKE A YOGI
THROUGH AND THROUGH.

193
00:09:19,241 --> 00:09:22,310
AND HER ABILITY TO FOCUS SOWT OF
THIS WORLD.

194
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:24,310
NOURA WINS IMMUNITY FOR
PURPLE.

195
00:09:24,344 --> 00:09:25,551
WOO.

196
00:09:25,586 --> 00:09:27,758
AND IF THAT IS WHAT THIS
CHALLENGE IS ABOUT, THEN SHE HAS

197
00:09:27,793 --> 00:09:28,655
A REALLY GOOD SHOT.

198
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:31,137
AND SHE'S VEGAN, SO SHE IS NOT
INTO THAT.

199
00:09:31,172 --> 00:09:37,034
AND I ALSO THINK ELIZABETH WILL
WIN.

200
00:09:37,068 --> 00:09:41,034
SHE'S AN A LIMB MEAN, SHE'S AN
AMAZING PERFORMER AT EVERYTHING

201
00:09:41,068 --> 00:09:42,000
CHALLENGE.

202
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:44,137
THAT'S THE WAY TO WORK,
ELIZABETH.

203
00:09:44,172 --> 00:09:47,206
ELIZABETH IS FIRST FOR VOKA.

204
00:09:47,241 --> 00:09:50,103
AND HER ALLIES WERE VOTED OUT
AT THE LAST TWO TRIEBL.

205
00:09:50,137 --> 00:09:51,034
HER NECK IS ON THE LINE.

206
00:09:51,068 --> 00:09:52,241
HER NECK IS ON THE LINE.

207
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:56,034
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD
RISK YOUR VOTE ON?

208
00:09:56,068 --> 00:10:03,068
OH MY GOD.

209
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:11,379
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, WHAT IF
I LET YOU CHOOSE TWO PEOPLE.

210
00:10:11,413 --> 00:10:15,517
SO NOW YOU GOT TWO HORSES IN THE
RACE, BUT IF ONE OF YOUR TWO

211
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:20,034
DOESN'T COME IN, YOU LOSE YOUR
VOTE.

212
00:10:20,068 --> 00:10:24,310
ONE OF THE TWO, IT IS AN
IMMUNITY FOR UP TO TWO TRIBAL

213
00:10:24,344 --> 00:10:25,344
COUNCILS.

214
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:26,827
NOW YOU HAVE GOT-HE JUST GAVE
YOU BETTER ODDS.

215
00:10:26,862 --> 00:10:28,344
I DOUBLED YOUR ODDS.

216
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:30,310
IF YOU PICK TWO, DO YOU THINK
YOU COULD FIGURE IT OUT.

217
00:10:30,344 --> 00:10:31,310
I DO.

218
00:10:31,344 --> 00:10:33,551
AND TEMPT THE OTHER ONES TO
SIT OUT.

219
00:10:33,586 --> 00:10:34,586
YES.

220
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,034
SO YOU HAVE TO TELL US WHAT
YOUR DECISION IS.

221
00:10:38,068 --> 00:10:44,068
I AM GOING TO GO WITH MY
GUTTED AND SAY-MY GUT AND SAY

222
00:10:44,103 --> 00:10:45,206
NOURA AND ELIZABETH.

223
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:48,241
THAT IS WHAT YOU SAID THE
WHOLE TIME, IF YOU GAVE ME

224
00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:51,379
ANOTHER NAME, I WOULD BE
CONCERNED.

225
00:10:51,413 --> 00:10:53,000
SO LET'S GO NOURA.

226
00:10:53,034 --> 00:10:56,241
LET'S GO ELIZABETH.

227
00:10:56,275 --> 00:10:59,517
LAUREN SEEMS TO HAVE A GOOD
GRASS PARAGRAPH ON ALL OF HER

228
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:02,379
TRIBE MATES, THAT IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING, GET A HORSE AND

229
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:03,620
GO WITH IT.

230
00:11:03,655 --> 00:11:05,758
AND THE FACT THAT THERE IS AN
EAT OR PLAY IN THIS CHALLENGE

231
00:11:05,793 --> 00:11:08,241
ONLY HELPS LAUREN.

232
00:11:08,275 --> 00:11:12,862
IF YOU GET IT RIGHT THE IDOL
IS GOING TO BE UNDER THE BIG

233
00:11:12,896 --> 00:11:14,103
ROCK AT TREE.

234
00:11:14,137 --> 00:11:15,310
YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST.

235
00:11:15,344 --> 00:11:16,931
GOOD LUCK.

236
00:11:16,965 --> 00:11:18,172
BYE.

237
00:11:18,206 --> 00:11:20,965
THE MORE PEOPLE SHE CAN GET
TO SIT OUT, THE BETTER HERODS

238
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
GET, AS LONG AS HER HORSES
AREN'T THE ONES GRAIZING.

239
00:11:40,758 --> 00:11:43,241
AS FAR AS YOU KNOW THE-IS
REAL OR FAKE.

240
00:11:43,275 --> 00:11:44,103
IT'S REAL.

241
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:46,275
I'M JUST GOING TO PLAY.

242
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,896
JAMAL GAVE ME THIS THING,
WHEN HE RETURNED FROM ISLAND OF

243
00:11:49,931 --> 00:11:53,620
IDOLS HE PRESENTED A LEGACY
ADVANTAGE TO MYSELF.

244
00:11:53,655 --> 00:12:01,965
THIS ADVANTAGE IS GOING TO GO
TO THE-I-THIS FAKE LEGACY

245
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,413
ADVANTAGE, BUT THIS NOTE HAS NO
POWER.

246
00:12:04,448 --> 00:12:05,448
GET IT OUT OF THE WHICH.

247
00:12:05,482 --> 00:12:07,517
THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO DO,
I'M TIRED OF IT.

248
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,896
IS IT FAKE, IS IT REAL, I
DON'T KNOW.

249
00:12:09,931 --> 00:12:13,896
THE TRIBE DOESN'T KNOW BUT I
THINK IT'S REAL.

250
00:12:13,931 --> 00:12:17,206
IT SAYS THIS SERVES AS AN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

251
00:12:17,241 --> 00:12:23,310
IT CAN ONLY BE PLAYED WITH NINE
PEOPLE LEFT OR SIX PEOPLE LEFT.

252
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:25,137
WE'RE AT NINE RIGHT NOW.

253
00:12:25,172 --> 00:12:30,034
SO WHILE EVERYONE WAS SNOOZING,
I WENT AHEAD AND GOT MY LITTLE

254
00:12:30,068 --> 00:12:33,620
PICASSO ON AND MADE MYSELF A
LITTLE FAKE LEGACY.

255
00:12:33,655 --> 00:12:36,827
THE IDEA HERE IS THIS, KEEP THIS
POTENTIALLY REAL ONE WITH ME,

256
00:12:36,862 --> 00:12:39,724
USE MY FAKE ONE IN THE NEXT
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

257
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,793
DOES IT LOOK EXACTLY, EXACTLY
ALIKE?

258
00:12:42,827 --> 00:12:43,827
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

259
00:12:43,862 --> 00:12:45,344
SO IT IS A BIT RISKY.

260
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:48,793
BUT IF I CAN GET BY WITH THAT,
THIS ONE WILL STILL BE LEFT IN

261
00:12:48,827 --> 00:12:52,655
MY POCKET AND I WILL BE
POTENTIALLY SAFE AT SIX IF IT IS

262
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:53,827
REAL.

263
00:12:53,862 --> 00:12:56,551
I'M EXCITED TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT
AND BE A LITTLE SCHEMEY.

264
00:12:56,586 --> 00:12:59,241
I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN UNDER THE
RADAR.

265
00:12:59,275 --> 00:13:03,068
BUT THIS IS MY CHANCE TO KIND
OF, YOU KNOW, SHAKE THINGS UP A

266
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:16,034
BIT AND GET A LITTLE-GET A
LITTLE SHIFTY WITH IT.

267
00:13:16,068 --> 00:13:16,517
HELLO!

268
00:13:16,551 --> 00:13:17,344
WELCOME, MADAME.

269
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,689
HAVE I NEVER SEEN A SMILE SO
BIG.

270
00:13:19,724 --> 00:13:23,137
WHEN I COME BACK FROM ISLAND
OF THE IDOLS I DO BELIEVE THAT

271
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:24,758
THERE IS WORK TO BE DONE.

272
00:13:24,793 --> 00:13:31,034
I NEED TO CONVINCE MAY TRIBE
TO BASICALLY EAT AT THE NEXT

273
00:13:31,068 --> 00:13:32,206
CHALLENGE.

274
00:13:32,241 --> 00:13:34,241
AND I NEED TO CONVINCE THE
TWO PEOPLE THAT I BET ON,

275
00:13:34,275 --> 00:13:37,551
ELIZABETH AND NOURA THAT THEY
NEED TO COMPETE, WHICH ARE TWO

276
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:41,000
OF MY HORSES IN THE RACE.

277
00:13:41,034 --> 00:13:44,000
SO BASICALLY I KNOW THAT
TOMORROW IS AN IMMUNITY

278
00:13:44,034 --> 00:13:44,689
CHALLENGE.

279
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:46,620
I KNOW WHAT THE CHALLENGE IS.

280
00:13:46,655 --> 00:13:49,482
IT'S THE ONE WHERE YOU HAVE TO
HOLD THE BAR UP AND THERE IS A

281
00:13:49,517 --> 00:13:50,551
BALL ABOVE YOU.

282
00:13:50,586 --> 00:13:53,758
AND IF YOU RELEASE PRESSURE, THE
BALL FALLS.

283
00:13:53,793 --> 00:13:58,172
AND THE TWIST, I GOT TO DECIDE
IF WE MADE IT AN EAT OR PLAY

284
00:13:58,206 --> 00:14:00,000
GAME BECAUSE I KNOW A LOT OF YOU
ARE HUNGRY.

285
00:14:00,034 --> 00:14:03,137
SO GUESS WHAT IT IS.

286
00:14:03,172 --> 00:14:07,551
PANCAKES, ORANGE JUICE, BACON
AND HASH BROWNS.

287
00:14:07,586 --> 00:14:13,620
THE LESSON THAT I LEARNED FROM
ROB AND SANTA IS SITUATIONAL

288
00:14:13,655 --> 00:14:14,241
AWARENESS.

289
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:15,724
IT IS JUST PERFECT FOR ME.

290
00:14:15,758 --> 00:14:17,551
I STUDY PEOPLE, I OBSERVE
PEOPLE.

291
00:14:17,586 --> 00:14:20,655
AND I FEEL CONFIDENT IN WHO IS
GOING TO SIT OUT AND EAT

292
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:23,206
BREAKFAST AND WHO IS GOING TO
COMPETE.

293
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:27,344
IF YOU DROP YOU ARE OUT, YOU
DON'T GET TO EAT.

294
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:31,275
THE ONLY PERSON I PLAN ON BEING
EXACTLY HONEST WITH IS TOMMY,

295
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:37,482
TOMMY IS MY WINGMAN IN THIS
GAME.

296
00:14:37,517 --> 00:14:41,137
BASICALLY, THE-THEY HAVE TO
WIN, IF THEY WIN I GET IMMUNE.

297
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,482
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BET.

298
00:14:42,517 --> 00:14:46,068
BECAUSE THEY BET ON US, WE
NEED TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO.

299
00:14:46,103 --> 00:14:47,931
I SAY WE DE TELL NOBODY.

300
00:14:47,965 --> 00:14:49,724
IN THIS GAME YOU WANT THE
IDOL.

301
00:14:49,758 --> 00:14:53,206
RIGHT NOW I'M LAUREN'S WINGMAN,
I WILL DO WHATEVER I CAN TO MAKE

302
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:55,137
SURE LAUREN GETS THAT IDOL.

303
00:14:55,172 --> 00:14:55,965
OKAY.

304
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,655
NO ONE CAN KNOW ABOUT THAT
IDOL.

305
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:02,000
SO I WANT TO GET AS MANY PEOPLE
I CAN TO NOT PLAY, SO WHAT ARE

306
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:08,137
WE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ALL DAY
LONG RIGHT NOW, PANCAKES, SYRUP,

307
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:09,448
BACON, COFFEE.

308
00:15:09,482 --> 00:15:13,689
THE MORE I TALK ABOUT T THE MORE
LAUREN TALKS ABOUT IT, THE LESS

309
00:15:13,724 --> 00:15:16,758
PEOPLE COMPETE AGAINST OR
ELIZABETH.

310
00:15:16,793 --> 00:15:18,241
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

311
00:15:18,275 --> 00:15:19,965
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT.

312
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,137
IF YOU COULD PICK, WITHOUT
FEELING THE PRESSURE.

313
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:22,931
OH, I WOULD EAT.

314
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:23,827
YOU SHOULD EAT.

315
00:15:23,862 --> 00:15:26,275
I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO
PLAY.

316
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:30,896
BUT IT IS GOING TO BE HARD TO
SMELL THOSE PANCAKES AND BACON.

317
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,172
I'M THINKING BACON, PAN KICKS
AND SYRUP.

318
00:15:34,206 --> 00:15:35,758
I'M EXCITED.

319
00:15:35,793 --> 00:15:40,206
ARE YOU GOING TO PLAY?

320
00:15:40,241 --> 00:15:42,931
MIMOSA IS MY FAVORITE DRINK
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

321
00:15:42,965 --> 00:15:46,241
IF I COULD GO TO A BAR AND ORDER
A DRINK I WOULD ORDER AN MIMOSA,

322
00:15:46,275 --> 00:15:47,655
THAT IS HOW I LOVE IT.

323
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:50,655
THE KEY IS NOT TO FILL UP ON
PANCAKES.

324
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:55,275
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE
CHANCE TO GET VOTED OUT FOR

325
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,517
FRICKING BACON.

326
00:15:56,551 --> 00:15:59,241
ST ALL CARBS, IT DOESN'T
MATTER WHAT YOU EAT I WILL KEEP

327
00:15:59,275 --> 00:15:59,862
GOING.

328
00:15:59,896 --> 00:16:01,137
BACON IS NOT A CARB.

329
00:16:01,172 --> 00:16:04,413
IT IS AS IMPORTANT THAT AS
MANY PEOPLE SIT OUT AND EAT BUT

330
00:16:04,448 --> 00:16:07,793
I NEED TO BE SURE ELIZABETH AND
NOURA COMPETE.

331
00:16:07,827 --> 00:16:11,413
BUT KNOWING NOURA AS A VEGAN,
SHE IS NOT GOING TO WANT TO SIT

332
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:12,379
DOWN AND EAT BREAKFAST.

333
00:16:12,413 --> 00:16:14,000
I THINK I'M GOING TO EAT.

334
00:16:14,034 --> 00:16:15,068
HOW ABOUT YOU.

335
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,379
I AM WILLING TO TAKE ONE FOR
THE TEAM AND PLAY.

336
00:16:17,413 --> 00:16:19,517
YOU WILL LAST A LONG TIME.

337
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:23,551
AND OF COURSE ELIZABETH HER
TWO GREATEST ALLIES WERE VOTED

338
00:16:23,586 --> 00:16:26,034
OUT AND I KNOW SHE WILL FIGHT
TWO AND FAIL TO WIN.

339
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:30,172
NOURA IS GOING TO BE IN THE
ZONE.

340
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:32,517
PEOPLE DO SEEM TO BE BUYING
IT.

341
00:16:32,551 --> 00:16:33,586
BUT JUST GOT TO SEE.

342
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,827
IN IS A HUGE DEAL.

343
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:38,241
THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE MY GAME
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

344
00:16:38,275 --> 00:16:40,034
AND I AM A READY.

345
00:16:40,068 --> 00:16:42,896
I'M READY FOR MY GAME TO BE
ACCELERATED.

346
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:45,862
BRING ON THE BACON AND BRING
ON THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

347
00:16:45,896 --> 00:16:48,620
LET'S DO THIS.

348
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:14,896
COME ON, GUYS.

349
00:17:14,931 --> 00:17:18,000
ALL RIGHT, FIRST THINGS FIRST,
TAKE BACK THE IMMUNITY

350
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:18,517
NECKLACES.

351
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:19,965
COME ON, ELAINE.

352
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,827
REALLY?

353
00:17:20,862 --> 00:17:22,206
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE IT,
JEFF.

354
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,896
IT WON'T BE THE FIRST TIME.

355
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:24,448
THANK YOU.

356
00:17:24,482 --> 00:17:26,724
THIS MAKES ME SAD.

357
00:17:26,758 --> 00:17:28,172
WIN IT AGAIN.

358
00:17:28,206 --> 00:17:30,137
TRUE STORY.

359
00:17:30,172 --> 00:17:30,931
SORRY.

360
00:17:30,965 --> 00:17:34,931
KNOCK ME OUT, I CAN'T WIN
NOTHING.

361
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:39,344
ONCE AGAIN, INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY

362
00:17:39,379 --> 00:17:41,172
IS BACK UP FOR GRABS.

363
00:17:41,206 --> 00:17:45,137
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE YOU ARE
GOING TO PULL UP ON A HANDLE,

364
00:17:45,172 --> 00:17:46,931
PLANTING A BALL BETWEEN A SET OF
JAWS.

365
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:51,551
IF AT ANY POINT YOU LOWER THE
HANDLE, THAT BALL WILL DROP,

366
00:17:51,586 --> 00:17:53,034
YOU'RE OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

367
00:17:53,068 --> 00:17:57,103
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS
IMMUNITY, GUARANTEED A ONE IN

368
00:17:57,137 --> 00:17:59,310
EIGHT SHOT OF GETTING TO THE
END.

369
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:02,586
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL, SOMEBODY
WILL BE VOTED OUT.

00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:08,068
AND IF ON DAY 30 HERE IN FIJI IN

CHOOSE TO SIT OUT, GIVE UP YOUR

372
00:18:11,862 --> 00:18:20,068
SHOT AT IMMUNITY AND INSTEAD
FEAST.

373
00:18:20,103 --> 00:18:26,862
WAIT A MINUTE, I DIDN'T HEAR A
SINGLE REACTION TO PANCAKES,

374
00:18:26,896 --> 00:18:30,896
HASH BROWNS, BACON, I GOT TO
CHECK IN, WAIT A MINUTE, DID WE

00:18:30,931 --> 00:18:32,724
GUESS WRONG S THIS NOT
APPEALING.

376
00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:35,827
THEY MAY HAVE HAD A LITTLE
TIP AS TO WHAT WE WERE GOING TO

377
00:18:35,862 --> 00:18:37,724
BE EATING TODAY.

378
00:18:37,758 --> 00:18:38,482
OH REALLY.

379
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:38,862
YEAH.

00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:44,551
I GOT SOME INFORMATION AND AT
ISLAND OF THE EYE DLOLS AND LET

382
00:18:44,586 --> 00:18:46,310

HAVE BREAKFAST.

383
00:18:46,344 --> 00:18:47,758
YOU STOLE MY THUNDER.

384
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,655
OKAY.

385
00:18:48,689 --> 00:18:49,758
JUST A LITTLE BIT, JUST A
LITTLE BIT.

386
00:18:49,793 --> 00:18:50,965
NOW IT MAKES SENSE.

387
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,793
YEAH.

388
00:18:51,827 --> 00:18:53,413
THIS IS WORTH PLAYING FOR,
RIGHT?

389
00:18:53,448 --> 00:18:54,482
YES, YEAH.

390
00:18:54,517 --> 00:18:57,310
SO BIG DECISION, YOU EITHER
COMPETE OR YOU EAT.

391
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,379
LET'S MAKE IT.

392
00:18:58,413 --> 00:19:01,241
ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE A RED ROCK
AND A YELLOW ROCK.

393
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:03,827
ONE OF EACH.

394
00:19:03,862 --> 00:19:08,379
IF NOURA OR ELIZABETH WIN THE
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, I WIN AN

00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:11,310
IMMUNITY IDOL THAT IS VALID
THROUGH THE NEXT TWO TRIBAL

00:19:11,344 --> 00:19:12,551
COUNCILS.

397
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:15,724
SO AS LONG AS THE TWO WERE TO
STAY IN THE RACE, I'M GOLDEN.

398
00:19:15,758 --> 00:19:19,758
OKAY, RED MEANS YOU WANT TO
COMPETE, YELLOW MEANS YOU WANT

399
00:19:19,793 --> 00:19:20,931
TO EAT.

400
00:19:20,965 --> 00:19:24,482
EVERYBODY REVEAL.

401
00:19:24,517 --> 00:19:27,931
TOMMY GOING TO EAT, DAN'S GOING

00:19:35,448 --> 00:19:39,034
KARISHMA, NOURA AND ELIZABETH
WILL COMPETE.

405
00:19:39,068 --> 00:19:41,965
OH MY GOD, DID WE ACTUALLY
JUST PULL THIS OFF?

406
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:53,034
ALL RIGHT, TAKE YOUR SPOTS,
WE'LL GET STARTED.

407
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:56,172
EVERYBODY'S MADE THEIR DECISION,
CHOOSING TO COMPETE.

408
00:19:56,206 --> 00:19:59,862
KARISHMA, NOURA AN ELIZABETH,
ONLY THREE OF NINE ARE FIGHTING

409
00:19:59,896 --> 00:20:01,034
FOR IMMUNITY.

410
00:20:01,068 --> 00:20:01,896
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

411
00:20:01,931 --> 00:20:03,862
WHEN THE CHALLENGE STARTS YOU
CAN EAT.

412
00:20:03,896 --> 00:20:06,931
WHEN THE CHALLENGE IS OVER, YOU
HAVE TO STOP EATING WHICH MEANS

413
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:10,137
SHOVE AM THOSE LAST FEW BITES.

414
00:20:10,172 --> 00:20:11,344
ENJOY IT GUYS.

415
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:12,551
GOOD LUCK GIRLS.

416
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,793
DO IT.

417
00:20:13,827 --> 00:20:14,206
GOT IT.

418
00:20:14,241 --> 00:20:15,448
WE OWE YOU.

419
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:18,448
ALL RIGHT, PUT YOUR HANDS
UNDERNEATH THAT HANDLE, AND WHEN

420
00:20:18,482 --> 00:20:21,793
I TELL YOU TOO YOU WILL LIFT UP
AND RELEASE YOUR BALL AND THIS

421
00:20:21,827 --> 00:20:22,862
CHALLENGE IS ON.

422
00:20:22,896 --> 00:20:30,517
THREE, TWO, ONE, LIFT UP.

423
00:20:30,551 --> 00:20:33,000
EVERYBODY'S GOOD, START EATING.

424
00:20:33,034 --> 00:20:37,551
THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.

425
00:20:37,586 --> 00:20:43,793
IMMUNITY ON THE LINE 30 DAYS
INTO OUR 39th SEASON.

426
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:47,827
YOU ARE PULLING UP ON THAT
HANDLE, TRYING TO KEEP PRESSURE

427
00:20:47,862 --> 00:20:48,827
ON THAT JAW.

428
00:20:48,862 --> 00:20:51,965
MAKE SURE THAT BALL DOESN'T
START HEADING OUT.

429
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:59,620
WE DID THIS CHALLENGE ON GHOST
ISLAND WITH NEARLY 45 MINUTES.

430
00:20:59,655 --> 00:21:01,689
IT IS A DECEIVING CHALLENGE.

431
00:21:01,724 --> 00:21:03,758
THIS IS ALL ABOUT YOUR ARMS.

432
00:21:03,793 --> 00:21:09,517
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP THAT
PRESSURE.

433
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:12,034
QUICKLY KARISHMA DROPS.

434
00:21:12,068 --> 00:21:13,275
SHE IS OUT.

435
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,275
WE'RE DOWN TO TWO.

436
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:17,482
YOU CAN JOIN THEM, YOU JUST
CAN'T EAT.

437
00:21:17,517 --> 00:21:17,931
OKAY.

438
00:21:17,965 --> 00:21:18,517
I CAN HANDLE IT.

439
00:21:18,551 --> 00:21:19,827
YOU CAN HANDLE WHAT.

440
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,724
SMELLING THE FOOD AND NOT
HAVING ANY FOOD AND FEELING LIKE

441
00:21:22,758 --> 00:21:23,172
-FAILURE.

442
00:21:23,206 --> 00:21:24,655
I CAN HANDLE IT.

443
00:21:24,689 --> 00:21:26,275
I'M STRONGER THAN THIS.

444
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:29,551
WHY ARE YOU FEELING-ARE YOU
ONE OF THE THREE PEOPLE TO STAND

445
00:21:29,586 --> 00:21:32,482
UP FOR THE TEST.

446
00:21:32,517 --> 00:21:35,068
I PROMISED MYSELF I WOULD
ALWAYS TRY NO MATTER WHAT,

447
00:21:35,103 --> 00:21:38,379
BECAUSE MY MIND IS STRONGER THAN
ANYTHING AM BUT WHY IS MY BODY

448
00:21:38,413 --> 00:21:40,586
NOT COOPERATING?

449
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,620
COULD BE 30 DAYS PLAYING
SURVIVOR.

450
00:21:42,655 --> 00:21:46,793
IT WILL DO IT TO THE STRONGEST.

451
00:21:46,827 --> 00:21:50,827
EVERYBODY IS OUT HERE FOR THEIR
OWN JOURNEY, KARISHMA GOING

452
00:21:50,862 --> 00:21:52,827
THROUGH HERS RIGHT NOW.

453
00:21:52,862 --> 00:21:54,724
SIX OTHER PEOPLE, NOT A CARE IN
THE WORLD.

454
00:21:54,758 --> 00:21:56,103
HANG IN THERE, GIRL.

455
00:21:56,137 --> 00:21:57,655
YOU GUYS GOT IT.

456
00:21:57,689 --> 00:21:58,896
ANOTHER HOUR.

457
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:02,655
WE'RE DOWN TO TWO NOW, NOURA
AND ELIZABETH, SIDE-BY-SIDE.

458
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:07,482
ONE WILL WIN IMMUNITY, BE GLAD
THEY GAVE UP THE FOOD.

459
00:22:07,517 --> 00:22:09,482
THE OTHER MAY QUESTION IT.

460
00:22:09,517 --> 00:22:18,241
EITHER WAY, SOMEBODY GOING HOME
TONIGHT.

461
00:22:18,275 --> 00:22:19,965
TWO VERY DIFFERENT STORIES.

462
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,413
TWO PEOPLE COMPETING, SIX PEOPLE
EATING, AND THEY HAVE PUT THEIR

463
00:22:24,448 --> 00:22:33,655
GAME ON THE LINE FOR A BREAKFAST
BOTH WOMEN BATTLING FOR

464
00:22:33,689 --> 00:22:34,517
IMMUNITY.

465
00:22:34,551 --> 00:22:36,758
YOU CAN FEEL THE TENSION ON THAT
BAND.

466
00:22:36,793 --> 00:22:44,379
DON'T LOSE YOUR FOCUS.

467
00:22:44,413 --> 00:22:47,724
AND JUST LIKE THAT, ELIZABETH
DROPS.

468
00:22:47,758 --> 00:22:50,000
OH MY GOD.

469
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:52,655
NOURA WINS INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY AGAIN.

470
00:22:52,689 --> 00:22:56,896
AND NOURA, THE CHALLENGE IS
OVER.

471
00:22:56,931 --> 00:22:57,586
NOURA, YOU WON.

472
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,379
YOU WON, NOURA.

473
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:04,620
I'M PLAYING FOR ALL Y'ALL.

474
00:23:04,655 --> 00:23:06,103
YES, NOURA, GOOD JOB.

475
00:23:06,137 --> 00:23:08,586
I KNOW, UNFORTUNATELY IT
DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.

476
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,000
THE CHALLENGE IS OVER.

477
00:23:10,034 --> 00:23:13,275
SHOVE YOUR LAST BITES IN.

478
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:16,241
NOURA, YOU CAN DROP, IT'S OVER,
YOU'VE WON.

479
00:23:16,275 --> 00:23:23,034
ALL RIGHT, LADIES.

480
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,310
NOURA, ONCE AGAIN, SAFE
TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

481
00:23:25,344 --> 00:23:27,034
CANNOT BE VOTED OUT OF THIS
GAME.

482
00:23:27,068 --> 00:23:30,310
FEELS SO GOOD AND SHOULD, AFTER
30 DAYS, SOMEBODY GOING HOME

483
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:35,413
TONIGHT, GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD
BACK TO CAMP, SEE YOU TONIGHT AT

484
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:36,206
TRIBAL.

485
00:23:36,241 --> 00:23:37,448
THAI SO MUCH.

486
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:39,586
I DECIDED TO EAT AND THAT WAS
PROBABLY ONE OF THE SCARIEST

487
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,103
THINGS I DECIDED TO DO.

488
00:23:41,137 --> 00:23:44,310
I HAVE TO TRUST MY ALLIANCE THAT
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO THROW ME

489
00:23:44,344 --> 00:23:45,551
TO THE WOLVES.

490
00:23:45,586 --> 00:23:47,517
BUT ELIZABETH DROPPING REALLY
SURPRISED ME.

491
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,862
SO NOW I THINK THE SMART
DECISION WOULD BE TO GET RID OF

492
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,896
ELIZABETH BECAUSE SHE'S A
PHYSICAL THREAT.

493
00:24:04,034 --> 00:24:06,551
I
THAT'S CRAZY.

494
00:24:07,034 --> 00:24:14,413
HOLY-THIS IMMUNITY IDOL IS
ONLY GOOD FOR THE NEXT TWO.

495
00:24:14,448 --> 00:24:17,137
SO HERE IS THE THING.

496
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:21,517
RIGHT NOW IT IS EITHER
KARISHMA, THE EASY VOTE, OR

497
00:24:21,551 --> 00:24:24,413
ELIZABETH, THE OLYMPIC ATHLETE
THAT CAN WIN EVERYTHING.

498
00:24:24,448 --> 00:24:25,620
I THINK IT SHOULD BE
ELIZABETH.

499
00:24:25,655 --> 00:24:26,827
OKAY.

500
00:24:26,862 --> 00:24:29,448
WE CAN SPLIT VOTES SO WE
DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ANY

501
00:24:29,482 --> 00:24:31,758
ADVANTAGE ON KARISHMA AND
ELIZABETH.

502
00:24:31,793 --> 00:24:32,965
OKAY.

503
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,482
AT THE CHALLENGE KARISHMA
LASTED 45 SECONDS, YOU CAN GET

504
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:36,862
HER OUT WHENEVER YOU WANT.

505
00:24:36,896 --> 00:24:40,620
BUT ELIZABETH CAN GO ON AN
IMMUNITY RUN AT ANY TIME.

506
00:24:40,655 --> 00:24:42,379
I THINK WE HAVE TO DO
ELIZABETH.

507
00:24:42,413 --> 00:24:45,034
WHY WOULD I VOTE OUT SOMEONE
THAT I CAN EASILY BEAT AT THE

508
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:51,862
END, WHERE YOU CAN TAKE A SHOT
AT ELIZABETH WHILE YOU CAN.

509
00:24:51,896 --> 00:24:56,310
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING,
RIGHT?

510
00:24:56,344 --> 00:24:56,896
RIGHT?

511
00:24:56,931 --> 00:24:58,206
ARE YOU OKAY WITH IT?

512
00:24:58,241 --> 00:24:59,241
YEAH, I'M GOOD.

513
00:24:59,275 --> 00:25:01,793
IF I HAD MY WAY I WANT
KARISHMA TO GO HOME.

514
00:25:01,827 --> 00:25:05,137
SHE IS HE'S THE KARISHMA WITH
NINE LIVES, SHE'S ALMOST BEEN

515
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:06,931
VOTED OUT ABOUT FIVE OR SIX
TIMES.

516
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:10,137
BUT IF MY ALLIANCE DECIDES
ELIZABETH IS NEXT, I CAN'T SHOOT

517
00:25:10,172 --> 00:25:13,793
MYSELF IN THE FOOT JUST TO SAVE
HER BECAUSE IT IS TOO LATE FOR

518
00:25:13,827 --> 00:25:17,172
THAT I DON'T WANT TO DAMAGE MY
OWN GAME TO KEEP HER IN.

519
00:25:17,206 --> 00:25:24,931
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN, MIKE
LIKE, A WEIRD SPOT WHERE.

520
00:25:24,965 --> 00:25:26,689
SORT OF FLOATING RIGHT NOW.

521
00:25:26,724 --> 00:25:28,103
HOPING THAT I JUST DON'T GO
HOME TONIGHT.

522
00:25:28,137 --> 00:25:29,931
I WAS JUST UPSET AT THE
CHALLENGE.

523
00:25:29,965 --> 00:25:31,689
WE SHOULD HAVE SHOWED DOWN FOR
LIKE 30 MINUTES.

524
00:25:31,724 --> 00:25:33,137
I KNOW, I KNOW.

525
00:25:33,172 --> 00:25:36,793
SO AT TODAY'S CHALLENGE, I
BLEW IT, MY NAME HAS BEEN ON THE

526
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:40,586
CHOPPING BLOCK THE LAST THREE
DAYS AN ST A VERY EASY

527
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,689
OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF THESE
PEOPLE TO TAKE A BIG THREAT LIKE

528
00:25:43,724 --> 00:25:44,724
MYSELF OUT OF THIS GAME.

529
00:25:44,758 --> 00:25:46,448
I JUST HOPE I WAKE UP HERE
TOMORROW MORNING.

530
00:25:46,482 --> 00:25:48,137
YOU ARE, I'M TELLING YOU.

531
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:53,034
I KNOW, BUT-KARISHMA
PLAYED-AND SHE WAS TOLD TO

532
00:25:53,068 --> 00:25:56,586
VOTE FOR ME AND I'M THE ONE VOTE
THAT GOES HOME.

533
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,655
I DON'T HAVE AN IDOL.

534
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:00,137
I DON'T HAVE AN IMMUNITY
NECKLACE.

535
00:26:00,172 --> 00:26:03,931
I'M JUST PRAYING TO THE SURVIVOR
GODS THAT KARISHMA DOES NOT HAVE

536
00:26:03,965 --> 00:26:06,137
AN IDOL TONIGHT.

537
00:26:06,172 --> 00:26:08,034
YOU OKAY, KARISHMA?

538
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:10,068
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY
PHYSICAL.

539
00:26:10,103 --> 00:26:13,206
IT'S EMOTIONAL THAT IS MAKING ME
DIZZY.

540
00:26:13,241 --> 00:26:15,034
JUST DOWN IT BECAUSE YOU WILL
FEEL BETTER.

541
00:26:15,068 --> 00:26:20,172
WE GET BACK TO THE CAMP AND
KARISHMA IS JUST LIKE-ON THE

542
00:26:20,206 --> 00:26:22,896
HAMMOCK AND I'M TELLING HER TO
DRINK HER WATER BECAUSE I KNOW

543
00:26:22,931 --> 00:26:25,000
SHE IS NOT IN GREAT SHAPE.

544
00:26:25,034 --> 00:26:29,068
LITERALLY I SCOOP UP HER BAG TO
TAKE IT TO THE BEACH AND SAY

545
00:26:29,103 --> 00:26:31,896
ELIZABETH, COME WITH ME.

546
00:26:31,931 --> 00:26:34,137
WE GO THROUGH IT TO SEE IF
WILL IS ANYTHING THERE THERE.

547
00:26:34,172 --> 00:26:37,517
A CRUMPLED UPNOTE, TWO THINGS
THAT HAVE SHELLS ON THEM.

548
00:26:37,551 --> 00:26:39,379
WE DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT
THEM.

549
00:26:39,413 --> 00:26:41,482
ELIZABETH IS LIKE THOSE ARE
BOTH NOTHING.

550
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,965
I HAVE SEEN FOR MY OWN EYES SHE
DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING.

551
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,586
FOR ME THE REACTION OF ELIZABETH
AND KARISHMA IS ENOUGH FOR ME TO

552
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:56,137
KNOW WITH MY OWN GUT FEELING
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING.

553
00:26:56,172 --> 00:26:59,172
I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT
ELIZABETH HAS AN IDOL.

554
00:26:59,206 --> 00:27:00,586
LET ME TELL YOU WHY.

555
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,137
WE'RE SPLITTING IT.

556
00:27:02,172 --> 00:27:03,241
BETWEEN TWO.

557
00:27:03,275 --> 00:27:08,310
YOU SHOULD THROW YOUR VOTE
AND TAKE OUT JANET.

558
00:27:08,344 --> 00:27:08,655
OKAY.

559
00:27:08,689 --> 00:27:09,965
>>.

560
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,034
ELIZABETH SON THE OUTS BUT IF
SOMETHING CRAZY HAPPENS TONIGHT

561
00:27:13,068 --> 00:27:14,413
THEN WE'RE SPLITTING THE VOTE.

562
00:27:14,448 --> 00:27:17,655
IT IS REALLY ELIZABETH BUT WITH
KARISHMA, BUT KARISHMA IS

563
00:27:17,689 --> 00:27:20,758
SUPPOSED TO THINK IT IS A SPLIT
BETWEEN JANUARY ELEVATOR AND

564
00:27:20,793 --> 00:27:21,758
ELIZABETH.

565
00:27:21,793 --> 00:27:22,931
SHE'S LIKE OH, OKAY.

566
00:27:22,965 --> 00:27:26,241
AND SHE GETS UP, IMMEDIATELY
WALKS OVER TO ELIZABETH, BUT

567
00:27:26,275 --> 00:27:34,482
THEN LAUREN COMES TO SIT WITH ME
AND SHE WATCHES KARISHMA TALK TO

568
00:27:34,517 --> 00:27:39,655
ELIZABETH.

569
00:27:39,689 --> 00:27:42,379
HE'S CALLING THE SHOTS.

570
00:27:42,413 --> 00:27:42,965
UH-HUH.

571
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,620
HE WANTS YOU OUT SO BAD.

572
00:27:45,655 --> 00:27:47,965
KARISHMA DOES NOT HAVE ALLIES
IN THIS GAME.

573
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,379
SO SHE IS A FREE AGENT AND THOSE
PEOPLE ALWAYS ARE DANGEROUS

574
00:27:51,413 --> 00:27:53,931
BECAUSE THEY CAN GO EITHER WAY.

575
00:27:53,965 --> 00:27:55,344
I'M VERY OBSERVANT.

576
00:27:55,379 --> 00:27:56,758
I AM READING LIPS.

577
00:27:56,793 --> 00:27:57,827
I'M PICKING UP VIBES.

578
00:27:57,862 --> 00:28:02,206
I'M LOOKING AT EYE CONTACT.

579
00:28:02,241 --> 00:28:04,482
SHE'S-SHE IS GOING HOME.

580
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:05,068
YEAH.

581
00:28:05,103 --> 00:28:08,275
GO OVER THERE.

582
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,517
NO.

583
00:28:09,551 --> 00:28:15,241
IT IS ME, YOU, JANET AND
ELAINE, IF WE COME TOGETHER AND

584
00:28:15,275 --> 00:28:16,896
ALL VOTE DAN.

585
00:28:16,931 --> 00:28:19,793
>>-I GO OVER THERE AND SAY I
HEARD MY NAME.

586
00:28:19,827 --> 00:28:21,655
DO IT, DO IT, DO IT PLEASE.

587
00:28:21,689 --> 00:28:23,896
LAUREN SEES HER LIPS SAY DAN
IS AFTER YOU.

588
00:28:23,931 --> 00:28:27,206
SO IT IS JUST, IT IS MADDENING.

589
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:30,034
YOU SAID DAN.

590
00:28:30,068 --> 00:28:30,931
JAN.

591
00:28:30,965 --> 00:28:34,137
I DID HERE DAN, I THOUGHT I
HEARD DAN.

592
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:35,827
NO, I AM TALKING TO ELIZABETH
ABOUT IT.

593
00:28:35,862 --> 00:28:38,034
I THOUGHT WE ALREADY TALKED
ABOUT THAT.

594
00:28:38,068 --> 00:28:40,413
I KNOW, I WAS TALKING TO HER
ABOUT IT.

595
00:28:40,448 --> 00:28:43,413
THAT'S COOL, ABSOLUTELY.

596
00:28:43,448 --> 00:28:44,310
100 PERCENT.

597
00:28:44,344 --> 00:28:46,379
I DIDN'T MEAN TO-I THOUGHT I
HEARD DAN.

598
00:28:46,413 --> 00:28:47,586
NO, YOU CAN STAY.

599
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:51,034
I JUST WANTED TO JUST TALK TO
HER ABOUT HER THOUGHTS ABOUT

600
00:28:51,068 --> 00:28:52,379
JANET, THAT IS ALL.

601
00:28:52,413 --> 00:28:53,655
YEAH.

602
00:28:53,689 --> 00:28:56,034
KARISHMA IS DOING EVERYTHING
WRONG YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO DO.

603
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,482
THAT WAS IT FOR ME.

604
00:28:57,517 --> 00:29:01,137
I FEEL LIKE WE CAN'T ALLOW
KARISHMA TO GO ANY FURTHER.

605
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:04,448
BUT IT MIGHT BE TOO LATE TO
WORRY ABOUT SWITCHING UP AND

606
00:29:04,482 --> 00:29:06,551
COMPLICATING A VOTE, ESPECIALLY
AT THIS POINT.

607
00:29:06,586 --> 00:29:09,448
COULD YOU PLEASE GET RID OF
HER.

608
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:09,965
YEAH.

609
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
CAN WE COME BACK.

610
00:29:12,034 --> 00:29:15,655
I AGREE WITH DAN ABOUT
KARISHMA, SO IN MY MIND IT MAKES

611
00:29:15,689 --> 00:29:16,896
COMPLETE SENSE.

612
00:29:16,931 --> 00:29:20,793
I WAS UNDER A LITTLE STRESS
SEEING THEY GO TO ARMY ASSEMBLE

613
00:29:20,827 --> 00:29:24,344
BUT IF THERE ARE PEOPLE ON BOARD
TO DISASSEMBLE IT BEFORE IT GETS

614
00:29:24,379 --> 00:29:29,275
ROLLING, IT IS MUSIC TO MY EARS
AND I'M HOPING KARISHMA IS THE

615
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,068
VOTE THAT IS GOING HOME TONIGHT.

616
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:31,896
NOW HE'S GOING TO FREAK OUT.

617
00:29:31,931 --> 00:29:32,758
OH YEAH.

618
00:29:32,793 --> 00:29:34,000
I WAS ABSOLUTELY TALKING
ABOUT DAN.

619
00:29:34,034 --> 00:29:38,172
BUT DAN HAS NO RIGHT TO TELL ME
I AM NOT ALLOWED TO TALK TO

620
00:29:38,206 --> 00:29:39,655
ELIZABETH OR I NEED BABYSITTING.

621
00:29:39,689 --> 00:29:41,344
THAT PISS ME OFF.

622
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:44,034
HOWEVER, EVEN THOUGH I WOULD
HADE TO LEAVE ELIZABETH BECAUSE

623
00:29:44,068 --> 00:29:46,965
HE COULD HAVE BEEN A NUMBER TO
MAKE A BIG MOVE FOR ME, AT THIS

624
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,551
POINT IN TIME, I FEEL LIKE ME
VOTING DIFFERENTLY IS NOT GOING

625
00:29:50,586 --> 00:29:52,034
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

626
00:29:52,068 --> 00:29:55,862
I HAVE THE IMMUNITY IDOL SITTING
IN MY POCKET AND NOBODY KNOWS

627
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:56,655
ABOUT IT.

628
00:29:56,689 --> 00:30:01,620
NOW HERE IS THE ISSUE THAT I
HAVE.

629
00:30:01,655 --> 00:30:07,862
PLAYING IT CORRECTLY, AND MAKING
IT COUNT.

630
00:30:07,896 --> 00:30:10,448
I HAVE TO WEIGH THAT AGAINST
POSSIBLY BEING VOTED OUT WITH AN

631
00:30:10,482 --> 00:30:14,965
IDOL IN MY POCKET.

632
00:30:25,827 --> 00:30:32,551
NOURA, NOURA GOT IMMUNITY.

633
00:30:32,586 --> 00:30:42,586
NOW BRINGING THE MEMBERS OF
OUR JURY.

634
00:30:42,586 --> 00:30:47,586
NOW BRINGING THE MEMBERS OF
OUR JURY.

635
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:52,000
ALL RIGHT, SO WITH TODAY'S
CHALLENGE, THE TWIST WAS IF YOU

636
00:30:52,034 --> 00:30:55,413
FELT COMFORTABLE YOU COULD OPT
TO SIT OUT, NOT COMPETE AND

637
00:30:55,448 --> 00:30:56,620
INSTEAD EAT.

638
00:30:56,655 --> 00:31:01,000
SIX PEOPLE CHOTION TO EAT,
LEAVING US WITH NOURA, ELIZABETH

639
00:31:01,034 --> 00:31:04,620
AND KARISHMA AS THE ONLY THREE
PEOPLE COMPETING.

640
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:07,034
ELIZABETH, WHAT WAS THE CENTRAL
REASON THAT YOU COMPETED.

641
00:31:07,068 --> 00:31:10,379
WELL, JUST THE FACT THAT I
LOST MY MAIN ALLIANCE, THEY'RE

642
00:31:10,413 --> 00:31:11,620
SITTING OVER THERE.

643
00:31:11,655 --> 00:31:14,758
AND YOU KNOW, I WAS HOPING TO
HAVE A GOOD SHOWDOWN TODAY AND

644
00:31:14,793 --> 00:31:17,517
EVERYBODY COULD EAT WHILE WE
WERE PLAYING BUT MY MAIN REASON

645
00:31:17,551 --> 00:31:19,413
WAS TO WIN IMMUNITY.

646
00:31:19,448 --> 00:31:23,034
HOW ABOUT YOU, KARISHMA.

647
00:31:23,068 --> 00:31:26,724
MINE WAS A SECRETARY ET, I
KNEW I WAS AT THE BOTTOM, TWIEB

648
00:31:26,758 --> 00:31:29,758
TRIBAL COUNSELLITY AFTER TRIBAL
I'M ALWAYS AT RISK OF GOING

649
00:31:29,793 --> 00:31:32,965
HOME, BUT ALSO FOR ME I WANTED
TO CHALLENGE MYSELF.

650
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,724
I WANTED TO SEE WHAT I WAS MADE
OF AND TRY MY HARDEST AND I FELT

651
00:31:36,758 --> 00:31:39,724
THIS WAS AS GOOD A TIME AS ANY.

652
00:31:39,758 --> 00:31:43,137
NOURA, ARE YOU THE SEVEN THAT
OPTED TO HELP THE SIX EAT OR ARE

653
00:31:43,172 --> 00:31:46,620
YOU WITH ELIZABETH AND KARISHMA
THE THREE ON THE OUT?

654
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:50,310
I BELIEVE-I FEEL STRONGLY,
ACTUALLY, SO I'M NOT GOING TO

655
00:31:50,344 --> 00:31:51,931
SAY IT LIGHTLY.

656
00:31:51,965 --> 00:31:55,172
I FEEL THAT I HAVE A VERY GOOD
FOOTING IN THE GAME.

657
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:58,034
AND BECAUSE OF THAT, I WAS
WILLING TO STEP UP TO MAKE SURE

658
00:31:58,068 --> 00:31:59,241
THAT MY TRIBE COULD EAT.

659
00:31:59,275 --> 00:32:01,586
SO I CHOSE TO PLAY.

660
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,724
DAN, SO WITH SIX PEOPLE
SITTING OUT DOES THAT IMPLY WHAT

661
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:09,206
IT WOULD APPEAR TO WHICH IS SIX
PEOPLE ARE NOT WORRIED TONIGHT.

662
00:32:09,241 --> 00:32:11,931
AND I THINK THE CORE ALLIANCE
AS IT GETS STRONGER THAT LINE IN

663
00:32:11,965 --> 00:32:14,551
THE SAND GETS DEEPER AND IT
BECOMES LIKE A TRENCH.

664
00:32:14,586 --> 00:32:17,482
AND IF SOMEONE IS ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THAT LINE STRKS WAY TOO

665
00:32:17,517 --> 00:32:20,000
MUCH ENERGY TO DRAG SOMEONE
THROUGH THE SAND OVER TO YOUR

666
00:32:20,034 --> 00:32:21,275
SIDE.

667
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:24,379
BUT ALSO I JUST WANT TO POINT
OUT THAT THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL

668
00:32:24,413 --> 00:32:25,586
GAME.

669
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,344
AND SO YEAH, THERE MIGHT BE SIX
PEOPLE OR SEVEN PEOPLE OR

670
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,655
WHATEVER ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF A
TRENCH BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, IT MAY

671
00:32:31,689 --> 00:32:35,172
JUST BE SWB ON YOUR SIDE OF THAT
TRENCH WHO SLIT YOUR THROAT

672
00:32:35,206 --> 00:32:40,137
BEFORE YOU WOKE UP AND THOUGHT
TO SPLIT THEIRS.

673
00:32:40,172 --> 00:32:43,344
TOMMY S THIS SORT OF LIKE IF
YOU ARE IN AN INDIE RACE AND YOU

674
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:46,965
HAVE TO DECIDE AT WHAT POINT DO
I JUST PUT MY FOOT ALL THE WAY

675
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,310
ON THE PETAL AND I'M JUST GOING
FOR BROKE NOW.

676
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:51,103
YEAH, EXACTLY.

677
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:52,172
THIS IS THE TIME.

678
00:32:52,206 --> 00:32:55,827
SOME PEOPLE NEEDED THAT PIT STOP
AT 30 TO FUEL UP.

679
00:32:55,862 --> 00:32:58,448
WHERE SOME OTHERS WERE SAYING I
DON'T NEED THAT FUEL.

680
00:32:58,482 --> 00:33:02,448
I CAN EAT IN TEN DAYS AND
HOPEFULLY MY TIRES DON'T BURN

681
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:04,931
OUT ON THE WAY.

682
00:33:04,965 --> 00:33:07,034
DEAN, THE PIT STOP, DID THAT
FACTOR IN FOR YOU.

683
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:10,275
I WAS IN A PECULIAR
SITUATION, AS YOU WILL SEE LATER

684
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,586
TONIGHT.

685
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,827
I HAVE A LITTLE LEGACY ADVANTAGE
THAT EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT, THAT

686
00:33:12,862 --> 00:33:15,103
WAS GIFTED TO ME FROM SOMEONE
OVER THERE.

687
00:33:15,137 --> 00:33:17,827
I SO I FELT IN A PRETTY
COMFORTABLE SITUATION.

688
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:21,896
SO YOUR CHOICE WAS IN SOME
SENSE A FREEBY.

689
00:33:21,931 --> 00:33:23,034
YES.

690
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:26,827
LAUREN, HOW IMPORTANT IS IT
TO NAVIGATE AND MANAGE

691
00:33:26,862 --> 00:33:30,310
RELATIONSHIPS THAT MAY OR MAY
NOT BE ON THE SIDE OF THE TRENCH

692
00:33:30,344 --> 00:33:33,655
AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT LIKE MAYBE
ELIZABETH, SHE DOESN'T SEEM

693
00:33:33,689 --> 00:33:35,965
CERTAIN WHERE SHE FITS.

694
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,482
ST SUPERIMPORTANT TO
NAVIGATE.

695
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:42,896
LIKE YOU SAID OR TOMMY SAID,
SOMEONE SAID, IT IS DAY 30, WHAT

696
00:33:42,931 --> 00:33:45,517
WAS I SAYING?

697
00:33:45,551 --> 00:33:49,000
YEAH, IT IS SUPERIMPORTANT TO
TRY TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THESE

698
00:33:49,034 --> 00:33:50,241
RELATIONSHIPS.

699
00:33:50,275 --> 00:33:55,896
THE PROBLEM IS, EVERYBODY HAS
THEIR OWN PLAN, A, B, C, D, E,

700
00:33:55,931 --> 00:34:02,034
F, G, H, I, J, LMT THEY THINK
THIS WILL BE A VERY EASY TRIEBL,

701
00:34:02,068 --> 00:34:05,724
AND I THAT I IS VERY NAIVE,
TRIBAL IS NEVER EASY.

702
00:34:05,758 --> 00:34:07,758
KARISHMA, WHAT DOES AN EASY
TRIBAL MEAN.

703
00:34:07,793 --> 00:34:11,034
AN EASY TRIBAL MEANS EVERYONE
HAS NODDED THEIR HEAD.

704
00:34:11,068 --> 00:34:14,689
BUT WE LOOK AT ALL THE BLIND
SIDES THAT HAVE HAPPENED

705
00:34:14,724 --> 00:34:15,758
ALREADY.

706
00:34:15,793 --> 00:34:19,689
IT'S NEVER AS SIMPLE AS EASY
TRIBAL, EVERYBODY IN?

707
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,896
TOMMY, WHY ARE EASY TRIBALS
SO HARD TO PULL OFF?

708
00:34:22,931 --> 00:34:26,172
WHEN I ASKED MY GIRLFRIEND
WHERE DOES SHE WANT TO EAT, THAT

709
00:34:26,206 --> 00:34:28,275
IS ONE PERSON AND WE CAN'T
FIGURE IT OUT.

710
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:31,620
SO NOW TRY TO GET EIGHT PEOPLE
TO AGREE ON THEIR FAVORITE

711
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:33,448
RESTAURANT OR THEIR FAVORITE
PERSON.

712
00:34:33,482 --> 00:34:39,172
SO NOTHING IS I, EVEN OUT OF
THIS GAME TO CHOOSE ONE PERSON

713
00:34:39,206 --> 00:34:40,965
OR ONE THING.

714
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,551
ELAINE, YOU HAD A PRETTY BIG
REACTION.

715
00:34:42,586 --> 00:34:44,965
MY PERSONAL OPINION IS YOU
HAVE TO PICK A CORE AND ROW WITH

716
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,551
THOSE PEOPLE, PERIOD.

717
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:51,000
IF YOU SWAP BACK AND FORTH
BETWEEN ALL THOSE PEOPLE, AIN'T

718
00:34:51,034 --> 00:34:54,344
NOBODY GOING TO TRUTHS YOU, SO
WHO THE HELL IS GOING TO TAKE

719
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:57,034
YOU TO THE NEXT STEP, I'M
BANKING ON THE RELATIONSHIP WITH

720
00:34:57,068 --> 00:34:59,793
THESE INDIVIDUALS I CALL MY
CORE, AND MI GOING TO ROW WITH

721
00:34:59,827 --> 00:35:04,827
THEM OR I'M GOING TO ROW HOME,
STORY.

722
00:35:04,862 --> 00:35:06,793
-SORRY.

723
00:35:06,827 --> 00:35:10,586
SO ELIZABETH MAY NOT BE THE
FIRST CHOICE FOR TO YOU GO IF

724
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,551
SHOW SAY SHOW ROWS WITH HER
CORE, BUT IF YOU FIND THE RIGHT

725
00:35:13,586 --> 00:35:15,724
PERSON WHO MIGHT THINK
DIFFERENTLY, WHO KNOWS.

726
00:35:15,758 --> 00:35:16,793
OH, ABSOLUTELY.

727
00:35:16,827 --> 00:35:18,344
AND YOU HAVE TO PLAY AS WHO YOU
ARE.

728
00:35:18,379 --> 00:35:20,172
AND FOR ME I'M A LOYAL PLAYER.

729
00:35:20,206 --> 00:35:25,310
IF I PLEDGE YOU MY A A LEGANCE,
I WILL BE WITH YOU FOR AS LONG

730
00:35:25,344 --> 00:35:28,655
AS YOU WANT ME, BUT TO THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE COIN IT IS FLUID AND

731
00:35:28,689 --> 00:35:32,137
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS CHANGING THEIR
MINDS AND THEIR AGENDAS AND YOU

732
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:33,931
DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU FALL IN
THEIR GAME.

733
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,379
THEY COULD BE TELLING YOU ONE
THING BUT IT IS COMPLETELY

734
00:35:36,413 --> 00:35:37,551
OPPOSITE FOR ANOTHER PERSON.

735
00:35:37,586 --> 00:35:43,620
ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME TO
VOAVMENT ELAINE, YOU ARE UP.

736
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:47,551
ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME TO
VOAVMENT ELAINE, YOU ARE UP.

737
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:25,241
I WILL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

738
00:36:25,241 --> 00:36:31,068
I WILL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

739
00:36:31,103 --> 00:36:39,862
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

740
00:36:39,896 --> 00:36:44,724
SO THIS IS A LEGACY ADVANTAGE.

741
00:36:44,758 --> 00:36:47,758
I AM PLAYING IT FOR MYSELF.

742
00:36:47,793 --> 00:36:50,551
THANK YOU.

743
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:54,655
OKAY.

744
00:36:54,689 --> 00:37:00,517
THIS IS NOT AN ADVANTAGE AND
HAS ABSOLUTELY NO POWER.

745
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,896
ANY VOTES CAST FOR DEAN WILL
STILL COUNT.

746
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:04,448
OKAY.

747
00:37:04,482 --> 00:37:10,448
I WILL READ THE VOTES.

748
00:37:10,482 --> 00:37:17,862
JEFF.

749
00:37:17,896 --> 00:37:21,413
THERE IS SOME INSURANCE
BECAUSE I AM CERTAINLY ON THE

750
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:22,758
WRONG SIDE OF THE TRENCH.

751
00:37:22,793 --> 00:37:31,000
AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN START
FILLING THAT TRENCH IN.

752
00:37:31,034 --> 00:37:34,137
THIS IS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL.

753
00:37:34,172 --> 00:37:40,000
ANY VOTE ITS CAST FOR KARISHMA
WILL NOT COUNT.

754
00:37:40,034 --> 00:37:50,413
JEFF THERE IS ONE MORE.

755
00:37:50,448 --> 00:37:58,310
I'M NOT GOING HOME EITHER.

756
00:37:58,344 --> 00:38:02,655
THIS IS ALSO A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

757
00:38:02,689 --> 00:38:05,241
ANY VOTES CAST FOR LAUREN WILL
NOT COUNT.

758
00:38:05,275 --> 00:38:09,655
I WILL READ THE VOTES.

759
00:38:09,689 --> 00:38:14,931
FIRST VOTE, KARISHMA, DOES NOT
COUNT.

760
00:38:14,965 --> 00:38:18,758
KARISHMA, DOES NOT COUNT.

761
00:38:18,793 --> 00:38:23,275
KARISHMA, DOES NOT COUNT.

762
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:27,551
KARISHMA, DOES NOT COUNT.

763
00:38:27,586 --> 00:38:32,827
KARISHMA, DOES NOT COUNT.

764
00:38:32,862 --> 00:38:36,034
KARISHMA, DOES NOT COUNT.

765
00:38:36,068 --> 00:38:43,241
KARISHMA, DOES NOT COUNT.

766
00:38:43,275 --> 00:38:45,241
JANET, ONE VOTE JANET.

767
00:38:45,275 --> 00:38:53,448
ONE VOTE LEFT.

768
00:38:53,482 --> 00:38:53,862
ELIZABETH.

769
00:38:53,896 --> 00:39:00,241
WE HAVE A TIE.

770
00:39:00,275 --> 00:39:02,344
SO HERE'S WHAT IS GOING TO
HAPPEN.

771
00:39:02,379 --> 00:39:05,172
WE ARE GOING TO REVOTE, JANET
AND ELIZABETH, WILL YOU NOT

772
00:39:05,206 --> 00:39:08,241
VOTE, EVERYBODY ELSE, YOU CAN
ONLY VOTE FOR JANET OR

773
00:39:08,275 --> 00:39:09,241
ELIZABETH.

774
00:39:09,275 --> 00:39:14,172
ELAINE, ARE YOU UP, WILL YOU
COME GRAB THE UN.

775
00:39:14,206 --> 00:39:21,862
THIS IS SO TOUGH.

776
00:39:21,896 --> 00:39:36,310
OH, THIS SUCKS SO BAD.

777
00:39:36,344 --> 00:39:45,137
I WILL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

778
00:39:45,172 --> 00:39:49,310
I WILL READ THE VOTES.

779
00:39:49,344 --> 00:39:55,206
FIRST VOTES, ELIZABETH.

780
00:39:55,241 --> 00:40:00,482
ELIZABETH, TWO VOTES ELIZABETH.

781
00:40:00,517 --> 00:40:01,034
ELIZABETH.

782
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:05,827
THREE VOTES ELIZABETH.

783
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:09,103
129 PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE
6th MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

784
00:40:09,137 --> 00:40:10,137
ELIZABETH, THAT'S FOUR.

785
00:40:10,172 --> 00:40:10,862
THAT'S ENOUGH.

786
00:40:10,896 --> 00:40:14,517
YOU NEED TO BINGE ME YOUR TORCH.

787
00:40:14,551 --> 00:40:21,103
ALL WELL AND GOOD UNTIL
SOMEONE PLAYS AN IDOL.

788
00:40:21,137 --> 00:40:25,413
ELIZABETH, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

789
00:40:25,448 --> 00:40:27,827
I AM TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

790
00:40:27,862 --> 00:40:28,310
BYE.

791
00:40:28,344 --> 00:40:29,000
GOOD LUCK.

792
00:40:29,034 --> 00:40:29,758
LOVE YOU.

793
00:40:29,793 --> 00:40:36,241
LOVE YOU.

794
00:40:36,275 --> 00:40:38,586
AND THEN THERE WERE EIGHT.

795
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,448
WELL, ONE THING'S FOR SURE,
IT WASN'T AN EASY VOTE.

796
00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:44,000
GRAB YOUR TORCH, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

797
00:40:44,034 --> 00:40:46,655
GOOD NIGHT.

798
00:40:47,137 --> 00:40:53,000

801
00:40:59,275 --> 00:41:01,137
STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

802
00:41:04,344 --> 00:41:05,482
NEXT TIME ON SURVIVOR.

803
00:41:05,517 --> 00:41:08,965
IN AN UNPREDICTABLE GAME.

804
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,551
THIS IS A BREAK I'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR.

805
00:41:11,586 --> 00:41:12,758
THERE IS NO ONE TO TRUST.

806
00:41:12,793 --> 00:41:15,275
I AM HONEST AND LOYAL TO A
FAULT.

807
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:17,965
NOURA IS SUCH A FRUIT LOOP.

808
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,758
EXCEPTED FAMILY.

809
00:41:18,793 --> 00:41:26,103
TIME FOR SOME LOVE.

810
00:41:26,137 --> 00:41:29,482
I MADE A MILLION DOLLAR
MISTAKE AT THE CHALLENGE.

811
00:41:29,517 --> 00:41:32,137
BUT AS AN OLYMPIAN I GAVE IT MY
ALL.

812
00:41:32,172 --> 00:41:34,862
ANY TIME YOU GET TO PLAY
SURVIVOR AND MAKE IT 30 DAYS,

813
00:41:34,896 --> 00:41:36,620
THAT IN ITSELF IS AN INCREDIBLE
FEET.

814
00:41:36,655 --> 00:41:39,655
SO I THINK IN MY OWN WAY HAVE I
GOTTEN A LITTLE BIT OF GOLD

815
00:41:39,689 --> 00:41:42,448
INSIDE OF ME JUST FOR DOING THIS
ENTIRE EXPERIENCE.

816
00:41:42,482 --> 00:41:46,137
SO BITTERSWEET RIGHT NOW.
