1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:03,128
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR."

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:06,756
AFTER 18 DAYS, RECENT EVENTS
CENTERED ON THREE PEOPLE--

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,092
NAONKA, SHE WAS AN ANGRY
AND VINDICTIVE TRIBEMATE.

4
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,094
>> WHY ARE YOU RAISING YOUR
VOICE AT ME?

5
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,429
I CAN GET LOUD, TOO.

6
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,097
>> Jeff: SHE HAD A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL

7
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,933
AND CONTROL OF THE ENTIRE ESPADA
TRIBE.

8
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:18,101
NAONKA AND HER ALLY CHASE HAD
DECIDED

9
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,270
ALINA WAS THE NEXT TO GO.

10
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,230
NEXT THING YOU KNOW
YOU GONNA BE WALKING AWAY

11
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:23,773
AND YOUR TORCH IS PUT OUT.

12
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,276
MARTY, BEFORE THE SWITCH, HE WAS
THE MOST POWERFUL

13
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,446
AND OUTSPOKEN PLAYER ON HIS
TRIBE.

14
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,739
>> DO NOT MESS AROUND WITH ME.

15
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:31,698
I MEAN, I'M PLAYING THIS GAME
FOR REAL.

16
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,366
>> Jeff: AFTER THE SWITCH, HE
WAS FIGHTING

17
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,618
FOR HIS LIFE ON THE LA FLOR
TRIBE.

18
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,412
HIS BIGGEST ENEMY WAS JANE.

19
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,080
>> AT TRIBAL COUNCIL I HOPE
MARTY GOES HOME.

20
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:42,667
>> Jeff: MARTY HAD ONLY ONE ALLY
JILL, AND ONE WEAPON--

21
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:46,129
A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, AND THEN
THERE'S SASH.

22
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:49,299
SASH HAD BECOME THE PUPPET
MASTER AT LA FLOR.

23
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:54,387
>> WHO STAYS IN THIS GAME IT'S
ABOUT HOW LOYAL ARE YOU TO ME.

24
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,140
>> Jeff: ESPADA WINS IMMUNITY!

25
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,976
AFTER LA FLOR LOST THE LAST
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE,

26
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,271
SASH CONVINCED MARTY TO GIVE UP
HIS HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL

27
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,523
IN EXCHANGE FOR MORE LIFE IN THE
GAME.

28
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,942
>> IF WE LOSE THE NEXT IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE,

29
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,152
I'LL GIVE THE IDOL BACK TO YOU.

30
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,821
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL MARTY
WAS AMAZED

31
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,325
SASH KEPT HIS WORD AND SENT JILL
HOME INSTEAD.

32
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,284
JILL, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

33
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:19,204
NOW MARTY IS LEFT COMPLETELY
ALONE

34
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,164
WITH NO FRIENDS AND NO IDOL.

35
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,500
12 ARE LEFT.

36
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,502
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

37
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,308
>> THE VULTURES ARE DEFINITELY
CIRCLING

38
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:43,520
AND IT'S DEAD MAN WALKING.

39
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,022
IT'S DAY 19, AND I CAN'T BELIEVE

40
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:48,358
THIS GAME HAS PUT ME WHERE I'M
AT RIGHT NOW.

41
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,527
LAST NIGHT SUCKED.

42
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,905
JILL WAS AN INCREDIBLE PLAYER, A
GREAT CONTENDER,

43
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:57,033
A LOVER OF THE GAME, AND THERE
ARE SOME PEOPLE LEFT

44
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:59,160
I THINK HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE IN
THIS GAME.

45
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:03,164
SO HAVING NO JILL, NO IDOL, IS
TOTAL EXPOSURE.

46
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,000
I DON'T WANT TO BE THE NEXT
PERSON TO GO FROM "SURVIVOR."

47
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:10,380
I JUST HAVE TO DO THE BEST THAT
I CAN AND HANG ON.

48
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,214
>> GUYS!

49
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,382
>> WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

50
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:17,262
>> UNCLE FABIO FOUND SOME TREE
MAIL!

51
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,429
LET'S READ IT FIRST.

52
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,515
LET'S READ IT.

53
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:21,558
>> I THINK I SEE IT!

54
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,560
>> IT'S LIKE A MAP.

55
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,062
>> WHO WANTS TO HOLD THE KEY?

56
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:27,897
>> OH!

57
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:32,068
>> "LA FLOR PACK UP ALL THE
BELONGINGS YOU WILL NEED

58
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:34,863
FOR THE DURATION OF YOUR STAY
HERE ON THE ISLAND

59
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,407
AND FOLLOW THIS MAP TO YOUR NEW
HOME."

60
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,492
>> MERGE.

61
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,786
>> OH, MY GOD!

62
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,122
>> I THINK I'M GOING TO CRY
RIGHT NOW.

63
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,415
>> COULDN'T HAVE BEEN BETTER
NEWS FOR ME

64
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,542
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.

65
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,712
THE TRIBES GETTING TOGETHER SIX
ON SIX I THINK IS GOING

66
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,922
TO BE MOSTLY A LA FLOR JOCKEYING
AROUND.

67
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,215
THESE GUYS ARE GOING

68
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,592
TO BE WANTED TO OFF ONE OF THEIR
OWN FOR SURE.

69
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,887
THERE WAS DIVISION BEFORE,

70
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,430
NAONKA, AND ALINA,

71
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,764
THEY COULD BE IN TROUBLE.

72
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,434
I'M ECSTATIC, MAN.

73
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,435
I'M BACK IN THE SADDLE AGAIN.

74
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,437
>> ONE, TWO, THREE, LA FLOR!

75
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,427
>> THAT'S A BIG OLD CHEST.

76
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,140
>> ESPADA, DO NOT OPEN THIS BOX
UNTIL YOU HAVE THE KEY.

77
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:45,183
>> THEY HAVE THE KEY.

78
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,559
>> MAKE ROOM AT YOUR CAMP.

79
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:47,477
COMPANY WILL BE ARRIVING SOON.

80
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,271
>> THE MERGE?

81
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,272
>> THE MERGE.

82
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,065
>> HERE?

83
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:53,024
>> YEAH.

84
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,150
>> AT ESPADA?

85
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,151
>> WOW.

86
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:56,152
>> STAYING HERE?

87
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:58,655
GET A FIRE GOING AND WAIT FOR
THEM, I GUESS.

88
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,157
>> WE NEED TO DECIDE WHAT WE'RE
GOING TO DO

89
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,953
SO THAT WE CAN KNOW WHAT'S
HAPPENING.

90
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,996
>> I DON'T KNOW, NOW THAT IT'S
BECOMING MORE

91
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,331
OF AN INDIVIDUAL GAME AND PEOPLE
ARE GOING TO START FENDING

92
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,834
FOR THEMSELVES, I THINK I NEED
TO DO THE SAME.

93
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:15,171
ALINA, YOU CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH
HER.

94
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:16,839
SHE BURNED SOME BRIDGES EARLY ON
THE IN GAME

95
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,676
AND SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO GO HOME
NEXT WHEN WE WERE

96
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,345
THE ORIGINAL LA FLOR, SO SHE'S
DEFINITELY OUTLASTED

97
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,598
HER EXPECTED TIME IN THIS GAME
AND I THINK EVERYBODY AGREES

98
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,351
IT'S TIME FOR HER TO GO HOME.

99
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:32,313
>> LIKE, WE CAN GET TO FINAL SIX

100
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,607
IF THE SIX OF US STAY STRONG.

101
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,652
IF NOBODY PUSHES US ASIDE

102
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,530
THE SIX OF US CAN TOTALLY DO IT.

103
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,365
MARTY IS STILL HERE.

104
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,201
MARTY WILL BE OUR BIGGEST THREAT
IN THE GAME

105
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:45,743
AND THAT MEANS HE HAS TO GO
FIRST.

106
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,662
>> AND HE HAS AN IDOL.

107
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:48,871
>> AND HE HAS AN IDOL SO THAT
MEANS WE HAVE

108
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,540
TO DO A MAJOR BLIND-SIDE.

109
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,417
AS LONG AS HE DOESN'T GET
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY--

110
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,795
LET'S MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T
HAPPEN, GUYS--

111
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:59,716
AND THEN WE GET RID OF THE HEAD
HONCHO.

112
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:04,012
>> NOBODY WAS REALLY ON BOARD
WITH ALINA'S PLAN AT ALL,

113
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,014
NOT EVEN UNCLE DAN.

114
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:09,726
ALINA IS IN THIS PLAN BY HERSELF
THE ONE-WOMAN ARMY,

115
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,936
WITHOUT KNOWING SHE'S GOING TO
BE THE FIRST ONE OUT

116
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,438
IF SHE DOESN'T GET THE IMMUNITY
FIRST.

117
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,689
SHE CAN BE G.I.
JANE ALL SHE WANTS BUT SHE WILL

118
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:21,029
BE G.I. JANE ALL BY HERSELF WITH
NO ARMY, NOBODY BEHIND HER.

119
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,363
>> HERE THEY ARE, GUYS.

120
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,615
>> WHO'S GONE?

121
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,534
>> IT LOOKS LIKE JILL'S GONE?

122
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:27,410
>> WHO'S GONE?

123
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,494
>> JILL.

124
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,580
JILL'S GONE.

125
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,707
>> WE THOUGHT THAT MARTY AND
JILL WERE

126
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,375
SUPER STRONG OVER THERE.

127
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,710
WE THOUGHT THEY WERE, LIKE,
RUNNING THINGS

128
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:36,627
AND IT TELLS US A LOT THAT JILL
WAS VOTED OUT.

129
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,547
>> THIS IS THE COMPANY WE WERE
EXPECTING.

130
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,885
>> WELCOME BACK.

131
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,637
>> COMING BACK TO CAMP WAS LIKE
REBIRTH.

132
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,431
IT REALLY FELT LIKE HOME, SWEET
HOME.

133
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:52,310
AND I FELT LIKE THE GAME IS
STARTING ALL OVER AGAIN,

134
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,103
AND I'VE BEEN GIVEN A NEW LEASE
ON LIFE.

135
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,439
>> SHOULD WE GO SEE WHAT'S IN
THE CHEST?

136
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,608
>> LET'S GO OPEN THE CHEST!

137
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,651
>> ALL RIGHT.

138
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,448
>> OPEN IT UP.

139
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,116
(\CHEERS\)

140
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,493
>> OH, MY GOD!

141
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,619
>> BREAD, BREAD, BREAD!

142
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:14,832
>> LA FLOR AND ESPADA, REPLACE
YOUR OLD BUFFS

143
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:15,625
WITH THESE NEW ONES.

144
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,668
YOU HAVE MERGED.

145
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,253
COME UP WITH A NEW TRIBE NAME

146
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,756
AND BEGIN THE NEXT PHASE OF YOUR
ADVENTURE.

147
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,633
GOOD LUCK, ENJOY THE GIFTS.

148
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,967
YOU HAVE EARNED THEM.

149
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,511
(\CHEERS\)

150
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,471
>> WE MADE IT TO THE MERGE!

151
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,973
AND WE'RE GOING TO FEAST!

152
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,017
YOU KNOW, WE'RE MERGING!

153
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,143
OH!

154
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,520
I'M DIGGING THE RED BUFFS.

155
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,647
>> I THOUGHT OF A NAME FOR THE
NEW TRIBE, "LIBERTAD."

156
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:42,735
WHICH IS FREEDOM, LIBERTY.

157
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,654
I KIND OF DIG THAT I GOT TO
OFFER THE NEW NAME.

158
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:48,282
"LIBERTAD" REALLY RESONATED FOR
ME PERSONALLY.

159
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,661
IT MEANS LIBERTY, AND IN THIS
CASE, IT CAN ALSO MEAN FREEDOM,

160
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:55,331
FREEDOM FROM EVERYTHING THAT'S
HAPPENED UP TO THIS POINT,

161
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,333
AND IT'S A NEW START.

162
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,380
>> LET'S GET BACK TO CAMP.

163
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,677
>> YES, OH, MAN.

164
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,678
WE HAVE TO DRINK ALL OF THIS
TODAY!

165
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,680
>> EVERYBODY GRAB A COOKIE.

166
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,186
>> LIBERTAD!

167
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,021
>> WHEN WE FINALLY OPENED THE
TREASURE CHEST,

168
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,690
THAT FOOD WAS YUMMY TO MY TUMMY.

169
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,276
THE SALAMI, I THINK IT JUST
DISSOLVED IN MY MOUTH.

170
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:23,693
IT WAS SO GOOD.

171
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,569
LIKE MY BOOTY?

172
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,653
(\FARTS\)

173
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,697
I EVEN SNUCK SOME NUTS TO PUT IN
MY BRA.

174
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,659
I WAS GETTING IT ALL, HONEY, ALL
OF IT.

175
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:35,538
I PROBABLY STILL HAVE SOME
PEANUTS IN MY-- IN MY POCKET.

176
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,206
>> WOW!

177
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,374
>> WOW!

178
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:39,167
>> YEAH, NOW YOU'LL GIVE ME A
HUG.

179
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,711
NOW THAT WE'RE ALL FAT AND
HAPPY.

180
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,213
>> SEEING NAONKA AGAIN WAS THE
BEST

181
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,717
BECAUSE I FELT LIKE, WOW, SHE'S
REAL, SUCH A RELIEF.

182
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,722
I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T HAVE TO
SECOND GUESS HER AT ALL.

183
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,557
>> SHE ALREADY IS.

184
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,059
WE NEED TO TAKE A WALK.

185
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,519
>> YEAH.

186
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,020
>> TO KNOW THAT WE'RE BACK IN
THE GAME TOGETHER

187
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:03,566
FEELS REALLY GOOD.

188
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,861
KEEP IN MIND, ONLY THE PERSON
THAT DON'T HAVE NO ALLIANCE,

189
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,530
SO BE CAREFUL OF HER.

190
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,740
SHE'S GOING TO BE WATCHING YOU.

191
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:14,076
>> ME AND NAONKA TALKED ABOUT
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED.

192
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,578
SHE TALKED ABOUT HOW ALINA HAS
BEEN SO SHADY.

193
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,747
I DON'T KNOW, I TOLD HER
EVERYTHING

194
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,957
THAT HAPPENED ON THE OTHER SIDE.

195
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,418
THEY TREATED JANE REALLY BAD AND
I STOOD UP FOR HER.

196
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:24,128
I DON'T KNOW, EVERYBODY OVER
HERE THOUGHT

197
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,338
SHE WAS HOOKING UP WITH MARTY.

198
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,547
>> REALLY?

199
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,965
>> INCLUDING ME.
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE.

200
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:28,758
MAYBE MARTY IS SMART AND HE'S
STRONG

201
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,968
BUT IT SEEMED LIKE HE WAS
GUNNING.

202
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,470
>> I TOLD HER EVERYTHING.

203
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,097
SHE KNOWS WITH ME IT'S 100%.

204
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:39,060
SO SASH CAME UP WITH A BRILLIANT
IDEA TO ASK HIM FOR THE IDOL,

205
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:39,769
TO GIVE IT TO SASH.

206
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,104
>> DOES SASH HAVE IT?

207
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:42,939
>> SASH HAS THE IDOL.

208
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,273
>> OH!

209
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:44,690
GET OUT OF HERE!

210
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,609
>> HE DID IT.

211
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,444
>> BRENDA, THE ONE THAT WAS WITH
ME AND I FOUND

212
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:52,156
THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, SASH
ASKED MARTY FOR

213
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,116
AND IT HE GAVE IT TO HIM.

214
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,825
THE SOONER WE GET
ALINA AND MARTY OUT

215
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,328
THE SMOOTHER THE GAME WILL GO.

216
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,663
>> WE'LL BE ABLE TO KNOCK THEM
OUT ONE BY ONE BY ONE BY ONE.

217
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,540
>> THIS IS GOING TO GET REAL
WEIRD.

218
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,792
>> THIS IS GOING TO GET WICKED.

219
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,670
>> I'M DEAD SERIOUS.

220
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,100
>> I LOVE THE STATE OF GEORGIA,
REALLY.

221
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,893
>> WE'VE GOT A CREEK BELOW OUR
HOUSE.

222
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,813
68 STEPS TO GO DOWN THERE.

223
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:27,149
I WAS RUNNING THAT 10 TIMES A
DAY GETTING IN SHAPE FOR THIS,

224
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,360
RUNNING THREE MILES A DAY AND
SWIMMING, TOO.

225
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,200
>> YOU SEEM LIKE A REAL COOL
LADY.

226
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,702
>> HONEY, YOU CAN STAY AT MY
HOUSE ANY TIME.

227
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:41,122
EVEN IF I'M NOT THERE, THE DOOR
IS ALREADY OPEN.

228
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:45,751
GOT TURKEYS, GOT A DOG THAT
LIVES IN THE YARD.

229
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:51,173
I FEEL VERY SAFE PLUS I HAVE A
SHOTGUN, A .22.

230
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:51,882
>> JANE AND I CLICKED RIGHT
AWAY.

231
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,885
SHE'S A GOOD, OLD LADY.

232
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,012
SHE'S AN AWESOME LADY.

233
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,346
SHE TALKS WITH A TWANG.

234
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,514
SHE REMINDS ME AT HOME.

235
00:09:58,597 --> 00:09:59,348
I MISS MY HOME.

236
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,641
I MISS MY MOTHER.

237
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,728
HER AND I CAN CONNECT VERY WELL.

238
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,897
>> THEY TREATED ME LIKE I WAS
THE UGLY DUCKLING OVER HERE

239
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:10,860
BECAUSE I HAD A SOUTHERN ACCENT
AND I'M A RED NECK.

240
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,320
>> I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE SO
BAD.

241
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,156
I LOVE A NORTH CAROLINA GIRL.

242
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,575
PEOPLE NEED TO STICK TOGETHER.

243
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,993
>> AND I KNEW RIGHT THEN AND
THERE,

244
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,037
YOU'RE A NORTH CAROLINA BOY, I'M
A NORTH CAROLINA GIRL,

245
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,331
WE'RE GOING TO HIT IT OFF REALLY
GOOD.

246
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,916
AND I WAS TALKING TO CHASE ABOUT
HIS DAD PASSING

247
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,878
AND MY HUSBAND PASSING, SO I'VE
GOT A CONNECTION WITH HIM,

248
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,921
WITH CHASE.

249
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,885
>> WHAT ARE WE DOING?

250
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,887
BREAKFAST, HUH?

251
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,603
>> DON'T TAKE A BIG ASS BITE,
EITHER.

252
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,729
>> HEY, IS THIS COOL?

253
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,065
NAONKA?

254
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,068
>> I GUESS, I DON'T KNOW.

255
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:56,030
IT'S DAY 20, WE DON'T HAVE A LOT
OF FOOD LEFT AND I WOKE UP

256
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,406
THIS MORNING VERY IRRITABLE.

257
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,744
IT WAS MY IDEA TO MAKE THE
TORTILLAS AND THE FACT

258
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,912
THAT I'M THE LAST TO GET
EVERYTHING

259
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,748
AND I GET THE SMALLEST TORTILLA.

260
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:06,749
OKAY, YOU GUYS WANT TO PLAY.

261
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,416
I CAN PLAY, TOO.

262
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,880
>> DON'T TAKE A BIG BITE, FABIO.

263
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:17,927
>> I JUST WANTED IT TEST IT OUT
YOU KNOW.

264
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,970
>> THIS MORNING, AFTER WE WERE
DONE EATING BREAKFAST,

265
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:24,266
NA TOOK THE FLOUR AND PUT IT IN
HER BAG,

266
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,104
AND SHE GOT UP AND SHE WALKED
OUT OF CAMP.

267
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,439
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS A LITTLE
STRANGE.

268
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:34,944
WHY DID SHE JUST TAKE THE FLOUR?

269
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,154
>> I'M HIDING THE FLOUR BECAUSE
THOSE TORTILLAS WERE GOOD

270
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,824
AND EVERYBODY WAS BEING STINGY
AND I PUT A LOT OF MY HEART

271
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,952
AND SOUL INTO MAKING THOSE
THINGS AND I MADE A BIG ONE

272
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,537
FOR ME AND THEY ALL TOOK IT.

273
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,330
THEY REALLY MADE ME MAD.

274
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,915
SO I'M GOING TO MAKE THEM MAD.

275
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:48,958
DON'T PLAY WITH ME IN THIS GAME.

276
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,960
I CAN PLAY DIRTY.

277
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:08,310
I AM STEALING EQUIPMENT TO MAKE
TORTILLAS, AND I'M TAKING FRUIT.

278
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,814
I'VE TAKEN BOWLS AND SPOONS.

279
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:15,359
IT TASTES BETTER WHEN YOU'RE
STEALING IT.

280
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,779
IT'S LIKE A SWEET VICTORY.

281
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,031
ALINA, EVERYBODY IS AGAINST HER
RIGHT NOW.

282
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:24,618
I DON'T MIND BEING THAT ONE
PERSON THAT, YOU KNOW,

283
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,620
TELLS HER A LITTLE
SOMETHING-SOMETHING.

284
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,172
>> SO WHERE DO YOU STAND?

285
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,673
DO YOU STAND WITH THE SIX WE
TALKED ABOUT

286
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,008
OR ARE YOU BACK WITH BRENDA?

287
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,635
>> I'M WITH THE SIX.

288
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,345
>> IF ANYBODY I WAS WORRIED
ABOUT IS YOU.

289
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,847
>> WHY?

290
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,015
>> BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
BACK WITH BRENDA.

291
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,684
I MEAN, YOU SPENT ALL DAY WITH
HER YESTERDAY.

292
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,687
>> I WAS CATCHING UP WITH HER.

293
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,189
>> DO YOU THINK THE FIRST VOTE
WILL STILL BE MARTY?

294
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,524
>> KELLY IS RIGHT THERE.

295
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,068
I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE
GUNNING FOR YOU.

296
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:02,156
>> WHY DO PEOPLE WANT TO GET RID
OF ME?

297
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:07,036
>> THEY'RE GUNNING FOR YOU, MAN,
I DON'T KNOW.

298
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,954
>> DO THEY HAVE THE NUMBERS TO
DO THAT?

299
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,373
>> THEY DON'T HAVE ME.

300
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,876
I DON'T KNOW WHO ELSE THEY GOT,
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT.

301
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:18,130
>> EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT
CLAIMED THEY WERE GOING

302
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:22,218
TO BE STRONG SIX TOTALLY LIED.

303
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:26,013
AND THERE I AM THE FOOL THAT WAS
SITTING THERE LIKE I REALLY AM

304
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,349
GOING TO DO THIS TO THESE
PEOPLE.

305
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,489
>> BUT YOU HAVE TO BUST YOUR
ASS.

306
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:47,660
>> I WAS THINKING OF ANOTHER
PLAN, OTHER THAN JUST WINNING.

307
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,166
I'VE GOT TO GET SOME NUMBERS.

308
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,125
>> WHO?
EVERYBODY IS AGAINST YOU.

309
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,419
>> WHY IS EVERYBODY AGAINST ME?

310
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,754
>> I DON'T KNOW.

311
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:02,341
>> I BUSTED MY ASS SINCE DAY ONE
OUT HERE.

312
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,717
>> EVERYTHING EVERYBODY IS
LOOKING AT YOU RIGHT NOW

313
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,969
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE AN ALLIANCE.

314
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,971
I THINK THEY THINK THAT YOU'RE A
THREAT

315
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,098
BUT YOU'RE EASY TO GET OUT.

316
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,767
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GRABBED
ALL THIS STUFF.

317
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,769
YOU'RE CRAZY.

318
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,062
>> I'M HAVING FUN.
YOU GOTTA HAVE FUN.

319
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:19,108
>> IT'S SO GOOD.

320
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,111
>> MY REASON FOR TELLING ALINA
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE

321
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,780
THE FIRST ONE OUT, THAT'S A VOTE
THAT I'LL HAVE GUARANTEED

322
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:26,198
WHEN SHE'S A PART OF THE JURY.

323
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,450
SO I HAVE TO BE SMART.

324
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,910
IF I WANT TO KEEP TALKING TO
ALINA,

325
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,287
BECAUSE I WANT HER TO FEEL SAFE
WITH ME.

326
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,955
I WANT HER TO KNOW I HAVE HER
BACK EVEN THOUGH

327
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,457
I KIND OF DON'T BUT I KIND OF DO
AT THE SAME TIME.

328
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,960
IT'S LIKE A TOSS-UP.

329
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,462
>> DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE BIG
WOODEN BOWL WENT?

330
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,131
>> LAST TIME I SAW IT, IT WAS
RIGHT OVER THERE

331
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,759
AND IT'S NOT THERE ANYMORE.

332
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,803
>> WHAT ABOUT THE FRYING PAN?

333
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:49,638
IS THAT GONE, TOO?

334
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,306
FOR SURE, FOR SURE?

335
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,809
THE BOWL AND THE FRYING PAN?

336
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:55,144
>> YUP.

337
00:14:55,227 --> 00:15:01,150
>> THAT DIDN'T JUST GET SWEPT
AWAY BY THE TIDE, YOU GUYS.

338
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,526
>> HEY, WHERE'S THE FLOUR?

339
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,737
>> NO WAY!

340
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,988
THEY TOOK THE FLOUR!

341
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,990
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

342
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,992
>> THAT'S REALLY UNCOOL.

343
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,999
>> NAONKA, DID YOU PUT THE FLOUR

344
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:21,670
BACK IN THE CHEST?

345
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,672
I SAW HER TAKE IT AND PUT IT IN
HER BAG.

346
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,508
>> AND I PUT IT BACK, AND I SAID
I PUT IT BACK.

347
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,760
>> YOU PUT IT IN YOUR BAG?

348
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:28,469
>> AND I PUT IT BACK.

349
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,846
I DIDN'T EVEN PUT IT IN MY BAG.

350
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:32,473
>> WHY DID IT GO IN THE BAG?

351
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,766
>> I WAS GOING TO PUT HALF IN
THERE.

352
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,184
>> YOU UNDERSTAND WHY EVERYBODY
IS WONDERING

353
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,353
WHY YOU PUT IT IN YOUR BACK?

354
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,647
>> I DIDN'T TAKE IT, UNCLE DAN,
I DIDN'T TAKE IT.

355
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,689
FABIO, I DIDN'T TAKE IT.

356
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,024
SASH I DIDN'T TAKE IT.

357
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,984
I'M DONE, FABIO.

358
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,527
I ALREADY SAID WHAT I'M GOING TO
SAID.

359
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,655
>> I DON'T KNOW WHY IT HAD TO GO
IN YOUR BAG.

360
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,699
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

361
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,242
>> JUST SO YOU KNOW, NOBODY ON
THE TRIBE UNDERSTANDS

362
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,662
WHY IT HAD TO GO IN YOUR BAG.

363
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,163
>> I PUT IT BACK.

364
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,750
>> WE'RE NOT ASKING YOU IF YOU
PUT IT BACK OR NOT!

365
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,669
WE'RE NOT--

366
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,128
WE'RE NOT ASKING YOU
WHETHER YOU PUT IT...

367
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:11,762
>> IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!

368
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:12,930
>> OH, MY GOD.

369
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,181
IT WAS SO HARD TO SIT THERE.

370
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,725
IT'S NOT LIKE I WAS FREE OF
GUILT.

371
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:21,063
OBVIOUSLY, I'M TOTALLY CONNECTED
WITH THE FACT THAT SHE DID THAT.

372
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,898
BECAUSE I KNEW ABOUT IT, AND I
DIDN'T STOP HER

373
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:23,899
AND I DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY ABOUT
IT.

374
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:27,069
THE REASON IT WAS SO HARD FOR ME
TO OWN UP TO IT,

375
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,321
EVERYBODY MIGHT BE EQUALLY AS
PISSED OFF AS ME

376
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,448
AS THEY ARE AT NAONKA.

377
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,409
>> ARE YOU PUTTING MY NAME OUT
THERE?

378
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,744
>> NO.
IT NEEDS TO COME OUT.

379
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,912
EVERYTHING NEEDS TO COME OUT.

380
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:38,455
WHAT HAPPENED?

381
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:42,209
WHAT THIS TRIBE NEEDS RIGHT NOW,
IS THIS COMES OUT.

382
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,795
>> FOR EVERYTHING TO JUST COME
BACK HERE.

383
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,588
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY EVERYBODY
HAS TO PUT NAMES.

384
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,549
WHAT DO YOU WANT A NAME?

385
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:53,053
>> THAT'S THE THING, A LOT OF
PEOPLE NOW KNOW IT WAS YOU.

386
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:53,679
YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAY IT.

387
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,431
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

388
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,266
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS
JUST 'FESS UP.

389
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,269
EVERYBODY WILL APPRECIATE IT AND
RESPECT YOU SO MUCH MORE.

390
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,772
>> I TOLD EVERYBODY INDIVIDUALLY
I DID NOT TAKE IT.

391
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,356
>> YOU LIED.

392
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,109
YOU LIED IN "SURVIVOR?"

393
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,485
>> EVERYONE WILL GET THAT.

394
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,112
>> EVERYONE'S LIED IN
"SURVIVOR."

395
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:13,907
>> I LIED FOR YOU GUYS.

396
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,159
I'M JUST TRYING TO PLAY THE GAME
BUT I DID NOT DO IT

397
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,327
WITH THE INTENTION TO STARVE
EVERYONE.

398
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,663
ALINA AND I TOOK A WALK.

399
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,166
>> ALINA WITH YOU WHEN YOU TOOK
THE BOWL OUT THERE?

400
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:26,462
>> I DID GRAB THE FLOUR AND MY
PURPOSE WAS TO MEASURE IT OUT

401
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,423
FOR HALF AND HALF BECAUSE WE
WERE USING A WHOLE LOT OF FOOD.

402
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:32,801
>> WERE YOU DOING THAT TO HALF
THE FLOUR--

403
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,304
LET'S BE STRAIGHT ALL THE WAY
THROUGH-- OR WERE YOU GOING

404
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,306
TO SAVE SOME OF THAT FLOUR LATER
TO USE IT

405
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:41,018
FOR YOUR ADVANTAGE AND SHARE IT.

406
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,103
>> NO, I WAS TRYING TO PORTION
IT OUT.

407
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,397
>> SHE'S SAYING SHE WAS DOING IT
FOR THE BETTER OF THE TRIBE.

408
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,273
SORRY, I'M NOT BUYING IT.

409
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,941
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY IT.

410
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,277
>> I COULD HAVE SAID, "GUYS,
WE'RE USING WAY TOO MUCH FLOUR.

411
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,154
LET'S CHILL."

412
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,323
>> THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS I
COULD HAVE GONE ABOUT IT

413
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:58,285
BUT I WENT ANOTHER WAY.

414
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,328
YOU GUYS DON'T NEED TO POINT THE
FINGER AT HER.

415
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,830
IT'S NOT LIKE IT WAS HER IDEA.

416
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,123
IT WASN'T.

417
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:03,832
>> THANK YOU.

418
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,169
THANK YOU, THAT'S A NICE
THING...

419
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:07,836
>> I APOLOGIZE.

420
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,837
>> WE'LL TRY TO MAKE IT EASY.

421
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,174
>> STEALING FOOD OF ALL THINGS,
IN "SURVIVOR,"

422
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,844
YOU WOULD THINK THAT HAVING DONE
WHAT SHE DID,

423
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,347
WOULD MEAN YOU'RE DONE, LIKE,
INSTANTLY GONE.

424
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,140
BUT ANYBODY THAT'S ON THE
CHOPPING BLOCK

425
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,558
CAN BE VALUABLE TO SOMEBODY
ELSE.

426
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,060
SHE LIED AND SHE STOLE.

427
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,686
HOW EASY IS THAT?
GET RID OF HER.

428
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,648
IT SHOULD BE THAT SIMPLE BUT
THIS GAME IS NEVER SIMPLE.

429
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,412
>> MARTY.

430
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,456
>> WHAT'S FOR BREAKFAST.

431
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,049
>> IT WAS CRAZY NAONKA WOULD
THINK OF SOMETHING AS RIDICULOUS

432
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:56,385
AS STEALING THE FRYING PAN,
BOWL, AND ALL THE STUFF

433
00:18:56,468 --> 00:19:01,515
TO MIX TORTILLAS, BUT ALINA
CONFESSED TO BEING A PART OF IT.

434
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:04,393
SHE'S HAD A TARGET FOR THE
LONGEST TIME,

435
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,229
AND ON TOP OF ALL OF THAT, SHE
HAS THIS?

436
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,983
IT SUCKS TO BE ALINA RIGHT NOW.

437
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,711
>> NAONKA DEFINITELY IS NOT ONE
OF THE FAVORITE PEOPLE IN CAMP

438
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,547
AT THE MOMENT BUT THAT WORKS
PERFECTLY INTO MY GAME PLAN AS

439
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:37,885
HAVING HER AS ONE OF THE FINAL
THREE BECAUSE THAT PRETTY MUCH

440
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,095
GUARANTEES HER THAT SHE'S NOT
GOING TO RECEIVE

441
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:44,391
ANY MILLION-DOLLAR VOTES.

442
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:48,437
>> I REASSURED ALL THE GUYS THAT
ALINA NEEDS

443
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,065
TO GO HOME FIRST TONIGHT, AND
JUST KEEP ON DOING

444
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:52,733
WHAT YOU'RE DOING, AND KIND OF
PRETEND

445
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:56,278
LIKE YOU'RE SORRY, YOU KNOW.

446
00:19:56,361 --> 00:20:01,950
AND EVERY DAY IT WILL JUST KIND
OF BE A THING OF THE PAST.

447
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,453
AND IF HER-- YOUR NAME GOES ON
THE CHOPPING BLOCK,

448
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,539
WE'LL PICK ONE OF THEM.

449
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,125
YOU'RE MY NUMBER ONE GIRL HERE.

450
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:14,588
>> DITTO.

451
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,758
>> BRENDA!

452
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,092
>> UH-OH!

453
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,636
>> SHE CAUGHT ANOTHER FISH.

454
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,304
>> FISH DANCE.

455
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:26,266
>> YO, BABY.
YO, BABY.

456
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,101
>> IS THIS THE FOURTH FISH?

457
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,103
>> FIFTH.

458
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,027
SOMEBODY COME HELP ME GET SOME
FRESH WATER.

459
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:41,156
>> YEAH, I'LL GET RIGHT ON IT.

460
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,616
THE MORE JANE STAYS IN THE GAME,

461
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,451
THE MORE COMPLICATED THE GAME
GETS.

462
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:48,330
I THINK THEY ALL SEE THE
CONNECTION SHE MADE WITH CHASE.

463
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,959
I BET YOU THAT CAN'T BE UNWOUND,
THE WHOLE CAROLINA THING

464
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:56,046
AND "MY MOMMA TOLD ME" AND ALL
THAT CRAP HAS NOW INFECTED CHASE

465
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:59,466
AND IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO
SPREAD LIKE CANCEROUS TENTACLES

466
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,468
THROUGH THE TRIBE.

467
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,848
YOU LET SOMEBODY LIKE JANE GET
UNDER THE RADAR,

468
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,558
THE FURTHER IT GOES THE MORE
DANGEROUS IT IS.

469
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:13,855
I MEAN, HER STORY IS THE SADDEST
STORY EVER ON EARTH,

470
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,525
AND HER CATCHING FISH-- EVERY
TIME SHE CASHES FISH,

471
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,694
THE WHOLE JANE DANCE AND
EVERYTHING, ALL THAT STUFF,

472
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,904
ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU'RE GOING TO
BE SITTING THERE LIKE HOLY COW.

473
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,657
I THINK IT'S A DONE DEAL.

474
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,616
ANYBODY THAT GOES TO FINAL WITH
HER, YOU'RE COOKED.

475
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,995
>> MARTY HAS THE WRONG
PERCEPTION OF JANE,

476
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:32,457
BUT MARTY IS SOMEBODY TO WATCH
BECAUSE HE IS TALKING

477
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:36,336
TO BENRY AND FABIO AND, DAN AND
IF HE WANTS

478
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,047
SOMEBODY OUT SO BADLY,

479
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,509
MAYBE HE ALREADY HAS A REALLY
GOOD STRATEGY TO GET TO THE END.

480
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,386
SO MAYBE IT IS JUST GOOD TO GET
RID OF IT

481
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,430
BEFORE WE ALL START GETTING
WARPED.

482
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,605
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

483
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:03,905
SHALL WE GET
TO TODAY'S CHALLENGE?

484
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,115
>> All: YES. YEAH.

485
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:08,410
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
DAN, I'LL TAKE BACK IMMUNITY.

486
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,203
>> NO MORE BABY CORTEZ.

487
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,456
>> Jeff: TRIBAL IMMUNITY
IS NO MORE.

488
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,377
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
IS WHAT YOU SEEK.

489
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,421
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE,

490
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:23,258
YOU WILL EACH HAVE TWO METAL
HANDLES THAT YOU WILL USE

491
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:25,927
TO KEEP TENSION ON A STEEL BAR.

492
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,638
IF YOU RELEASE THE TENSION EVEN
FOR A MOMENT,

493
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:32,434
THE STEEL BAR WILL DROP,
YOUR TILE WILL BREAK,

494
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,061
YOU'RE OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

495
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:39,983
THE LAST MAN AND THE LAST WOMAN
STANDING WIN IMMUNITY.

496
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,611
TWO PEOPLE WILL BE SAFE FROM
THE VOTE AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

497
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,779
MAKE SENSE?

498
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,197
>> All: YUP. YEAH.

499
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,532
>> Jeff: DRAW FOR SPOTS,
WE'LL GET STARTED.

500
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,167
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

501
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,460
FOR IMMUNITY.

502
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,630
EVERYBODY GRAB YOUR HANDLES,
GET SOME TENSION ON THAT BAR.

503
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,674
IN THREE, TWO, ONE, LIFT.

504
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,304
ALL RIGHT, LET'S RELEASE
THEIR TILES.

505
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:14,267
THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.

506
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,981
AND PURPLE KELLY IS FIRST OUT.

507
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,484
FOLLOWED RIGHT BY DAN.

508
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:27,364
JUST LIKE THAT, THREE SECONDS
IN, WE LOSE OUR FIRST TWO.

509
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,037
ALINA IS OUT.

510
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,040
AND NOT HAPPY.

511
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:40,085
REMEMBER, YOU'VE GOT TO GET
TENSION ON THAT BAR.

512
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,674
TOTAL CONCENTRATION.

513
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,723
BRENDA IS OUT.

514
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:58,895
BENRY'S OUT.

515
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:02,149
THIS IS ABOUT WANTING IT.

516
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,025
KEEP DIGGING.

517
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:09,030
SASH IS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

518
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,991
NAONKA IS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

519
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:15,912
VERY QUICKLY WE ARE DOWN TO JANE
VERSUS HOLLY FOR THE WOMEN,

520
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:20,917
MARTY, FABIO, CHASE FOR THE MEN.

521
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,217
HOLLY STRUGGLING.

522
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,386
HOLLY OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

523
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:32,596
JANE IS THE LAST WOMAN STANDING.

524
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,890
JANE WINS IMMUNITY
FOR THE WOMEN.

525
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:35,932
(APPLAUSE)

526
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,017
>> GOOD JOB, JANE!

527
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,059
>> Jeff: YOU CAN DROP.

528
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,102
>> YOU SURE?

529
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,228
>> Jeff: I'M SURE.

530
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,688
>> WHAT IF I WANT TO BEAT THEM?

531
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,231
>> Jeff: GO FOR IT.

532
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,775
JANE HAS ALREADY WON IMMUNITY,
DOES NOT WANT TO GIVE UP YET,

533
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:49,237
TRYING TO PROVE A POINT
IN THIS GAME,

534
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,197
GONNA STAY IN THIS CHALLENGE

535
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,781
EVEN THOUGH SHE ALREADY HAS
A NECKLACE.

536
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,576
>> SHE'S A NORTH CAROLINA GIRL,
JEFF.

537
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,244
>> YOU GOT IT, JANE.

538
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,747
>> PICKING UP 80-POUND DOGS
HELPS.

539
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,890
>> Jeff: MARTY IS OUT
OF THE CHALLENGE.

540
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:20,227
WE ARE NOW DOWN
TO FABIO AND CHASE.

541
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:33,073
OLDEST WOMAN OUT HERE,
ONE OF THE LAST THREE STANDING

542
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,659
AGAINST TWO OF THE YOUNG,
STRONG GUYS.

543
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:44,251
CHASE DROPS HIS BAR, FABIO WINS
IMMUNITY FOR THE MEN.

544
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,503
JANE WINS IMMUNITY
FOR THE WOMEN.

545
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:47,796
>> NICE JOB, FABIO.

546
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:50,131
(APPLAUSE)

547
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,425
>> I'M NOT BREAKING MY TILE!

548
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,760
>> Jeff: JANE, COME ON OVER.

549
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:54,844
FABIO, COME ON OVER.

550
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,347
>> GOOD JOB, JANE.

551
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,014
>> GOOD JOB, YOU GUYS.

552
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,141
>> Jeff: JANE WINS IMMUNITY.

553
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,811
JANE IS SAFE
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

554
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,984
FABIO ALSO HAS IMMUNITY.
FABIO ALSO SAFE.

555
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,820
JANE AND FABIO SAFE TONIGHT
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

556
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,113
EVERYBODY ELSE FAIR GAME.

557
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,365
SHOULD BE AN INTERESTING
AFTERNOON.

558
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:18,368
OUR FIRST MERGED TRIBAL COUNCIL.

559
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:20,870
GRAB YOUR STUFF.
HEAD BACK TO CAMP. CONGRATS.

560
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:37,012
>> GOOD JOB, GUYS.

561
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:37,929
>> NICE JOB, GUYS.

562
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,764
>> NICE JOB, YOU GUYS.

563
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,561
>> LET ME SEE MY GIRLS
OVER HERE.

564
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:44,978
>> CONGRATULATIONS!

565
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,022
>> GOOD JOB!

566
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:49,858
>> HEY, CAN I GET IN?

567
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:50,942
>> GET IN HERE!

568
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,361
>> ANOTHER ONE.

569
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,869
>> MY WHOLE GOAL TODAY
WAS TO BEAT MARTY.

570
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,705
>> JANE, VERY IMPRESSIVE, JANE.

571
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:04,664
VERY IMPRESSIVE, JANE.

572
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,041
(APPLAUSE)

573
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:09,002
>> I'M JUST TRYING JUST TO PROVE
TO MARTY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

574
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,046
I MAY BE LITTLE, I MAY BE SMALL,

575
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:14,007
BUT THERE AIN'T NO WAY IN HELL
ON A INDIVIDUAL CHALLENGE

576
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:14,841
THAT YOU WILL BEAT ME.

577
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:19,095
SO... (GRUNTS, LAUGHS)

578
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,226
>> SO WE NEED TO GET, LIKE,

579
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:29,439
US GIRLS TOGETHER AND SASH,
AND GET MARTY OUT.

580
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:30,732
AND THAT'S IT.

581
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,192
>> YEAH.

582
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,736
>> IF YOU GUYS TELL ME YOU'RE
VOTING FOR ME NOW,

583
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:35,779
THEY'LL NEVER SEE IT COMING,
AND YOU CAN BLAME MARTY.

584
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:36,863
>> I DON'T.

585
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,240
>> I NEEDED TO WIN TODAY.

586
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,910
UM, I KNOW THAT I'M IN
THE HOT SEAT,

587
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,787
BUT I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
THAT IS.

588
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,873
I KNOW THAT JANE HATES MARTY AND
SHE WANTS TO SEE HIM GONE,

589
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,250
AND JANE HAS A LOT OF NUMBERS ON
HER SIDE,

590
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,252
AND I HAPPEN TO BE
ON HER SIDE, TOO.

591
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,253
SO I'M TRYING TO LAY LOW,

592
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,757
AND HOPE THAT MAYBE THE DRAMA
THAT'S GOING ON

593
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,925
IS NOT GONNA REVOLVE AROUND ME.

594
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,928
>> I'M DOWN TO VOTE WHOEVER:
MARTY OR ALINA OUT.

595
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,972
I'M GONNA VOTER EITHER ONE,
WHICHEVER ONE EVERYONE DECIDES.

596
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:06,101
IT'S JUST, WE HAVE
TO GET HER OUT SECOND.

597
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,061
>> YEAH, WE WILL.
I THINK SHE'S A BIGGER THREAT.

598
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,938
>> I THINK IN CHALLENGES,

599
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,608
I THINK HE DEMORALIZES
OUR ENTIRE CAMP.

600
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:15,568
>> HE DOES DEMORALIZE
OUR ENTIRE CAMP.

601
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,948
>> ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.

602
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,783
>> PURPLE KELLY.

603
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:22,951
>> PURPLE KELLY IS FIVE.

604
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,957
>> THAT'S SEVEN RIGHT THERE.

605
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,125
>> THAT'S SEVEN.

606
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,502
>> YOU GUYS NEED TO, WELL, WE
NEED TO TRY TO TALK

607
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:35,463
TO ALL OF THEM, BECAUSE AS FAR
AS SASH GOES, IT'S ALINA.

608
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,340
>> MAKE SURE.

609
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:40,301
>> WELL, EVERYBODY WAS DEBATING
ABOUT MARTY AND ALINA,

610
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,430
BUT JANE REALLY, REALLY WANTS
MARTY OUT, LIKE, EVEN IF WE WERE

611
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,347
TO JUST ALL WRITE DOWN ALINA,

612
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,891
SHE WILL BE THE ONE
TO WRITE DOWN MARTY.

613
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,980
>> SEE, IT'S BETWEEN MARTY
OR ALINA.

614
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:55,442
I'LL JUST GO
WITH THE MAJORITY, MAN.

615
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:01,489
>> I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

616
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,492
>> UM, I HAVE TO ASK YOU GUYS
A BIG FAVOR.

617
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:08,037
YOU KNOW, BACK IN THE FORUM,

618
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,332
I PROMISED MARTY THAT
IF WE GO TO NEXT TRIBAL,

619
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,835
AND IF HE'S ON THE OUTS,
THAT I WOULD GIVE HIM THE IDOL.

620
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:17,338
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY HE WOULD
GIVE IT TO ME.

621
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,008
SO ALL I'M ASKING IS TO WAIT
UNTIL THE NEXT ROUND.

622
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,010
IF YOU REALLY WANT MARTY OUT,
IT'S FINE.

623
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,804
BUT JUST DON'T MAKE ME GO BACK
ON MY WORD TONIGHT.

624
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,639
>> THEN WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
NEXT ROUND?

625
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,058
>> NO, IT'S ONLY FOR ONE TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

626
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,811
>> WELL, WHAT IF HE WINS
IMMUNITY THE NEXT TIME?

627
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,188
>> NO, IT'S ONLY TONIGHT.

628
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,023
'CAUSE I ONLY PROMISED HIM
THE NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

629
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:38,568
I GAVE HIM MY WORD,
AND I DON'T WANT TO,

630
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:41,154
I DON'T WANT TO START TO BREAK
PROMISES RIGHT AWAY.

631
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,530
>> WELL, GIVE ME THE IDOL.

632
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,990
I'LL HOLD IT, AND YOU DON'T HAVE
IT NO MORE.

633
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,826
>> BUT I THOUGHT THE PLAN
FROM THE BEGINNING...

634
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,870
>> THERE'S REALLY NO RUSH
TO TAKE OUT MARTY.

635
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,371
>> WELL, WHAT IF HE GETS
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY

636
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,080
THE NEXT THREE TIMES?

637
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,541
>> WHAT ABOUT THE IMMUNITY?

638
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,836
WE HAVE EIGHT MORE TIMES TO GO,
YOU KNOW?

639
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,380
>> HOW DO YOU WANT TO DO IT?

640
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,508
>> WELL, FOR THE LONGEST TIME
IT'S BEEN ALINA.

641
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:02,634
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.

642
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:05,887
I MEAN, LIKE I TOLD YOU
ALL THE TIME, JUST DON'T WORRY.

643
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,387
THERE'S NO NEED TO.

644
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,848
>> I AM HIS TARGET.

645
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,601
>> RIGHT, BUT WE'RE
YOUR ALLIANCE.

646
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,061
>> OKAY. THERE ARE A LOT OF
PEOPLE THAT WANT MARTY OUT,

647
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:16,731
BUT IT ALL GOES BACK TO SASH
MAKING SOME AGREEMENT WITH MARTY

648
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:19,067
WHEN HE GOT HIM TO GIVE THE IDOL
TO HIM WHEN HE WAS ON

649
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,946
THE LA FLOR TRIBE
SO HE COULD "GAIN TRUST."

650
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,031
MARTY'S ALWAYS A THREAT.

651
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,908
MARTY, TO ME,
IS THE BIGGEST THREAT,

652
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:30,912
SO I'M NOT VOTING FOR ALINA,
I'M NOT.

653
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,748
'CAUSE I DON'T FEEL RIGHT ABOUT
VOTING SOMEBODY OUT

654
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:36,584
THAT I DON'T THINK SHOULD BE
LEAVING RIGHT NOW.

655
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,221
>> ME?

656
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,055
>> YEAH.

657
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,223
>> BUT THAT'S JUST YOUR GUT.

658
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,235
>> NO, IT'S-IT'S NOT
A BLINDSIDE.

659
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,695
>> THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD DAN.

660
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:04,946
>> WHAT?

661
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,948
>> THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD DAN, I'M
BEING SET UP FOR A BLINDSIDE.

662
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:13,538
>> ALL THE NUMBERS, EVERYONE
I'VE SPOKEN TO, SAID IT'S ALINA.

663
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,791
>> CHASE IS NOW DEFINITELY,
IN MY BOOK, A MORON,

664
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:18,167
BECAUSE YOU DON'T GO TELL
SOMEONE

665
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,586
YOU'RE GONNA BLINDSIDE SOMEBODY

666
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:22,964
IF YOU HAVE AT LEAST FOUR OR
FIVE VOTES BEHIND YOU.

667
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,173
I MEAN, YOU DON'T EVEN BROACH
THE SUBJECT.

668
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,968
>> CHASE WENT UP TO DANNY

669
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,886
AND SAID WE'RE GONNA BLINDSIDE
MARTY TONIGHT.

670
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,222
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S TRYING
TO TURN ON-ON OUR-OUR GUYS.

671
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,682
>> YOU GUYS BLINDSIDE MARTY
TONIGHT?

672
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:33,683
>> THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD DANNY.

673
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,143
>> CHASE DIDN'T MENTION
ANY OF THAT TO ME, SO...

674
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,520
>> I JUST NEVER HEAR IT FROM
YOU.

675
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,480
I MEAN, I GIVE YOU ANY
INFORMATION I CAN.

676
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,107
I'M NOT A PLAYER IN THIS GAME.
I DON'T HAVE POWER.

677
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,110
I DON'T HAVE NUMBERS.
I DON'T HAVE AN IDOL ANYMORE.

678
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,778
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING.

679
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,531
THAT'S IT. I'M A ZERO THREAT,
SO TO PEOPLE TO EVEN SPEND

680
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,117
AN OUNCE OF ENERGY THINKING
ABOUT VOTING MARTY OFF IS CRAZY.

681
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,994
>> MARTY'S BEEN COMING UP TO ME
CONSTANTLY TODAY,

682
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,162
ALMOST TOO MUCH.

683
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,706
I THINK HE BELIEVES THAT HE'S ON
THE CHOPPING BLOCK,

684
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:59,167
WHICH ONLY BY BEING MORE AND
MORE PARANOID ON HIS PART,

685
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,629
IS HE REALLY PLACING A BIGGER
TARGET ON HIS BACK.

686
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:05,506
I THINK HIS BEST MOVE WOULD BE
TO LAY LOW,

687
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,301
BUT THAT'S NOT HIS STYLE,

688
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:11,346
AND HE'S ACTUALLY DIGGING
HIS OWN GRAVE AT THE MOMENT.

689
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,014
>> EVERYONE SAYS THEY'RE VOTING
FOR ALINA,

690
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,265
BUT THERE'S OTHER STUFF
GOING ON

691
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,225
THAT I THINK VOTES WILL BE CAST
AGAINST ME

692
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,894
AND PEOPLE WILL TRY TO GET ME.

693
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,312
>> NO, THEY ARE.
THEY'RE VOTING FOR ALINA.

694
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,022
I'VE HEARD "ALINA."
AND I'M TELLING YOU THAT...

695
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,106
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING.

696
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,651
BUT CAN I COUNT ON YOU,
SOUTH DAKOTA WORD OF HONOR

697
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:25,652
THAT YOU'LL VOTE
FOR ALINA TONIGHT?

698
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,737
>> I'M VOTING FOR ALINA.
THAT'S ALL I'VE HEARD.

699
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,198
>> BUT I HAVEN'T HEARD YOU SAY
THE SOUTH DAKOTA WORD OF HONOR.

700
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,659
>> THE SOUTH DAKOTA WORD
OF HONOR, I HEARD "ALINA."

701
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:33,618
>> THAT YOU'LL VOTE FOR ALINA.

702
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:38,039
>> BUT WE ARE STILL NOT GONNA
HAVE ENOUGH.

703
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,832
SASH IS NOT GONNA CHANGE HIS.

704
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,542
BRENDA'S NOT GONNA CHANGE HERS.

705
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,544
>> SEE, THOSE ARE THE TWO SPLITS
RIGHT NOW.

706
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,671
>> RIGHT.

707
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,047
>> SEE, I'M VOTING MARTY.

708
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,966
>> THAT MEANS THERE'S YOU, YOU,
KELLY PURPLE...

709
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,219
>> THE TWO RIGHT NOW THAT ARE
SPLIT VOTES IS SASH AND BRENDA.

710
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:54,514
SASH IS NOT GONNA GO BACK
ON HIS WORD.

711
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:57,183
>> OKAY, SO EVEN IF WE DON'T GET
SASH, THEN THAT'S FINE.

712
00:32:57,266 --> 00:33:02,855
HOLLY, JANE, ME, CHASE, KELLY
PURPLE, NAONKA.

713
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,024
THAT'S SIX.
IF WE CAN GET ONE MORE.

714
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,109
IF WE COULD GET FABIO.

715
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,324
>> WHAT'S UP?

716
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,618
>> SO I'VE BEEN TALKING TO
EVERYBODY, AND IT LOOKS

717
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,203
LIKE WE HAVE SIX PEOPLE TO VOTE
FOR MARTY,

718
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:20,206
AND WE NEED ONE MORE AND THAT
WILL BE SEVEN.

719
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:23,209
OBVIOUSLY, EVERYONE WANTS MARTY
GONE, IT'S JUST--

720
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,253
IS IT GOING TO BE ME OR HIM
FIRST?

721
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,212
AND I THINK IT SHOULD BE HIM
FIRST.

722
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,880
>> IT SHOULD BE NAONKA FIRST.

723
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:31,843
>> WELL, PLEASE DON'T THROW
A RANDOM NAONKA VOTE.

724
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,929
IF YOU WANT TO, VOTE NAONKA, YOU
DON'T HAVE TO BE PART

725
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:37,432
OF THE 6-6, AND FIVE WILL VOTE
FOR ME,

726
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,392
AND SIX WILL VOTE FOR MARTY.

727
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,394
IF YOU WANT TO BE STRATEGIC
ABOUT IT, IT WILL MAKE SENSE.

728
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,271
>> THIS IS WHY EVERYBODY WANTS
YOU OFF.

729
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,398
YOU'RE DANGEROUS.

730
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,400
>> I PLAY THE GAME SMART.

731
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,444
>> YEAH, BUT EVERY TIME YOU TALK
TO ANYBODY,

732
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,320
IT'S ALWAYS A HIDDEN MOTIVE.

733
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,573
>> HIDDEN MOTIVE?

734
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,657
>> THIS ISN'T SO HIDDEN BUT--

735
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,618
>> I'M GOING HOME TONIGHT OR I'M
GOING TO BUST MY ASS

736
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,786
TO NOT GO HOME TONIGHT.

737
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,747
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DO,
ROLL OVER?

738
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,915
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT.
NO, I DON'T.

739
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,084
>> I UNDERSTAND EVERYBODY THINKS
I'M DANGEROUS BUT IT'S EITHER

740
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,920
MY ASS IS GOING HOME TONIGHT OR
I'M GOING TO FIGHT FOR IT.

741
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:12,341
>> I WOULD PISS A LOT OF PEOPLE
OFF BY DOING THAT.

742
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,762
I DON'T KNOW, WHAT DO YOU WANT
ME TO SAY, TAKE MARTY OUT NOW

743
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:19,140
WHEN I'VE BEEN FRIENDS FOR MARTY
FOR A WHILE AND I GET ALONG

744
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,517
WITH HIM AND I ENJOY HIM AROUND
CAMP

745
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,311
AND SO DO A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE.

746
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:28,649
>> IT SEEMS TO ME WE GET ALONG,
TOO, BUT.

747
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,693
>> I, WELL...

748
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,061
>> Jeff: HOLLY, THIS IS IT NOW.

749
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,312
12 PEOPLE FOR A MILLION BUCKS.

750
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,356
CAN YOU SENSE THE GAME STARTING
TO CHANGE?

751
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,358
>> ABSOLUTELY.

752
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,318
I MEAN, PEOPLE WANT TO SAVE
THEMSELVES,

753
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:15,696
SO THEY'RE GOING TO DO ANYTHING
THAT THEY POSSIBLY CAN

754
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,365
TO GET TO THE END.

755
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,743
AND IF YOU JUST AGREE WITH WHAT
EVERYBODY ELSE SAYS,

756
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,370
THAT'S NOT GOING TO GET YOU TO
THE END.

757
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,331
YOU HAVE TO TAKE A RISK.

758
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,750
>> Jeff: MARTY, DO YOU FEEL AS
THOUGH BIG MOVES

759
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,710
ARE GOING TO START HAPPENING?

760
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,837
>> I ABSOLUTELY DO.

761
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,548
AND I THINK THE WINDOWS OF
OPPORTUNITY FOR BIG MOVES

762
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:36,217
SOMETIMES SHUT QUICKLY, AND
YOU'VE GOT TO SEIZE

763
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,427
THOSE OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE THEY
DON'T ALWAYS COME UP.

764
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:41,514
NOW, I JUST WANT TO CLEAR THE
AIR A LITTLE BIT

765
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,431
FOR THE WHOLE TRIBE AND
EVERYBODY HERE

766
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,351
BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SOME
MISCONCEPTION.

767
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,895
AND THE MISCONCEPTION WAS BY
MISS JANE

768
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,064
THEY EITHER DIDN'T LIKE MISS
JANE OR THAT

769
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:51,399
SOMEHOW I DIDN'T BOND WITH HER.

770
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,234
THE FACT IS, WITHIN 30 MINUTES
OF THE GAME STARTING,

771
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:56,404
JANE BEGAN A SERIES OF BAD
MISTAKES AND BAD DECISIONS--

772
00:35:56,487 --> 00:36:00,741
NAMELY, ALIGNING HERSELF WITH
THREE OF THE WEAKEST PLAYERS

773
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,409
THAT WERE SUBSEQUENTLY
ELIMINATED.

774
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,411
>> WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

775
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,914
I APPROACHED YOU, AND Y'ALL
FLUFFED ME OFF.

776
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,958
>> I DON'T MAKE AN ALLIANCE IN
30 MINUTE.

777
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,918
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW IF I'M STRONG
OR NOT, MARTY.

778
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,713
>> YOU LET THE LITTLE OLD LADY
FROM SOUTH CAROLINA

779
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:16,299
THAT CATCHES THE CATFISH.

780
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:21,429
IF SHE MAKES IT TO THE FINAL
THREE, IF YOU WATCH "SURVIVOR,"

781
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:24,599
THIS WOMAN WILL TAKE THE MILLION
DOLLARS.

782
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,101
SHE HAS THE SADDEST STORY OF
HUMAN TRAGIC LOSS,

783
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:29,729
OF NEEDING THE MONEY
DESPERATELY.

784
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,898
YOU CAN'T WRITE A BETTER STORY.

785
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,482
AND I WILL GO ONE STEP FURTHER,
AND THIS WILL BE THE LAST

786
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,444
COMPLIMENT I MAKE, BY THE WAY,
TO MISS JANE, IF JANE MAKES IT

787
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:40,406
TO THE FINAL THREE, I WILL CAST
MY VOTE FOR THIS WOMAN.

788
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:43,618
SHE WOULD DESERVE IT, AND THE
PEOPLE THAT ALLOWED HER

789
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,119
TO GET THERE MADE A STRATEGIC
ERROR.

790
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:46,579
THEY DON'T DESERVE THE MILLION
BUCKS.

791
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:49,123
IT'S JUST HONESTY.
IT'S THE GAME.

792
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:51,125
>> IT'S PERSONAL.

793
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:52,376
>> THERE'S NO PERSONAL OR
NOTHING.

794
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,296
I DON'T CARE IF PEOPLE ARE BLACK
WHITE, OLD, YOUNG,

795
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,340
EVERYONE'S WON THIS GAME--
GAY, STRAIGHT, WHATEVER.

796
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:00,760
IF YOU THINK SOMEONE IS GOING TO
TAKE A MILLION BUCKS OUT

797
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:04,472
OF YOUR POCKET, THAT'S WHAT
YOU'VE GOT TO BE THINKING ABOUT.

798
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,307
>> Jeff: ALINA, ON THE FLIP SIDE
COULD MARTY HAVE HURT HIMSELF

799
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:11,646
TONIGHT BY BEING SO VOCAL HARSH
ABOUT JANE?

800
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,981
>> I THINK HE'S ILLUSTRATING
PERFECTLY TO THIS TRIBE

801
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,109
WHAT A STRONG STRATEGIC PLAYER
HE IS AND HOW SMART HE IS

802
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,320
ABOUT THIS GAME BECAUSE HE JUST
POSED HIMSELF

803
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,988
AS THE BIGGEST THREAT OUT HERE.

804
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:26,994
DO YOU KEEP THAT GUY AROUND?

805
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,079
>> Jeff: DAN.

806
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:31,958
>> WE HAD TWO PEOPLE ON THIS
TRIBE STEAL OUR FOOD.

807
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,543
THEY TOOK THE BOWLS, THE COOKING
OIL, THE FRYING PAN,

808
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:38,339
THE FLOUR, AND THEY HID IT IN
THE WOODS.

809
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,382
>> Jeff: WHO WAS IT, DAN?

810
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:43,177
>> NAY AND ALINA TOOK THE FOOD.

811
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,471
>> Jeff: NAONKA AND ALINA, YOU
GUYS TOOK FOOD?

812
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,223
>> ME, IT WAS ME.

813
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,183
SHE WAS JUST WITH ME.

814
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:51,352
I ROBBED THE TRIBE, BUT I GAVE
IT BACK

815
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,520
BECAUSE I WAS PUSHED INTO A
CORNER.

816
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,523
BUT, I MEAN, I GAVE IT BACK.
NOBODY WAS HURT.

817
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,067
>> YOU WOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN IT
BACK IF WE HADN'T FOUND OUT.

818
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,986
>> JEFF, I GOT PUNISHED FOR...

819
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,029
>> YOU DIDN'T GET PUNISHED.

820
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:02,571
>> Jeff: HOW DID YOU GET
PUNISHED?

821
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,865
>> NOBODY TALK TO ME.

822
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,867
>> OH!

823
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,704
>> COME ON!

824
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,498
>> Jeff: ALINA, WHAT'S YOUR
CULPABILITY IN THIS?

825
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:14,500
>> I WAS PUT IN A REALLY WEIRD
POSITION.

826
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:18,921
DO I OUT HER FOR DOING SOMETHING
LIKE THAT AND TELLING EVERYBODY,

827
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:19,964
THAT'S INDICATING MYSELF, TOO.

828
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,216
THAT'S TAKING THE BLAME FOR
BEING PART OF IT,

829
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:24,552
AND I WAS FINE WITH DOING THAT
BECAUSE I WAS PART OF IT

830
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,721
AND I ADMIT MY GUILT TO IT.

831
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,890
>> Jeff: WHAT DO YOU DO TO GET
THE TARGET OFF YOUR BACK

832
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,685
AFTER BEING INVOLVED IN THIS
FOOD STEALING?

833
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:35,521
THE THING IS, JEFF, I'M A REALLY
GOOD SWING VOTE.

834
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:38,190
IF SOMEBODY NEEDS A NUMBER, HEY,
I'M A NUMBER.

835
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,401
IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS, IF YOU WANT
TO BE SMART STRATEGICALLY

836
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,903
IN THIS GAME YOU DON'T PICK
SOMEBODY WHO IS A POWERHOUSE.

837
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,072
YOU PICK SOMEBODY WHO IS A PAWN,

838
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:48,367
AND I'M A PAWN.

839
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,535
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, WELL THERE'S
CERTAINLY BEEN

840
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:50,494
A LOT SAID TONIGHT.

841
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,413
TIME TO FIND OUT HOW IT'S GOING
TO PLAY OUT.

842
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,790
JANE, FABIO.

843
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:55,666
YOU BOTH HAVE INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY.

844
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,877
I ASSUME YOU'RE BOTH GOING TO
KEEP IT.

845
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,129
YOU CANNOT VOTE FOR JANE, YOU
CANNOT VOTE FOR FABIO.

846
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,922
EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.

847
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:02,840
IT'S TIME TO VOTE.

848
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,842
JANE, YOU'RE UP.

849
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:14,185
>> I HOPE EVERYBODY IS SMART
TONIGHT.

850
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,663
>> IT'S EITHER ME OR YOU
TONIGHT,

851
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,832
SO LET THE BEST ARGUMENT WIN.

852
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:50,304
>> YOU A 100% GRADE "A" DIRT
SQUIRREL,

853
00:39:50,387 --> 00:39:52,348
AND IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO
HOME.

854
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,823
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

855
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,459
IF ANYBODY HAS
A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL

856
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:23,504
AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT, NOW
WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

857
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,970
ALL RIGHT, ONCE THE VOTES ARE
READ, THE DECISION IS FINAL.

858
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,263
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED

859
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,973
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.

860
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,975
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

861
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:39,770
FIRST VOTE, MARTY.

862
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:43,649
MARTY.

863
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:47,695
TWO VOTES MARTY.

864
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,363
ALINA.

865
00:40:49,446 --> 00:40:51,657
ONE VOTE ALINA.

866
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,868
ALINA.

867
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:58,164
TWO VOTES MARTY, TWO VOTES
ALINA.

868
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,999
ALINA.

869
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:03,544
THAT'S THREE VOTES ALINA, TWO
VOTES MARTY.

870
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,338
ALINA, FOUR VOTES ALINA,

871
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:09,550
TWO VOTES MARTY.

872
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,760
ALINA, THAT'S FIVE VOTES ALINA,

873
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:17,057
TWO VOTES MARTY.

874
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:21,729
ALINA, THAT'S SIX VOTES ALINA,
TWO VOTES MARTY.

875
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:26,609
NINTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE
FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

876
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:29,236
ALINA.

877
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,279
THAT'S SEVEN.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

878
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:32,323
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

879
00:41:38,495 --> 00:41:40,372
ALINA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

880
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:44,877
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

881
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,879
>> GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

882
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,930
>> Jeff: WELL, TONIGHT'S VOTE
WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE

883
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,766
THAT YOU ARE STILL MAKING
DECISIONS AS A GROUP

884
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,726
AND THAT KIND OF THINKING CAN'T
WORK FOREVER.

885
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:03,103
SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE.

886
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:03,646
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

887
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,689
GOOD NIGHT.

888
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,953
>> Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

889
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,624
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR."

890
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:24,833
>> IT SHOULD REALLY BE YOU AND
ME RUNNING THE SHOW.

891
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,670
>> Jeff: SASH AND BRENDA
STRUGGLE TO HOLD ON TO POWER.

892
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:30,297
>> PEOPLE NEED TO REMEMBER WHERE
THEIR PLACE IS.

893
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,590
>> Jeff: AND AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL...

894
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:32,132
>> I CAN SEE THROUGH MARTY.

895
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:32,800
>> LIKE MARTY SAID.

896
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,760
>> WAIT A MINUTE.

897
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:36,262
THIS IS CRAZY.

898
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,138
>> Jeff: NAONKA LETS HER FREAK
FLAG FLY.

899
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:41,350
NAONKA, I THINK I'M SPEECHLESS.

900
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,857
>> I WAS REALLY HOPING THAT I
WASN'T GONNA GO HOME.

901
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:49,817
WHY WOULD
THEY KEEP MARTY OVER ME?

902
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,945
ANYBODY WITH ANY SMARTS ABOUT
THIS GAME

903
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:53,779
WOULD'VE KEPT ME
INSTEAD OF MARTY.

904
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:56,115
IT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE.

905
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,825
HE'S SUCH A BIGGER THREAT
THAN I AM.

906
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:58,951
THESE PEOPLE ARE STUPID

907
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,828
AND I KNOW, EVENTUALLY,
THE FACT THAT THEY KEPT MARTY

908
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,205
IS GONNA BITE THEM
IN THE BUTT

909
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,498
AND THEY'RE GONNA TOTALLY
REGRET IT.

910
00:43:04,581 --> 00:43:05,958
STUPID MOVE.
