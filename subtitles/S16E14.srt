00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:04,045
>> JEFF PROBST: 36 days ago, ten

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:06,381
fans of<i> Survivor</i> were pitted

3
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:08,133
against ten of their favorite

4
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:10,468
players from seasons past.

5
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:11,761
>> You could be a fan of the

6
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:12,721
Boston Red Sox, man, but you

7
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:13,596
don't want to play against the

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,639
Boston Red Sox.

9
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:15,473
You're going to get your ass

10
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:16,349
handed to you.

11
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:32,532
>> JEFF: Let's get it on.

12
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:33,867
The tropical paradise of

13
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:34,784
Micronesia...

14
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,702
>> Got a big old four-foot

15
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:36,703
shark.

16
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,288
>> JEFF: ...proved to be both

17
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:43,001
bountiful and brutal.

18
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,210
The castaways were unexpectedly

19
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,628
battered by storms on a daily

20
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,797
basis.

21
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,132
>> You watch this show at home,

22
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,134
and when they show the rain,

23
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,177
they show it for, like, 30

24
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,136
seconds.

25
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,179
They're not showing that you're

26
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,889
standing in the rain for five,

27
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,307
six hours straight.

28
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,266
>> JEFF: The conditions were so

29
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:01,436
harsh that one castaway quit.

30
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,771
>> I can't be here one more

31
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:03,813
minute.

32
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,524
I can't take it.

33
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,525
>> Bye.

34
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,819
>> Bye.

35
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,281
>> JEFF: Throughout the game,

36
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,240
injuries piled up like never

37
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,116
before...

38
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,285
Our injury tally so far, Penner

39
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,871
has a busted-up knee, Parvati

40
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,081
has a busted-up lip, Ami has a

41
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,792
tweaked knee.

42
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,210
...forcing out two of the game's

43
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:28,713
strongest players.

44
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,216
>> I can only recommend, for the

45
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,509
sake of his leg and his life,

46
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,176
that he leaves the game now.

47
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,762
It's not going to get better.

48
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:39,015
>> Oh, god bless it.

49
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:40,809
>> JEFF: Let's get you out of

50
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,352
here and get you to a hospital.

51
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,186
It was the first time ever that

52
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,355
three players left without being

53
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,398
voted out.

54
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,358
But the game continued.

55
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,652
An early alliance was formed

56
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,445
between Amanda, Parvati, and

57
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,655
Cirie.

58
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:54,614
>> All right, ladies, I have

59
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:55,198
both of you guys' words that

60
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,992
it's us three to the end.

61
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:58,785
>> Yes.

62
00:01:58,868 --> 00:01:59,619
>> Yeah.

63
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:00,495
>> JEFF: The three women stayed

64
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,412
true to each other throughout

65
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,122
the entire game, but Parvati

66
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,374
made some side deals on her own.

67
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,209
>> I might just go ahead and

68
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,502
pull in Natalie and Alexis and

69
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,128
take them with me and Amanda and

70
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,171
Cirie.

71
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,631
Everyone else, they're dead to

72
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:12,215
me.

73
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,425
>> JEFF: All the women banded

74
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,760
together to form a super-

75
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:16,845
alliance which took control of

76
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,179
the game.

77
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,305
>> What is the plan?

78
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,306
>> Final five girls.

79
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,432
>> JEFF: The first thing on

80
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,433
their agenda was to blindside

81
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,685
the biggest threat.

82
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:24,978
>> This is, like, the perfect

83
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,312
opportunity to get rid of Ozzy,

84
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,355
because he'll never see it

85
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,107
coming.

86
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,649
>> JEFF: He had the hidden

87
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,568
immunity idol, but he didn't

88
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,318
play it.

89
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:36,364
Ozzy, the tribe has spoken.

90
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,366
But Ozzy's exit was just the

91
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,367
beginning.

92
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,583
>> It's like the black widow

93
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,418
brigade-- all the girls spinning

94
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,044
the guys around as much as we

95
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,087
can until they don't know which

96
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,171
way is up, and then we're

97
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:56,885
devouring them one at a time.

98
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,052
>> JEFF: What happened next was

99
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:58,595
an unprecedented series of

100
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,139
blindsides.

101
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,473
Jason had the idol, but the

102
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,808
women convinced him that he was

103
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,726
safe.

104
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:05,685
Jason.

105
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:06,311
So he didn't play it.

106
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,521
At the following tribal council,

107
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,064
because Erik had immunity, the

108
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,733
women were forced to vote out

109
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,401
one of their own.

110
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,861
They picked Amanda.

111
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:15,820
>> Pretty much everyone here has

112
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:16,654
told me they're voting for me

113
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:17,780
tonight.

114
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,073
>> JEFF: But when she produced

115
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,116
the hidden immunity idol...

116
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:20,450
>> I got it!

117
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,326
>> JEFF: ...the vote bounced

118
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,119
back to Alexis.

119
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,078
Alexis, you need to bring me

120
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,080
your torch.

121
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,290
And when Erik won immunity

122
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,374
again...

123
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,375
>> Nat, tell him if he were to

124
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,711
give you the necklace that would

125
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,922
redeem him, and we would vote

126
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:34,422
for Amanda.

127
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,299
>> Who would fall for that?

128
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,801
>> I want to give individual

129
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,011
immunity to Natalie.

130
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,220
>> JEFF: ...they pulled off the

131
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:41,846
biggest blindside in<i> Survivor</i>

132
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,765
history.

133
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:47,018
>> You officially go down as the

134
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:50,104
dumbest survivor ever.

135
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,481
>> JEFF: Erik, the tribe has

136
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,399
spoken.

137
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,277
Three days left in this game.

138
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,571
Who knows what is going to

139
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,948
happen?

140
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,115
Now four are left.

141
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,533
Cirie...

142
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,077
>> In this game for me, it's all

143
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,995
about who I think I can trust.

144
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,497
And if I feel that I can trust

145
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,666
you, then I'm willing to go all

146
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,209
the way with you.

147
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,293
But if I don't trust you, then

148
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,253
you can't believe a word I tell

149
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,380
you.

150
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,841
>> JEFF: ...Natalie...

151
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,802
>> I'm in game mode, and now I'm

152
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,553
actually having a lot more fun.

153
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:23,304
I'm getting to be more of

154
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,807
myself, which is proving to be

155
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,392
pretty ruthless and pretty

156
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,269
stone-cold bitch, and pretty

157
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,145
cutthroat.

158
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,647
>> JEFF: ...Amanda...

159
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,856
>> This is where the game gets

160
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,899
interesting.

161
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,109
This season I have developed

162
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,276
more personal relationships than

163
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,361
I did in China, and this game, I

164
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,113
played completely loyal and just

165
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,281
fought my way to the end.

166
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,449
>> JEFF: ...Parvati.

167
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,450
>> Coming back and playing

168
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,702
really aggressively, and pretty

169
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,120
much no holds barred for me.

170
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,371
So I haven't been here miserable

171
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,623
going through all this crap to

172
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,625
not win this game.

173
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,918
>> JEFF: Find out tonight who

174
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,128
will outlast all the rest to

175
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,462
become the sole survivor.

176
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,322
>> ♪ Final four, final four

177
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,742
final four, final four. ♪

178
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,576
>> When Erik paused, I was

179
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,369
like...

180
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:28,578
I know.

181
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,413
And I was like...

182
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,582
And he goes, "Well, this is

183
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,583
risky."

184
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,917
And I was like, "It's in the

185
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:35,710
bag.

186
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,837
It is in the bag!"

187
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,922
Everyone has fallen into our

188
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,966
trap.

189
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:42,967
Everyone.

190
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,093
And it's the same trap over and

191
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,762
over and over again.

192
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,055
And every single person keeps

193
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:47,513
falling into it.

194
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,599
>> When I wrote his name down, I

195
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,185
said, "My mama always told me

196
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,686
you might not be able to beat

197
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,354
them with these but you can

198
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,647
always beat them with this."

199
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,149
We couldn't beat Erik at

200
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:58,524
anything.

201
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,735
But now that's all taken care

202
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,278
of.

203
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:02,779
Erik's somewhere having a

204
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,781
sandwich, and we're going to

205
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:05,907
continue with the game.

206
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,033
>> That's four back-to-back

207
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,326
blindsides which you girls have

208
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:08,951
managed to evade every single

209
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:09,494
one of them.

210
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,370
>> Wow.

211
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,080
>> Like, let's see what happens

212
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,581
next.

218
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:20,857
How long have you been up for?

219
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,482
>> I don't know.

220
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,526
Probably an hour.

221
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,652
>> Did you sleep good?

222
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,736
>> Mm-hmm.

223
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,239
>> We were talking about Erik.

224
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:32,493
>> Oh, it's just tearing my

225
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,703
heart out that there aren't any

226
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,205
guys around here.

227
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,290
Can't you see the tears in my

228
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,542
eyes?

229
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,085
>> These guys just walk right

230
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:41,711
into the Venus flytrap, and they

231
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,714
get eaten alive.

232
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,174
>> Yeah.

233
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,383
>> Heist number four...

234
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:49,343
>> In a row.

235
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,262
>> ...goes off without a hitch.

236
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:51,888
>> I'm going to check and see if

237
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,514
my money is still in my pocket

238
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,849
around y'all.

239
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,184
I can't trust you.

240
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,810
I'm nervous around y'all.

241
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,688
>> I'm nervous around you.

242
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,674
>> Oh, my god!

243
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,009
That's so many!

244
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,802
Nice job, Parv.

245
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,012
>> I haven't missed the guys

246
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,514
here for one second.

247
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,097
I love having this group of

248
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,557
girls here, Just chilling,

249
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,226
hanging out, without the big

250
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,769
egos running around and the guys

251
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,687
trying to, you know, provide and

252
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,563
look cool in front of the

253
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,731
ladies.

254
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,650
I love just me and the girls.

255
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,526
>> This has been a really hard

256
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:47,777
season.

257
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,570
>> It's been so hard.

258
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,571
>> Because all the freaking

259
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:51,614
girls are smart girls in this

260
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,823
season.

261
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,283
>> I'm not kidding.

262
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,451
And we beat them out with our

263
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:56,535
brains.

264
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,579
I can't believe we beat those

265
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,622
guys.

266
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,750
>> Oh, my god.

267
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,753
I'm just so thankful to be here.

268
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,004
>> I'm so thankful that you're

269
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,464
here.

270
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,466
I feel like you have a way of,

271
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:11,008
like, convincing people, and

272
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,135
they're like, "You're so right."

273
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,428
You really should... you really

274
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,055
should swallow your pride and

275
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,181
ask for whatever you want all

276
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,057
the time.

277
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,016
>> I know.

278
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,434
I feel I live out of fear in my

279
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:20,810
normal life a lot.

280
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,521
I'm so scared of people saying

281
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,730
no, so I don't ask.

282
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,148
>> Yeah.

283
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,441
But your life could be so much

284
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,985
better if you just ask for

285
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,152
things that you want.

286
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:30,987
>> I know.

287
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:31,904
>> You know?

288
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:32,780
>> I know.

289
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:33,781
My position at this point, I'm

290
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:34,865
the only fan left.

291
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,200
They're all favorites.

292
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:36,784
They all started on a tribe

293
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,744
together.

294
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:39,870
But I've definitely made a

295
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,163
personal bond and connection

296
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,331
with Parvati.

297
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:42,707
We get each other.

298
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,085
We have great conversation.

299
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:46,752
So I think we complement each

300
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,879
other well.

301
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:49,964
>> Honestly, I think the people

302
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,008
that you encounter when you do

303
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,720
things like this, like, the

304
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,221
people that you're with, you

305
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,724
have to know that they are there

306
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,517
for a reason.

307
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,601
>> Yeah.

308
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,602
>> You know?

309
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,186
And there's a reason that you

310
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,521
and I are here together.

311
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:06,397
We have a one-in-four shot of

312
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,231
winning a million dollars right

313
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:07,982
now.

314
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,776
>> Yeah.

315
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,154
>> Unbelievable.

316
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,155
>> But everyone here has earned

317
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,031
their spot in the final three,

318
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,157
you know?

319
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,241
>> Absolutely.

320
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,159
>> Everyone here has played a

321
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,076
damn good game.

322
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,036
>> Yeah.

323
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,287
I think Parvati is an ally for

324
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:21,662
me in this game.

325
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,872
My conversations and my heart-

326
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,124
to-hearts with Parvati and our

327
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,917
great connection-- does it

328
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,545
benefit me at all if we're

329
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:31,797
closer than not?

330
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,216
Of course.

331
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,220
>> Tree mail!

332
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,597
>> What does it say?

333
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,765
>> Yeah, I was hoping for food.

334
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,391
>> Me, too.

335
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,809
>> Reward or immunity?

336
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:44,935
Does it say?

337
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,187
>> "Indeed you've accomplished a

338
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,396
noble task.

339
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:47,980
You've made it the final four.

340
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,732
To climb the heights of victory,

341
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,318
you need to scramble once more."

342
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,486
>> What?

343
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,737
>> It's immunity.

344
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,113
Today?

345
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,239
>> Wow.

346
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:57,823
>> I am not happy.

347
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,700
>> We're thinking that winning

348
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,786
this challenge is pretty much

349
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,746
guaranteed final three.

350
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,707
So we have to beat Natalie.

351
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,000
I mean, we love the fact that

352
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,877
it's all women, but being that

353
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,337
it's all women, one of us has to

354
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,756
go.

355
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,533
>> JEFF: Four ladies feeling oh

356
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:44,161
so good about themselves.

357
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:44,787
You guys ready to get to today's

358
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,872
immunity challenge?

359
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:47,790
>> Yep.

360
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:48,332
>> JEFF: First things first.

361
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:48,916
Natalie, I'll take back that

362
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,918
necklace.

363
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,009
Once again, immunity is back up

364
00:11:59,093 --> 00:11:59,802
for grabs.

365
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,929
For today's challenge, you will

366
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,765
start on a very small perch at

367
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,017
the top of a 20-foot pole in the

368
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,102
water.

369
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,311
On my go, you will use a bucket

370
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,355
to gather water that you will

371
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,399
then pour into a bamboo chute.

372
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,900
As the water fills up the chute,

373
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:15,776
it will raise a set of keys.

374
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,862
You'll take those keys, you'll

375
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,530
swim back to shore and use them

376
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,991
to unlock a chest containing 16

377
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,827
individually shaped ladder

378
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,829
rungs.

379
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,330
The first person to correctly

380
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,790
assemble their ladder, climb to

381
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,417
the top, and raise their flag,

382
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,335
wins immunity, guaranteed a one-

383
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,795
in-three shot at winning this

384
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,213
game.

385
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,506
Make sense?

386
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,632
>> Yep.

387
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,425
>> Yep.

388
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,134
>> JEFF: We'll draw for

389
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:40,926
position.

390
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,429
We'll get started.

391
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,692
Here we go, for immunity and a

392
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:57,276
guaranteed spot in the final

393
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,069
three.

394
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,573
Survivors ready?

395
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,284
Go.

396
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:05,993
Going to pull up that bucket

397
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,621
full of water, and then pour it

398
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,916
down that bamboo chute.

399
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:14,251
The more water you get in, the

400
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,212
faster you will raise those keys

401
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,797
up to where you can grab them.

402
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:31,435
Natalie having a lot of success.

403
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,061
Parvati got most of it in the

404
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,396
chute.

405
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,856
Doesn't matter how fast you pull

406
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,982
up the water if you don't pour

407
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,985
it in the chute.

408
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,785
Natalie doing a great job.

409
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,037
Can't quite reach her keys.

410
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,122
Parvati and Natalie neck and

411
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,041
neck right now.

412
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,175
Natalie has her keys.

413
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,344
She's in the water.

414
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,225
Parvati very close.

415
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:14,562
Parvati reaching for her keys.

416
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,980
Parvati unclips.

417
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,024
She's in the water.

418
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,818
Got to get to shore and open

419
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:21,944
that chest.

420
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,697
Amanda reaching for those keys.

421
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,156
Can't do it.

422
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,324
Going to take another bucket of

423
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,909
water.

424
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,119
Natalie and Parvati with a big

425
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,537
lead at this point.

426
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,748
Both opening their chests up.

427
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,008
Amanda has her set of keys.

428
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:47,386
Got to unclip.

429
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,638
She's in the water.

430
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,018
Cirie, is it close enough?

431
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,144
Cirie reaches for the keys.

432
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,146
Cirie has her keys!

433
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:01,900
Get in that water.

434
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,695
Everybody is in this.

435
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:05,988
Natalie continues to extend her

436
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,865
lead.

437
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,450
This ladder will take some time

438
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,952
to assemble.

439
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,746
Only one person going to walk

440
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,080
away from here with immunity.

441
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,498
The other three vulnerable at

442
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,168
tonight's tribal council.

443
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,838
You have 16 ladder rungs.

444
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:25,466
Each ladder rung is individually

445
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,468
shaped and will only go into one

446
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:30,262
slot on that ladder.

447
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,847
If you have to force it, it's

448
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:32,973
not right.

449
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,099
If you have a lot of play, it's

450
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,061
not right.

451
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,396
16 different options, but it

452
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,065
only goes together one way.

453
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,031
Amanda appears to be making some

454
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,659
progress.

455
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,077
Parvati's got some rungs in her

456
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,286
ladder.

457
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,412
Natalie and Cirie trying to make

458
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,080
sure they're right.

459
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,540
Merely getting to the top is not

460
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,084
enough.

461
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,002
Amanda making a lot of progress.

462
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,713
If she's right, that's a big

463
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,549
lead.

464
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,343
Parvati skipping up ahead.

465
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,969
Putting some of the higher

466
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,721
ladder rungs in first.

467
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,306
Cirie is working her way up

468
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,810
methodically from the bottom.

469
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,478
Natalie having a little trouble

470
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,938
with this puzzle.

471
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,064
Amanda pulling away from the

472
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,693
pack.

473
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,194
At this point, it is Amanda's

474
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,987
challenge to lose.

475
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:32,366
She has a huge lead.

476
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,787
Amanda can't get that last rung

477
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,122
in.

478
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,123
Something's not right.

479
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,291
Amanda going now rung by rung

480
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,668
trying to figure out where she's

481
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,586
off.

482
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,673
Natalie getting closer.

483
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:51,176
Amanda swapping pieces out.

484
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,846
Immunity so close.

485
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,226
Amanda thinks she has it, and

486
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,060
she does.

487
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:04,481
Amanda wins immunity!

488
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,526
>> Good job, girl.

489
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,278
>> Good job.

490
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,946
>> Oh, my god!

491
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:11,321
>> Good job, girl.

492
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,158
That was tough.

493
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,201
>> JEFF: Amanda, come on over.

494
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:21,290
Congratulations.

495
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,708
>> Thank you.

496
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,292
>> JEFF: Guaranteed a one-in-

497
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,544
three shot at winning this game

498
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,837
and the million bucks that goes

499
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,880
with it.

500
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,006
Natalie, Cirie, Parvati, after

501
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,841
37 hard-fought days, one of you

502
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,801
will not make it to the final.

503
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,385
Figure out who that's going to

504
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,262
be tonight at tribal council.

505
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,263
Grab your stuff, head out.

506
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,348
See you at tribal.

507
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,916
>> The only reason you beat me

508
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:04,833
is because your legs are longer

509
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:05,959
than mine.

510
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,002
>> Right.

511
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:07,878
>> Me, too.

512
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:08,670
>> I was right hot on your

513
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,421
trail.

514
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,547
>> Oh, I know, girl.

515
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:14,051
>> We all were.

516
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,469
>> I'm in the final three.

517
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,012
I can't believe it.

518
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:17,513
I'm really, like... I'm

519
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,515
ecstatic.

520
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,974
And that's, like, twice in a

521
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,184
row.

522
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,685
And this time I have played my

523
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,103
game so different, and I feel so

524
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,232
much better about it.

525
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,652
>> We could set Gloria free.

526
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,618
>> You know, they always talk

527
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:40,619
about the lowest man on the

528
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:41,495
totem pole.

529
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,704
I do indeed feel like the low

530
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,915
woman on the totem pole.

531
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,917
But am I just going to tuck my

532
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,543
tail between my legs and scurry

533
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,211
out of here and say, "Bye, guys,

534
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,379
well, it was great, I'm going

535
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,756
home"?

536
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,132
No, I'm going to explore all my

537
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,843
options.

538
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,719
If Gloria is anything like the

539
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,346
women on this camp, she'll mate

540
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,473
with that dude and then rip his

541
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,268
neck off.

542
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,812
>> Oh, that's funny.

543
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:07,437
>> I'm dealing women who are as

544
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,397
smart as I am.

545
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,482
So if I go in and I'm hustling

546
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,900
and I'm shaking and I'm moving

547
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,861
and I'm stressing, they're going

548
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:14,403
to see right through it.

549
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,446
So I think if I'm calm, cool,

550
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,865
and collected there's a way to

551
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,241
weasel in and communicate with

552
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,909
them in a way that may seem

553
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,163
reasonable.

554
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,635
>> This sucks.

555
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,720
I hate when it gets to this

556
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,513
point.

557
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,931
Why can't we all just stay?

558
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:43,849
Why can't they have a final

559
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:44,933
four?

560
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:45,392
>> That would be cool.

561
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:50,439
>> I don't know, Natty, girl.

562
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,149
I don't know.

563
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,567
Have you promised anybody your

564
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,068
vote?

565
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,446
Oh, good.

566
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,364
>> No.

567
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:03,785
>> Good.

568
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,828
>> I believe Cirie is quite

569
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,038
nervous as far as jury votes are

570
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:06,371
concerned.

571
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,290
I could use this to address

572
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,043
Parvati to help me out.

573
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,586
It's kind of a little glimmer at

574
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,087
the end of the tunnel, a little

575
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,088
light, because I do firmly

576
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,006
believe that Parvati would go

577
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,133
out on a limb for me.

578
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,388
>> Huh?

579
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,389
>> How good of a shot do we have

580
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,224
to win this, do you think?

581
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,100
>> Huge.

582
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:27,893
>> Yeah?

583
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:28,727
>> You and I?

584
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,519
I think it's between you and I.

585
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,270
>> Really?

586
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,147
>> Mm-hmm.

587
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,523
>> Definitely.

588
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,613
>> It's been kind of our plan

589
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,865
from pretty much the beginning

590
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,200
to have me, Parv and Cirie in

591
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,743
the final three.

592
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:45,369
But I think Cirie is definitely

593
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,829
a threat as far as swaying

594
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:48,413
votes from the jury one way or

595
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,374
the other.

596
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,583
And I don't want Natalie to go.

597
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,751
I think, you know, she

598
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:53,627
definitely deserves to be here.

599
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,670
I think she's played a good

600
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,420
game.

601
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:59,883
Cirie, she knows that if Natalie

602
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:00,509
would have won, Nat would have

603
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,719
voted with me and you and Cirie

604
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,554
would have been gone.

605
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,889
>> True.

606
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:06,848
>> I don't know who I'm voting

607
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,683
for tonight.

608
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,558
I mean, it's hard.

609
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,685
It's far in the game.

610
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,061
You know, it's not easy.

611
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:11,603
You know everyone is still

612
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,814
playing the game at this point.

613
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,107
It would be stupid not to still

614
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,524
be playing the game.

615
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,484
>> I give Natalie so much

616
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,527
credit.

617
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,528
>> Me, too.

618
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,029
>> Cirie got lucky to be with

619
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,406
us.

620
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,871
>> Yeah.

621
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,717
>> You okay?

622
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,971
>> Mm-hmm.

623
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,764
>> I was like...

624
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,182
"No.

625
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,809
You're asking me this right now

626
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,186
because..."

627
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:00,610
>> I love Natalie to death, and

628
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,362
I think she's a lesser threat as

629
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,364
far as jury votes than Cirie.

630
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,534
And now the time has come where

631
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,578
it's, like, I could switch it up

632
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,247
now, and then we have our

633
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,540
biggest jury threat out of the

634
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,208
game.

635
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,460
But, seriously, in this game,

636
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:19,254
and how this game's been played

637
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:20,547
all these women are so crafty, I

638
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,049
wouldn't put it past any single

639
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,759
one of us to work some kind of

640
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,427
deal out and make it to the

641
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:30,474
three.

642
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,017
>> Yeah.

643
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,436
>> Yeah.

644
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,694
>> I could be going home

645
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,029
tonight.

646
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,030
They could have made a deal with

647
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:45,864
Natalie and decided, "You know

648
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:46,656
what?

649
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,158
We like you better.

650
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:48,492
Cirie's out."

651
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,576
And smiling in my face.

652
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,995
I saw their work already.

653
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:58,293
We duped so many people....

654
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:00,837
>> ...with straight faces.

655
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,650
>> JEFF: We'll now bring in the

656
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,486
members of our jury.

657
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:28,990
Eliza, Ozzy, Jason, James,

658
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:32,285
Alexis, and Erik, voted out at

659
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,496
the last tribal council.

660
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:46,675
So we have a final four

661
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,678
consisting of only women.

662
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,346
And all of you women have been

663
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,014
involved in another first-- four

664
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,100
straight blindsides.

665
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,060
Natalie, after the performance

666
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,937
from the four of you at the last

667
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,355
tribal council, you all should

668
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:01,940
be nominated for a<i> Survivor</i>

669
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,025
Academy Award.

670
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,153
It was masterful to watch.

671
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:09,990
>> No disrespect to anyone, but

672
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:10,532
it went down seamlessly.

673
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:14,077
We achieved an impossible task.

674
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,453
So it was a great feeling.

675
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,998
>> JEFF: So after four straight

676
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,541
blindsides, what's the feeling

677
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,668
going into tonight's vote?

678
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:24,462
>> I think at this point, the

679
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,589
four of us respect each other

680
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:26,798
enough that I don't think there

681
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,133
would be a blindside.

682
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,510
I would pray for a blindside on

683
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,137
some level.

684
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,096
Like now it would actually

685
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,181
benefit me better than all the

686
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,640
other four.

687
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,267
>> JEFF: Amanda, how concerned

688
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,852
are you tonight that you know

689
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,645
exactly what's happening?

690
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,772
>> At this point, Jeff, I have

691
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:43,732
no idea what's going on.

692
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,567
I mean, how many times does a

693
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,819
blindside have to happen before

694
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:48,570
you figure out that you know

695
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,198
nothing about what's going on at

696
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:51,740
all?

697
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,034
I'm fairly confident that I know

698
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:54,659
what's going to happen tonight,

699
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,662
but I can't be certain.

700
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,247
>> JEFF: Parvati, it seems to me

701
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,249
only a fool would say anything

702
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,418
with confidence at tribal

703
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:04,544
council.

704
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:05,837
All you have to do is look

705
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,547
across at Ozzy, and Jason, and

706
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:11,635
Alexis, and Erik.

707
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,094
They were all certain they

708
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,221
weren't going home.

709
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,430
>> Yeah, I think this has been

710
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:18,725
the craziest, messiest, most

711
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,560
strategic game in the history of

712
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,187
<i>Survivor.</i>

713
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,647
So for anyone to feel confident,

714
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,065
it's ludicrous.

715
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,524
But I can't read anyone's mind,

716
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,567
and I don't know what anyone

717
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,361
else is thinking but myself.

718
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,946
>> JEFF: Amanda, have you guys

719
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,114
talked about, "What do we do

720
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,282
when there are only three people

721
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,617
left?"

722
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,993
Or have you been assuming,

723
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,078
"That's all I've got to do is

724
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,162
just get to final three and I'm

725
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,039
good to go"?

726
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,123
>> No one here, I think I can

727
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,335
honestly say that, is expecting

728
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,544
a final two.

729
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,420
At this point in the game, it

730
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,296
would take us for another

731
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,214
whirlwind.

732
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,173
>> JEFF: Cirie, how would it

733
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,549
change the game if you knew it

734
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,260
was a final two?

735
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,636
>> I mean, it is nerve-wracking

736
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,638
to think it could be a final

737
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,473
two, because that makes me feel

738
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:01,393
like, once again, I'm on the

739
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,270
bottom of the alliance, which is

740
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,272
not a good place to be, Jeff.

741
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,439
>> I just have a question-- when

742
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,899
did you ever think you were on

743
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:08,650
the bottom of the alliance?

744
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,152
>> No, no, no, from the five,

745
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:11,736
when I started with you, Ozzy,

746
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,114
James, and Parvati, basically,

747
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,240
it's unspoken that I'm on the

748
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:15,740
bottom.

749
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,451
Ozzy wanted you four to be in

750
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:18,827
the final four.

751
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,870
So where does that place me when

752
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:21,621
we're going to the five?

753
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,664
That makes me fifth.

754
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,541
>> I'm talking about after the

755
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:25,292
merge.

756
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,167
Like, when have you felt on the

757
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,252
bottom?

758
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,086
>> Always.

759
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,296
>> Always?

760
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,755
>> Between us three?

761
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,715
It's obvious, because not one

762
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,758
person in any alliance has ever

763
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:37,470
said, "I won't vote for Cirie."

764
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:38,638
You have said, "I won't vote

765
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:39,764
for" certain people.

766
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:40,765
She has said, "I won't vote for

767
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,017
you."

768
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,435
So that clearly places me at the

769
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,728
bottom of the alliance.

770
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:45,979
>> I'm just wondering.

771
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,188
>> And I'm explaining how I feel

772
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:47,814
that way.

773
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,941
I would be foolish not to think

774
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,485
that.

775
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,448
>> JEFF: Natalie, you're holding

776
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,991
back a big grin.

777
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,242
>> I think at this point,

778
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,410
anything's an opportunity.

779
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:01,619
You know, I'm just letting them

780
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:05,123
duke it out, and may the best

781
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,750
woman win.

782
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,710
>> JEFF: All right, let's get to

783
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:09,794
the vote.

784
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:10,837
Amanda, you have the immunity

785
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,838
necklace, you're not planning on

786
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:12,714
giving it to anyone else, are

787
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:12,881
you?

788
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:13,840
>> No.

789
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,967
>> JEFF: You cannot vote for

790
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:16,760
Amanda.

791
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:17,344
Everybody else is fair game.

792
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:17,761
It is time to vote.

793
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,722
Amanda, you're up.

794
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,178
>> JEFF: I'll go tally the

795
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,722
votes.

796
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,361
Once the votes are read, the

797
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,320
decision is final.

798
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,238
The person voted out will be

799
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,280
asked to leave the tribal

800
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,407
council area immediately.

801
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:24,077
I'll read the votes.

802
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,621
First vote, Cirie.

803
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,670
Natalie.

804
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:34,212
One vote Natalie, one vote

805
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,840
Cirie.

806
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,010
Natalie.

807
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:41,845
Two votes Natalie, one vote

808
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,847
Cirie.

809
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,393
14th person voted out and the

810
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:48,977
seventh member of our jury,

811
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,769
Natalie.

812
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,563
That's three.

813
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:52,272
That's enough.

814
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,482
You need to bring me your torch.

815
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:09,873
Natalie, the tribe has spoken.

816
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:14,961
Time for you to go.

817
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,599
Well, once again you have

818
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,184
survived the vote and made it to

819
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,560
the final three.

820
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:31,644
Congratulations.

821
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:32,604
Grab your torches, head back to

822
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:33,521
camp.

823
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,064
Good night.

824
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,197
>> I have to say that I am

825
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,239
pretty happy with the way that I

826
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,199
played the game.

827
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:44,949
I was the last fan standing.

828
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:48,369
And I feel proud of the group of

829
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,121
girls they finished with.

830
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,498
I respect the way that you guys

831
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,499
played the game with me.

832
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,084
So thank you.

833
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,397
>> That was a weird tribal

834
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,815
tonight, wasn't it?

835
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:18,942
>> I don't think I've ever been

836
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,693
so exhausted in my entire life.

837
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,070
>> You and me both.

838
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,365
>> What am I doing?

839
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,241
>> You were trying to make us

840
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,367
look so awful at tribal.

841
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,451
>> How?

842
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,161
You asked me how I think I'm on

843
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,121
the bottom of an alliance, and I

844
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,748
explained to you every single

845
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:35,500
alliance that I've been in how

846
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,585
I'm on the bottom.

847
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,836
>> That's bull(<i> no audio</i> )

848
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,170
Just be real.

849
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,090
>> How is it bull (<i> no audio</i> )?

850
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,341
That's not game.

851
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:44,842
That's real facts.

852
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,386
That's exactly what this is.

853
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,595
I should be...

854
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,221
>> Because in the five, how are

855
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,098
you on the outs?

856
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,599
>> Because you're snuggled up

857
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,976
over there with James, she's

858
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,143
snuggled up over there with

859
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,061
Ozzy.

860
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:55,937
Most of the time y'all four are

861
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,187
together.

862
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,105
If you were me, what would you

863
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,023
feel?

864
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,733
I mean, be me for a minute.

865
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:01,359
And because I said it out loud,

866
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,403
you're upset?

867
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,696
With this alliance with y'all

868
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:05,905
two, she told me she couldn't

869
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,198
vote you.

870
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,283
So that makes me at the bottom

871
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,617
of this alliance.

872
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,202
Have any one of you ever said,

873
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:11,995
"I can't vote Cirie out?"

874
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,080
>> How do you know?

875
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:14,956
>> Yes or no?

876
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:15,290
I'm asking you.

877
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,624
>> How do you know?

878
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,458
>> Have I talked to you about

879
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:17,917
final two?

880
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,169
I feel that I've been at the

881
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,087
bottom of every single alliance.

882
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,214
>> I just don't see that, and I

883
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,007
haven't seen that.

884
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:24,632
I haven't seen that the whole

885
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,800
game.

886
00:31:25,883 --> 00:31:26,467
>> You're not me.

887
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,218
You're not me.

888
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,219
That's why you can't see it.

889
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,929
>> I can't understand you when

890
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:30,972
you're screaming at me.

891
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,640
>> Okay, I'm not screaming.

892
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:33,683
>> Thank you.

893
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:34,892
>> I can't explain it any more.

894
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,394
I don't know how else to say it.

895
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:37,562
>> Yeah, I know.

896
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:38,813
I mean, it makes sense.

897
00:31:38,896 --> 00:31:41,482
>> I know.

898
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,609
I'm sorry.

899
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:43,610
>> I'm sorry for yelling at you,

900
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:44,652
but don't...

901
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,486
>> No, I know.

902
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,321
I'm just...

903
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,155
>> ...accuse me of stuff that

904
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,072
I'm...

905
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:48,990
>> I wasn't trying to accuse

906
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:49,157
you.

907
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:49,991
It came out very badly, and I'm

908
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,951
sorry.

909
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:52,994
I'm just on my breaking point

910
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,705
right now.

911
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,585
>> I know.

912
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:01,461
>> You have two more days.

913
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:02,003
>> I know.

914
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,963
>> Let me give you a hug,

915
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,798
because this is pitiful for us

916
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:06,424
to make it this far and then you

917
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,176
be...

918
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,135
>> I know, I'm sorry.

919
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,094
>> No, it's all right.

920
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,012
It's all right.

921
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,181
>> I didn't mean it like that.

922
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,432
I just kind of broke down and I

923
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,517
started yelling at Cirie about

924
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,353
stupid things that I don't even

925
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,313
know why I yelled.

926
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,106
And it's...I feel like I've been

927
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,901
doing this forever, you know?

928
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:25,485
Straight from China, I come

929
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,445
here, and it just... I just

930
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,822
can't take it.

931
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:30,365
I almost lost it when Jeff

932
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,533
mentioned that there might be a

933
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,619
final two, and I lost it.

934
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:35,119
>> Oh!

935
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,038
>> There's no way it would be a

936
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,415
final two.

937
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,792
There's no way.

938
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:41,376
>> Yeah, don't say that again,

939
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,044
Parv, because you've been wrong

940
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,253
every time.

941
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,254
You don't comfort me by saying

942
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,923
that.

943
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,383
It's been the plan from day one

944
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,801
for Parvati, Amanda, myself to

945
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,302
be final three, and it would

946
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,554
just break my heart to find out

947
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,848
it's going to be a final two.

948
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:59,477
So I want to celebrate, but

949
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,144
there's, like, that hint in the

950
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,730
back of my mind-- don't get

951
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,273
falsely happy and then find out

952
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,275
this is not the end of it.

953
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,568
>> It's the final three.

954
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,653
Everybody just needs to chill

955
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:09,987
out.

956
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,030
>> Did you find a machete?

957
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,073
Because all that yelling makes

958
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,617
me thirsty.

959
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,089
>> 38 days.

960
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,632
I really don't think I will ever

961
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:30,758
touch a coconut again.

962
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,302
>> We need a tree mail here.

963
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,930
>> Relax.

964
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:39,308
>> I am ecstatic to be here in

965
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,518
the final three with these two

966
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:41,477
girls.

967
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,645
At least we assume it's a final

968
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,855
three.

969
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:47,275
It's been a long road, and we

970
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,776
feel very blessed to be here

971
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,110
with each other.

972
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,111
Come on out.

973
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,280
>> Come on, Gloria.

974
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,323
>> We're celebrating by setting

975
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,200
our mascot free, Gloria.

976
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,076
She's our last chicken standing.

977
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,078
>> Get out of there!

978
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,205
>> Yay!

979
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,167
>> Uh-oh!

980
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,127
Rather than try to kill Gloria

981
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,962
and have her flopping around

982
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:10,006
in misery, we decided we can not

983
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:13,009
eat.

984
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:13,926
We only have a couple of days

985
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:14,886
left.

986
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:15,803
Let Gloria go.

987
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:16,888
She might not leave here.

988
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:17,305
This is her home.

989
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:21,309
She's making a nest to lay the

990
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,269
damn egg.

991
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:25,438
>> Unfortunately, Gloria doesn't

992
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:26,314
want to leave camp.

993
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,441
She's, like, hanging around.

994
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,818
She's like a pet dog now.

995
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:31,444
I guess she doesn't realize that

996
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,488
this is over.

997
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,573
It's a done deal.

998
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,417
>> We're the craftiest survivors

999
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:47,877
of all time, to be modest.

1000
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,920
>> Nice.

1001
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,755
Nice.

1002
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,924
>> What is it?

1003
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,217
It doesn't look like food.

1004
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,426
>> No.

1005
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,385
>> What?

1006
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,595
Oh, my...

1007
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,847
>> It looks like a challenge.

1008
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,558
Freaking paddle.

1009
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,060
All right.

1010
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:06,229
"Congratulations, final three.

1011
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:09,649
You have done what 17 of your

1012
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,150
fellow tribesmen and women could

1013
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,985
not.

1014
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,278
Today you will honor their

1015
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,114
memories before proceeding to

1016
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,074
your final immunity challenge.

1017
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:19,367
Get into your boat and head out

1018
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,078
to Exile Island.

1019
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,579
There you will find the torches

1020
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:24,956
of your fallen comrades.

1021
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,499
Reflect upon them as they each

1022
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:27,959
had a part in getting you to

1023
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,585
this point.

1024
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,045
You'll then proceed to your

1025
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:31,546
final immunity challenge."

1026
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,840
>> Oh, my god.

1027
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,509
>> Wow.

1028
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:41,764
>> My heart just dropped.

1029
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,600
>> All right, let's go, ladies.

1030
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,186
>> We got tree mail today, and

1031
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,064
we thought there was going to be

1032
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:51,107
like, food, you know, for the

1033
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,358
final three.

1034
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:55,570
And it's another immunity

1035
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,405
challenge.

1036
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,531
It's like, when is it going to

1037
00:35:58,614 --> 00:35:59,407
end, you know?

1038
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,241
Like, there's only so much you

1039
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:00,825
can take, and then someone has

1040
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,410
to leave now, like, after

1041
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,036
everything.

1042
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,079
I am so tight with these girls.

1043
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,247
Like, this just sucks

1044
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,875
completely.

1045
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:18,467
>> It's never ending.

1046
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,888
>> I feel sick.

1047
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,056
>> Me, too.

1048
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,267
The fact that it's a final two

1049
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,145
and not a final three was almost

1050
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:29,437
poetic.

1051
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,148
I mean, we've been blindsiding

1052
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,608
people left and right, and

1053
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,401
essentially we got blindsided.

1054
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,360
We thought we had it made.

1055
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,071
I guess, you know, what goes

1056
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,281
around comes around.

1057
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,826
>> Okay.

1058
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,453
...regroup, get it together.

1059
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,288
>> One more time.

1060
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,415
>> I need to regroup.

1061
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,541
Now we have to kick it back into

1062
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,584
gear and get ready for this

1063
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:52,710
immunity challenge today.

1064
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,086
And for me, it's taken me down a

1065
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,421
peg.

1066
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,256
Like, I feel a little bit

1067
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:57,465
humbled.

1068
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,341
But I think the rites of passage

1069
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,383
will give me a little

1070
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,844
perspective, because it's a

1071
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,387
chance for us to honor everyone

1072
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,431
that we fought so hard to beat,

1073
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:06,933
and I think we all want to give

1074
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:07,516
those people credit for being

1075
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,644
such strong competitors and for

1076
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,271
not making it easy on us.

1077
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:19,362
>> I can't feel bad.

1078
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,363
Look how far I made it.

1079
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:20,988
I mean, we started out with 20

1080
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,448
people.

1081
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:23,741
And they were all hard-core

1082
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,369
players, and would love to be

1083
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,954
here right now.

1084
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:31,040
So I want to tip my hat to them

1085
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:31,666
and say, you know, "Good job.

1086
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:35,628
I beat you, but good job."

1087
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,772
>> Oh, thank god.

1088
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:55,398
He was actually kind of a decent

1089
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:58,234
guy while he lasted.

1090
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:00,695
Let's do it.

1091
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,072
>> I consider myself the

1092
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:05,408
cerebral assassin of<i> Survivor.</i>

1093
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,451
And I'm not going at 100%, I'm

1094
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,911
not playing.

1095
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,121
So, you know, to go out on my

1096
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,205
own terms, I kind of protected

1097
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:12,248
the legacy of Jonny Fairplay.

1098
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,625
So I'm very happy with that.

1099
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,088
>> Oh, Mary.

1100
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:22,425
Didn't really know Mary.

1101
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,552
>> That's probably the worst

1102
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,886
thing that could ever happen to

1103
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:26,971
somebody on<i> Survivor,</i> is being

1104
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,306
one of the first people voted

1105
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:28,723
out of your tribe.

1106
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,433
Maybe I was a strong player and

1107
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,309
they saw me as a threat, but I

1108
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,853
really felt like just a ton of

1109
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:36,522
bricks hit me, and game over.

1110
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,233
>> Yau-Man.

1111
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,902
Cirie's fiercest competitor.

1112
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,279
>> That's only reason he had to

1113
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:43,904
go so early is because he was

1114
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,448
such a great player.

1115
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,658
>> When I first walked in and

1116
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,326
someone said that I'm one of the

1117
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,536
most likable players, I think

1118
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:53,330
that pretty much sets me apart

1119
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,207
as a big target.

1120
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,584
Also, my problem, I know, is

1121
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,961
that I don't have that, you know

1122
00:38:59,045 --> 00:38:59,587
killer instinct to go up against

1123
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,131
some of these other people.

1124
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:05,426
But even though I got voted out

1125
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,844
so early, it's still quite a fun

1126
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,512
experience.

1127
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,849
>> Oh, Mikey.

1128
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,851
>> Good old Mikey B.

1129
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,603
He was a fierce competitor.

1130
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,980
>> It hurts.

1131
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,648
It hurts to get sent home that

1132
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,441
early in the game.

1133
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,484
I was having fun out there, and

1134
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:22,401
I just wanted to continue to

1135
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:23,611
fight.

1136
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,613
But it is a life-changing

1137
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,947
experience.

1138
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,074
And it reminds you that life is

1139
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:31,410
good.

1140
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,496
>> Joel.

1141
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:36,248
The big guy.

1142
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,167
>> Truck was pretty intense.

1143
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,460
>> That's exactly the words

1144
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,253
I was going to use.

1145
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:45,341
He was intense.

1146
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:45,966
>> I went in with the goal to

1147
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,760
play the game hard, and I feel

1148
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:48,636
like I did that.

1149
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,013
But my<i> Survivor</i> experience

1150
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,057
should be summed up as failure.

1151
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,475
My goal was to be there at the

1152
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,227
end.

1153
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:56,811
And I didn't reach the goal.

1154
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,479
I failed.

1155
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:02,233
>> Jonathan, Jonathan, Jonathan.

1156
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,818
>> Jonathan is a smooth talker.

1157
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,402
He was tough, though, in this

1158
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:05,653
game, man.

1159
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,363
I give him props.

1160
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,197
>> Yeah, he wouldn't have quit

1161
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,323
for anything.

1162
00:40:09,406 --> 00:40:10,199
>> Nothing.

1163
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,033
>> If he hadn't been taken out

1164
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:11,826
on medical, he never would have

1165
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:12,701
quit.

1166
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,995
>> That's so sad.

1167
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,872
>> Leaving the game for medical

1168
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,041
reasons, I was able to leave

1169
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,501
with my head held high, no

1170
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,628
animosity towards anyone, and

1171
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:25,256
there's nothing that I could

1172
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,757
have done about it.

1173
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:27,967
It is something extremely

1174
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,343
special, and I'll always hold

1175
00:40:29,426 --> 00:40:29,969
this near and dear, and this is

1176
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:33,180
a once-in-a-lifetime experience

1177
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,267
I got to do twice.

1178
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,269
>> Oh, Chet!

1179
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,020
>> My buddy.

1180
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,605
>> You know, I have to say the

1181
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,274
chickens have not been the same

1182
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:44,984
since Chet left.

1183
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:48,320
>> My<i> Survivor</i> experience was

1184
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,114
something I only dreamt of

1185
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,073
happening.

1186
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:51,657
Even though I was told I was

1187
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,659
going out first I went out

1188
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,077
seventh in a beautiful way, as

1189
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:55,703
far as I'm concerned.

1190
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,621
Everybody who was praised for

1191
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,665
their strength, praised for

1192
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:01,709
their agility, praised for their

1193
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,461
athletic ability, I outlasted

1194
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,714
them.

1195
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,340
>> I loved Kathy.

1196
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,925
>> She was...

1197
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,677
>> She was a colorful character.

1198
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,221
>> Yeah, to say the least.

1199
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:18,684
>> I am in awe of every person

1200
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:21,061
who's ever played the game of

1201
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,188
<i>Survivor.</i>

1202
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,772
It's the most difficult thing

1203
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:24,565
I've ever done.

1204
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,734
Childbirth, I thought that was

1205
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:27,735
tough.

1206
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:28,861
Nah.

1207
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,029
I'd rather whip out eight more

1208
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,155
kids in ten minutes than ever do

1209
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:32,114
this again.

1210
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:32,698
That's how much harder

1211
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:35,743
<i>Survivor</i> is.

1212
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,579
>> Oh, Tracy.

1213
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,373
>> She was... you know, I think

1214
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,583
she was underestimated in this

1215
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:43,876
game as a physical competitor.

1216
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:47,129
>> Even if it's 20 days, 20 days

1217
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,547
may seem like not a lot of time

1218
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:49,965
to a lot of people, but when the

1219
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,300
rain is hitting you for nine and

1220
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:51,926
a half hours, you just can't be

1221
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:52,760
that same person any longer

1222
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,970
because you have just you and

1223
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:55,596
the elements.

1224
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,015
I am not the same person any

1225
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,642
longer.

1226
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:00,935
And I don't think I ever want to

1227
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,020
be again.

1228
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,696
>> Ami, Ami, Ami.

1229
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,532
>> You know, I loved Ami.

1230
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:15,866
>> I did, too.

1231
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,869
Ami loved everyone.

1232
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,288
>> This game, I was so much more

1233
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:21,872
sensitive than I was the first

1234
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,582
game.

1235
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,210
I've learned the balance for me

1236
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,212
of vulnerability and strength.

1237
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,381
Of walking into a situation and

1238
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:31,590
being strong with who I am, and

1239
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:32,967
knowing that I don't need the

1240
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,261
feedback of other people to know

1241
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:38,389
I'm okay with who I am.

1242
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:41,684
>> Oh, Eliza.

1243
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:42,601
My arch rival that I had to

1244
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:46,230
compete with for 22 days.

1245
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:47,064
>> Wow.

1246
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:47,898
>> Wow.

1247
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:48,732
>> Eliza put up a good fight in

1248
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:48,983
this game.

1249
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,442
>> Oh, yeah.

1250
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,235
The last tribal council...

1251
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:51,986
>> She went down...

1252
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:52,820
>> She went down swinging.

1253
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:53,696
>> ...in a blaze of glory.

1254
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:54,989
>> Yes, she did.

1255
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,824
>> I was the underdog.

1256
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,827
I was on the outs almost from

1257
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,370
the start, because I didn't

1258
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:02,913
really have an alliance with

1259
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:03,998
anyone.

1260
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,374
And so I knew that I was on the

1261
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,376
bottom, and trying to work every

1262
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:08,002
angle, which is my game, which

1263
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:08,711
is the only game I know how to

1264
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:09,753
play.

1265
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,798
And I think I did a good job.

1266
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:16,051
>> Ozzy!

1267
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,011
>> Ozzy!

1268
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,012
>> Oh, Oz!

1269
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,221
>> I think he's the most well-

1270
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,472
rounded player ever in<i> Survivor.</i>

1271
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:24,018
>> And you like him.

1272
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,769
>> That's why he had to go.

1273
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:26,937
>> You can carry his torch.

1274
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:27,771
I'll let you carry it.

1275
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:30,774
>> To a certain point, your time

1276
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,444
out in<i> Survivor</i> does define you

1277
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,195
to a large degree.

1278
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:35,863
It's like a chance to really

1279
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,490
search your soul and get to know

1280
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:39,658
who you are, and what you're

1281
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:39,867
made of.

1282
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:40,826
I knew that I had to trust

1283
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:42,828
people this time around to make

1284
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:43,662
it anywhere, and that was what

1285
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:46,749
ended up being my downfall.

1286
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:49,585
But my relationship with Amanda

1287
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:50,794
was worth more to me than any

1288
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,756
amount of money.

1289
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,967
>> Good old Jason.

1290
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:57,885
>> He gave Ozzy a ride for his

1291
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,387
money, too.

1292
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,722
>> He beat Ozzy twice.

1293
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:06,435
>> I came out here as a strong

1294
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:09,271
competitor and a good provider,

1295
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,190
and nobody really saw that

1296
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:12,649
because I think everybody was

1297
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,692
just focused on Ozzy.

1298
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:14,818
So it's a bit comforting knowing

1299
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,279
that Ozzy and I both went out in

1300
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,864
the same way.

1301
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:20,074
It shows that I'm just as good

1302
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,159
of a competitor and provider as

1303
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,286
Ozzy.

1304
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,583
>> Oh, James, my little cuddle

1305
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:30,709
bug.

1306
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:31,919
>> He was honest.

1307
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,295
>> Yeah, he was a straight

1308
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,505
shooter.

1309
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:35,547
>> I'd much rather have been

1310
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,049
voted out, because it's like,

1311
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:37,925
closure.

1312
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,843
With a finger injury, it kills

1313
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,554
me.

1314
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:43,847
But the trials I had to go

1315
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:44,932
through with them girls really

1316
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:45,933
was quite a test.

1317
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,267
I mean, I'm not a bully, but I

1318
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,394
surely don't like anybody

1319
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:49,603
telling me what to do.

1320
00:44:49,686 --> 00:44:50,229
So, I mean, I really had to let

1321
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:53,273
go and go within myself to calm

1322
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,526
down.

1323
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,945
>> Alexis.

1324
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:58,737
>> Alexis.

1325
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:01,031
>> You know, if, Alexis made it

1326
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,991
this far, she would definitely

1327
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,201
be hard to beat.

1328
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:05,494
>> Yeah, Alexis was a charmer.

1329
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:09,081
>> Yes, definitely.

1330
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:09,748
>> I felt like I always had this

1331
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:12,251
kind of split between, like, the

1332
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,627
super-competitive tomboy, but

1333
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:14,169
then the super-nice southern

1334
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:15,838
hospitality girl.

1335
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,840
So in a weird way, I feel like I

1336
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,133
came into this game a little

1337
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,343
girl and I got to grow up and

1338
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,804
left a woman.

1339
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,889
>> Poor Erik.

1340
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,474
I'm sorry he had to be the

1341
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:31,270
victim of the women's wrath.

1342
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:32,938
But play with fire, you'll get

1343
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,731
burned.

1344
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:37,443
>> I don't think you can play

1345
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:38,068
this game without changing as a

1346
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,320
person.

1347
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,905
I mean, I've seen so much in so

1348
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,407
few days that I've never, ever

1349
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:43,824
seen in my life.

1350
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,868
I've seen these women here, and

1351
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:46,910
they are vicious.

1352
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,036
I mean, they are cutthroat.

1353
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,538
They are very tough, and there's

1354
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:50,080
a lot of strength in them.

1355
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,999
And it's opened my eyes a little

1356
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,292
bit about the way that women are

1357
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:54,960
and the way that they operate.

1358
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,339
>> Natalie.

1359
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,966
>> Aww.

1360
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,176
The last fan in<i> Survivor.</i>

1361
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,218
>> Good on you, girl.

1362
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,220
>> Good on you, baby.

1363
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,598
>> If the woman has the

1364
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:08,932
opportunity to think, she will

1365
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:09,975
outwit a man.

1366
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:12,269
They may outbrawn a woman, but a

1367
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:15,689
woman will definitely outwit a

1368
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:17,357
man, hands down, every time.

1369
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:18,734
I think I learned a lot about

1370
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:20,402
myself, and right now, I'm kind

1371
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,779
of my biggest fan.

1372
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,195
>> JEFF: Welcome to your final

1373
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,697
immunity challenge.

1374
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,698
You ready to get to it?

1375
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:48,657
>> Yes.

1376
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,616
>> JEFF: All right, Amanda, I'm

1377
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,535
take back the necklace.

1378
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:00,794
For the last time, immunity is

1379
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:02,379
back up for grabs.

1380
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:04,131
For today's immunity challenge,

1381
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:04,965
you each have a long wooden

1382
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:07,259
cylinder that has been cut into

1383
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:08,969
several pieces.

1384
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:09,970
In the center is a slot on which

1385
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,764
rests a metal ball.

1386
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:15,517
On go, you'll pick up the first

1387
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:16,143
piece using two handles,

1388
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,520
balancing the ball.

1389
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:19,104
Every five minutes, as the

1390
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:21,440
challenge continues, you will

1391
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:22,941
add more pieces, making it more

1392
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,819
difficult to hold on to.

1393
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:28,322
If at any point the ball drops,

1394
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,407
you're out of the challenge.

1395
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:30,991
Last person left standing wins

1396
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:35,579
immunity, is guaranteed a spot

1397
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,664
at the final tribal council,

1398
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,082
where you will get a chance to

1399
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,083
convince the jury you're worthy

1400
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,794
of a million dollars.

1401
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,171
Also at tonight's tribal council

1402
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,632
you will, in effect, be deciding

1403
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,634
who you want to sit next to you

1404
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:50,802
at that final tribal.

1405
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:52,095
A very big decision.

1406
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,972
This is potentially a million-

1407
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,224
dollar challenge.

1408
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,768
Shall we get to it?

1409
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:58,810
All right, everybody pick up

1410
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,313
your handles.

1411
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:02,606
Five seconds that I count you

1412
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:04,942
down, that is your grace period.

1413
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,277
Use these five seconds as free

1414
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,737
time to get your bearings.

1415
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,363
When we get to one is when we

1416
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,074
go.

1417
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:14,076
Everybody's picked up their

1418
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,202
handles, got your first piece in

1419
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,203
place.

1420
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:22,250
Five, four, three, two, one.

1421
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:25,212
This challenge is officially on.

1422
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:28,465
We'll go five minutes before we

1423
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:30,926
start adding more pieces, and

1424
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,470
when we do, it will become much

1425
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:35,722
more difficult.

1426
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,147
The slightest lapse in

1427
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,691
concentration, and you will be

1428
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,693
out of this challenge.

1429
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:50,028
You have to constantly check in

1430
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,613
with yourself and make sure you

1431
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:56,660
are staying focused.

1432
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:59,079
All right, this round is over.

1433
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,956
You can set them down.

1434
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,249
You are safe.

1435
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:06,253
All right, let's add two more

1436
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:10,507
pieces, making this cylinder a

1437
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,300
little longer, a little more

1438
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:14,052
difficult to hold.

1439
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,554
Everybody grab your handles.

1440
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,723
Here we go.

1441
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,433
Everybody lift.

1442
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:25,272
Five, four, three, two, one.

1443
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,274
We are on.

1444
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,192
Everybody now holding three

1445
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,945
pieces.

1446
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:33,447
Concentrate.

1447
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,906
All of your energy should be

1448
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,868
focused on keeping that ball

1449
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,244
stable.

1450
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:40,954
You drop this ball, it could

1451
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,331
cost you a million dollars.

1452
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:49,755
One more minute left in this

1453
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:50,756
round.

1454
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:51,715
You can do it.

1455
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:52,924
Hang in there.

1456
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,260
Don't blow it now.

1457
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:58,096
Last 15 seconds in this round.

1458
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:05,479
Five, four, three, two, one.

1459
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:06,897
This round is over.

1460
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:07,814
You're safe.

1461
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,024
Set it down.

1462
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,108
Nice work.

1463
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,902
All right, let's add two more

1464
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:15,405
pieces.

1465
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,782
Now it's going to get

1466
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:17,199
interesting.

1467
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:19,701
Everybody pick up your handles.

1468
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:24,164
Five, four, three, two, one.

1469
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:27,292
This round is on.

1470
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,335
After 38 days of playing this

1471
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:32,047
game together as a team, nowhere

1472
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,757
left to hide.

1473
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,883
Now, instead of working

1474
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:36,009
together, you have to battle

1475
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:38,220
against each other with only one

1476
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:40,847
goal-- beat the other two.

1477
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,982
Parvati drops her ball.

1478
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,192
Parvati is the first person out

1479
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,735
of this challenge.

1480
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,987
Parvati's fate is no longer in

1481
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:59,783
her own hands.

1482
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,243
We are now down to Cirie and

1483
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:03,370
Amanda.

1484
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:07,541
15 seconds left in this round.

1485
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:13,171
Five, four, three, two, one.

1486
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:14,548
This round is over.

1487
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:15,465
Set it down.

1488
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:16,633
You are safe.

1489
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:20,720
>> Oh, my god.

1490
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,180
>> JEFF: All right, next round.

1491
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:25,350
Let's add two more pieces.

1492
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:27,435
Every time you add pieces, it

1493
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,855
gets more difficult.

1494
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:30,397
Let's put your handles up.

1495
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,274
This could be the round that

1496
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:34,609
decides it all.

1497
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:38,613
Here we go.

1498
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:41,116
Five, four, three, two... Cirie

1499
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,993
drops.

1500
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:44,411
If it falls off while I'm still

1501
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,996
counting, we reset.

1502
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,038
Take your time when you're

1503
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:47,914
lifting it up.

1504
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,040
It's not a race.

1505
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:52,627
Here we go, five, four, three,

1506
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:55,380
two, one.

1507
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:57,591
Challenge is back on.

1508
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,384
Amanda going underhand this

1509
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:02,012
time.

1510
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:02,596
Cirie sticking with the same

1511
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,431
grip.

1512
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:05,932
Wherever you're holding it, do

1513
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,225
not move it.

1514
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,810
Hold that ball steady if you

1515
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,228
want a shot at a million bucks.

1516
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:12,147
You have very little wiggle

1517
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,315
room.

1518
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,570
30 more seconds, and you move on

1519
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:20,322
to the last round.

1520
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:26,411
Five, four, three, two, one.

1521
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:28,622
This round is over.

1522
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:29,706
You're safe.

1523
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:30,248
Set it down.

1524
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:35,045
All right.

1525
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,546
Last and final round.

1526
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:41,217
Add the last two pieces.

1527
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,886
Pick up your handles.

1528
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:43,386
This round will go until

1529
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:49,351
somebody drops their ball.

1530
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:50,435
Here we go.

1531
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:56,358
Five, four, three, two, one.

1532
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,859
We are back on.

1533
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:00,111
This is the final round of this

1534
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:02,322
challenge.

1535
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:10,413
Everything you have inside you

1536
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,289
should be focused on keeping

1537
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:14,876
that ball stable.

1538
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,502
The person left standing after

1539
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:19,881
this, immunity.

1540
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,800
Shot at a million bucks.

1541
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:23,093
You lose this challenge, your

1542
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:25,470
fate is not in your hands.

1543
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:36,314
Cirie loses her concentration.

1544
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:38,942
Amanda wins final immunity and

1545
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:41,194
is guaranteed a spot at the

1546
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:43,571
final tribal council.

1547
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:46,700
>> Good job, babies.

1548
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,993
You're awesome.

1549
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,244
>> Thank you.

1550
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:49,995
>> Good job.

1551
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:51,371
You're awesome.

1552
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:54,082
>> I love you guys.

1553
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:56,960
>> JEFF: Amanda, come on over.

1554
00:54:57,043 --> 00:55:00,964
No better time to have this than

1555
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:02,465
right now.

1556
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,134
>> Yep.

1557
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:05,760
>> JEFF: With this, you are

1558
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:06,386
guaranteed a spot at the final

1559
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,512
tribal council.

1560
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,472
You will get a chance to

1561
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:10,390
convince the jury you are worthy

1562
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:11,599
of a million bucks.

1563
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:12,976
At tonight's tribal council, you

1564
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,436
will cast a vote, and in doing

1565
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:15,979
so, you will vote either Parvati

1566
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:17,564
or Cirie out of the game.

1567
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:18,815
The other person you're going to

1568
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:19,941
take with you to the final

1569
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:20,942
tribal.

1570
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,235
Big, big decision.

1571
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:23,361
Have a fun afternoon.

1572
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:24,529
Head back to camp.

1573
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:26,573
I will see you guys at tribal.

1574
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:54,642
>> Oh, Gloria.

1575
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:56,227
>> She likes it here.

1576
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,772
She likes the coop.

1577
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,318
>> Yeah.

1578
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:04,736
We just got back from the last

1579
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,446
immunity challenge, and I won

1580
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,114
immunity.

1581
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:08,698
So I'm going to the final two.

1582
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:11,826
And it's either Parvati or Cirie

1583
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:12,619
going home tonight.

1584
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:15,330
Honestly, this is the hardest

1585
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:15,955
decision I've had to make this

1586
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,791
whole game, because, you know,

1587
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:18,541
we're each close.

1588
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,460
All of us are close.

1589
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,337
So who do you send home?

1590
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,838
>> I don't know what happened.

1591
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:26,257
I must have blinked.

1592
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:26,674
>> And it just fell?

1593
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:32,972
>> Mm-hmm.

1594
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,349
>> She's a closer, that one, you

1595
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:35,600
know?

1596
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,560
>> I thought for sure that I

1597
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,521
could win this one.

1598
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:42,732
Because during surgeries, you

1599
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:45,235
have to hold, like, retractors

1600
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:47,403
or instrumentation, and you

1601
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:48,822
can't really move.

1602
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,281
If you move, somebody might get

1603
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:51,491
hurt.

1604
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,910
Unfortunately, Amanda won.

1605
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:55,411
And since Parv and Amanda are so

1606
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:56,955
buddy-buddy, unless something

1607
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,498
happens, I'm probably going home

1608
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,708
tonight.

1609
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,011
>> This is my decision, pretty

1610
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:12,804
much.

1611
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:14,055
>> I know.

1612
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,014
We're not even voting, I don't

1613
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:15,807
think.

1614
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:16,641
>> No, I am.

1615
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:16,808
Me.

1616
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:17,517
>> Yeah.

1617
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,394
>> That sucks.

1618
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:19,686
>> I know.

1619
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:26,526
I mean, she understands.

1620
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:27,986
My fate is pretty much in

1621
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:28,570
Amanda's hands right now.

1622
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,905
But I'm fairly confident that

1623
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,574
she's going to take me to the

1624
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:33,825
final two with her.

1625
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,201
We've had an alliance since day

1626
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,536
one out here.

1627
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:37,495
And we also have a really tight

1628
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,663
relationship, Amanda and I,

1629
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:40,498
that's developed over the course

1630
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:41,666
of this game.

1631
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:43,126
So I'm not worried about it,

1632
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:43,585
really.

1633
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:44,627
This is good, because then

1634
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:45,587
tomorrow we can just help each

1635
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,505
other with our opening speeches,

1636
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:48,047
just question each other and

1637
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:48,673
hang out.

1638
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:52,135
Oh, today was awful, though.

1639
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:57,098
>> Well, you've been handling

1640
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:57,724
all these situations really

1641
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,601
gracefully, you know.

1642
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:01,519
>> Well, I already knew, like,

1643
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,229
if I didn't win that she'd take

1644
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,857
you, so it's not like...

1645
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,151
>> She pissed way more people

1646
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:08,526
off than I did.

1647
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,528
>> Yeah, actually, huh?

1648
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:12,780
>> Yeah.

1649
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:25,835
>> This is such a nightmare that

1650
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,086
this happened today.

1651
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,589
I can't even believe that... how

1652
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:30,715
do I make the decision?

1653
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:33,092
What do I go by?

1654
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,469
>> I don't know.

1655
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:35,970
>> It's, like, the hardest thing

1656
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,555
I've ever had to do.

1657
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:39,224
>> Yeah.

1658
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:40,266
>> Parvati and Cirie both

1659
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,517
deserve to be here.

1660
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:42,060
They both want to be here.

1661
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:44,187
So I honestly don't know what to

1662
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:44,562
do.

1663
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,689
I have a really good personal

1664
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,691
relationship with Parvati, so I

1665
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:49,776
feel more loyal to Parvati.

1666
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:53,238
>> I feel like your best shot

1667
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,656
with the jury is taking me over

1668
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:57,075
Parv.

1669
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:57,700
Every person she screwed over, I

1670
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:58,618
screwed over.

1671
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:01,120
We did everything together.

1672
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,248
Every blindside we orchestrated

1673
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:04,791
together.

1674
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,209
Most of them I did most of the

1675
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:09,921
talking for.

1676
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:12,757
>> So how is...

1677
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:18,054
>> Yeah, but that's only if the

1678
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,639
people are willing to listen.

1679
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:20,765
These are the people I screwed

1680
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:22,684
over I would have to talk to.

1681
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:25,311
>> Cirie has pissed a lot of

1682
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,771
people off on the jury.

1683
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:28,898
Probably more than Parvati.

1684
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:30,817
But Cirie is a hell of a

1685
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:31,901
speaker.

1686
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,653
She can convince anyone to do

1687
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,113
anything.

1688
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:36,572
And in the final tribal council,

1689
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:37,865
she could convince the jury to

1690
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,117
give her the million dollars.

1691
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,785
So, I mean, it's kind of a

1692
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:42,578
catch-22.

1693
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:45,373
>> It should be interesting.

1694
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:50,962
>> Making this decision tonight

1695
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:52,005
is killing me.

1696
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:53,172
You kind of have to just go with

1697
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,590
how you feel, and a gut feeling.

1698
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:55,633
And I've been going with my gut

1699
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:56,801
this whole game, and it's gotten

1700
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:58,136
me this far, but I know that

1701
00:59:58,219 --> 00:59:59,387
this decision could cost me the

1702
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:00,805
million dollars.

1703
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:20,742
>> JEFF: We'll now bring in the

1704
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:24,454
members of our jury.

1705
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:28,207
Eliza, Ozzy, Jason, James,

1706
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:32,253
Alexis, Erik, and Natalie, voted

1707
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:36,007
out at the last tribal council.

1708
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:38,676
Well, after 38 days, we've

1709
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,678
reached a point where there is

1710
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,305
only one decision left to be

1711
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:44,474
made before we turn this game

1712
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:46,476
over to the jury.

1713
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:47,769
And that is, who's going to that

1714
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:49,270
final tribal council?

1715
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:49,896
Amanda, after winning today's

1716
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:52,607
immunity challenge, you are in

1717
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:53,900
total control.

1718
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:55,151
>> I know.

1719
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:56,486
>> JEFF: Tough decision, in a

1720
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:57,487
way.

1721
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:58,654
You guys have been together

1722
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:00,114
almost from the beginning.

1723
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,324
>> Yeah.

1724
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:01,908
I mean, winning immunity today

1725
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:04,369
was a blessing and a curse at

1726
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:06,079
the same time.

1727
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,663
You know, it's a blessing

1728
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:08,915
because I'm guaranteed the final

1729
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:11,542
two, and it's a curse because I

1730
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:12,710
have to choose who goes with me.

1731
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:16,714
And we're so close, it's...

1732
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:21,302
It's just a hard, hard decision.

1733
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:23,137
>> JEFF: Cirie, do you buy that

1734
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:25,139
it's difficult for Amanda?

1735
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:25,932
>> Yeah.

1736
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,725
I believe it's difficult for

1737
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:30,103
Amanda, because we have been

1738
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,105
together since day one.

1739
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,439
Amanda, Parvati, and myself, we

1740
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,316
kind of decided, you know, it

1741
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,026
should be us three 'til the end.

1742
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,404
And it pretty much has been

1743
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:40,822
that.

1744
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:42,323
>> JEFF: Parvati, difficult to

1745
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:44,409
not have any say at this point?

1746
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:45,827
>> I honestly don't envy

1747
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:48,579
Amanda's position at all right

1748
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:49,747
now.

1749
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:51,040
I mean, she has a hard decision

1750
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:52,083
to make.

1751
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:53,835
We have all been protecting each

1752
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:55,169
other through blindside after

1753
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:56,462
blindside, weathering storms

1754
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,423
together, and I don't think it

1755
01:01:58,506 --> 01:01:59,048
is going to be an easy decision,

1756
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,883
and I wouldn't want to be making

1757
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:02,051
it.

1758
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,094
>> JEFF: So Amanda, take me

1759
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:04,512
through both sides of this.

1760
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:06,305
What about bringing Parvati or

1761
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,724
Cirie to the end is risky?

1762
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:10,810
>> You know, with these girls

1763
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,687
it's a tossup at this point.

1764
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:13,896
Strategy-wise, Cirie is a great

1765
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,274
talker.

1766
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:16,816
She can convince pretty much

1767
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:19,569
anyone to do anything.

1768
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:21,612
And, you know, that's a threat

1769
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:22,780
at the end of the game.

1770
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:25,283
And Parvati has played a very

1771
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:26,951
social game.

1772
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:28,119
She has made personal

1773
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:29,620
relationships on the jury that I

1774
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:30,246
think will definitely come into

1775
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:32,165
play at the final tribal

1776
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:32,874
council.

1777
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:35,209
So it was a hard decision, but I

1778
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:36,961
ultimately made a decision on my

1779
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:37,837
gut feeling.

1780
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,506
>> JEFF: Take me through the

1781
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:41,883
mixed emotions that have to be

1782
01:02:41,966 --> 01:02:43,759
going through your head-- the

1783
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,887
joy of knowing "I succeeded,

1784
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:48,473
I am going to be at the final

1785
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:50,141
tribal after 39 days of

1786
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:51,976
working," and the pain of having

1787
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:53,811
to vote somebody out that you've

1788
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,897
been with from the beginning.

1789
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,274
>> Yeah.

1790
01:02:58,357 --> 01:02:59,817
>> That's okay.

1791
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:04,030
>> It's just really hard for me,

1792
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:07,158
because I feel like either way,

1793
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:09,160
it's a lose-lose situation for

1794
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:10,369
me at this point.

1795
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:11,662
I mean, if I go with Cirie, I'm

1796
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:12,872
hurts Parvati.

1797
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:13,873
If I go with Parvati, I'm

1798
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:15,124
hurting Cirie.

1799
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:17,001
I know that this vote tonight is

1800
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:18,085
going to hurt someone's

1801
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:19,212
feelings.

1802
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,922
And I'm just having a hard time

1803
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:23,508
with that.

1804
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:26,260
>> JEFF: All right, let's get to

1805
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:26,928
the vote.

1806
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:28,971
Amanda, since you have immunity,

1807
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:31,015
nobody can vote for you.

1808
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:32,600
That means Cirie can only vote

1809
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:34,268
for Parvati.

1810
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:36,812
Parvati can only vote for Cirie.

1811
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:37,980
Parvati and Cirie, you won't

1812
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:39,065
vote tonight.

1813
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:40,483
The only person voting tonight

1814
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:41,526
is Amanda.

1815
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:42,443
You'll be voting out the 15th

1816
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:43,653
person from this game, and you

1817
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:44,237
will be deciding who you are

1818
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,364
bringing with you to the final

1819
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:47,490
tribal council.

1820
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:48,824
If you're wrong, it is a

1821
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,159
million-dollar mistake.

1822
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:51,369
If you're right, this time

1823
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:52,787
tomorrow night, you're a

1824
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:53,079
millionaire.

1825
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:54,080
>> I know.

1826
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:56,249
>> JEFF: It's time to vote.

1827
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:58,584
Amanda, you're up.

1828
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:35,371
I'll go get the vote.

1829
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:45,423
Once the votes are read, the

1830
01:04:45,506 --> 01:04:46,048
decision is final.

1831
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:47,091
The person voted out will be

1832
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:48,092
asked to leave the tribal

1833
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:49,969
council area immediately.

1834
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:52,305
I'll read the vote.

1835
01:04:58,436 --> 01:04:59,061
15th person voted out, and the

1836
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:01,814
eighth and final member of our

1837
01:05:01,897 --> 01:05:04,275
jury, Cirie.

1838
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:06,902
You need to bring me your torch.

1839
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:07,236
>> I'm sorry.

1840
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,112
>> It's okay.

1841
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:11,490
It's all right.

1842
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:25,046
Cirie, the tribe has spoken.

1843
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:28,633
Time for you to go.

1844
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:43,648
>> JEFF: Parvati, Amanda, you

1845
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:45,524
have gone as far as you can go

1846
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:46,817
in this game.

1847
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,569
The power now shifts to the

1848
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:50,613
jury.

1849
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:52,448
Eight people-- including Cirie--

1850
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:53,032
that you had a hand in voting

1851
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:55,576
out now hold your fate in their

1852
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,662
hands.

1853
01:05:57,745 --> 01:05:59,288
You've got one more night.

1854
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:00,748
I hope you can enjoy it.

1855
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,874
I'll see you both tomorrow night

1856
01:06:01,957 --> 01:06:03,501
for your final tribal council.

1857
01:06:03,584 --> 01:06:04,585
Grab your torches, head back to

1858
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:05,586
camp.

1859
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,088
Good night.

1860
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:15,137
>> Here I am again, coming up

1861
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,097
just short.

1862
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:20,059
HB, John, Jamil, Jared, Mom,

1863
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,395
Dad, sorry.

1864
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,063
I tried my hardest.

1865
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:27,858
It just wasn't meant to be.

1866
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:02,143
>> We're going home tonight.

1867
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:04,353
>> I was so happy when I woke up

1868
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:05,938
today.

1869
01:07:06,021 --> 01:07:07,356
To finally know that I made it

1870
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,107
to the end, you know, I just

1871
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:10,192
kind of, like, breathed and...

1872
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:14,321
I can't believe we did this.

1873
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:15,239
>> I can't believe we're the

1874
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:16,240
last two.

1875
01:07:16,323 --> 01:07:17,199
>> I know.

1876
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:18,993
Everyone's gone but me and you.

1877
01:07:19,076 --> 01:07:19,285
>> I know.

1878
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:20,161
>> We bamboozled everyone out of

1879
01:07:20,244 --> 01:07:22,288
the game.

1880
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:24,540
>> This morning when I woke up,

1881
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:26,000
I think the happiness, like,

1882
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:27,042
started in my stomach, and it

1883
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:28,294
bubbled up, and I couldn't wipe

1884
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:29,545
the smile off my face.

1885
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:30,921
All the hard work has paid off.

1886
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:32,631
We're here, and it's done, and

1887
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:34,717
we're final two.

1888
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,516
>> Oh, my god!

1889
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,059
>> BOTH: Oh...

1890
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:44,268
my...

1891
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:46,562
God.

1892
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:47,688
>> Amanda and I pretty much own

1893
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:48,773
this game.

1894
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:49,815
She made it all the way to the

1895
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,025
end in China.

1896
01:07:51,108 --> 01:07:52,276
I made it almost all the way to

1897
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:54,695
the end in the Cooks.

1898
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:56,030
To be in the final two in this

1899
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:56,489
season, it's a serious

1900
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,866
accomplishment, and I feel like

1901
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:00,493
I can stand up tall and be like,

1902
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:01,702
"I am a survivor."

1903
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:03,579
Oh, my god.

1904
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:05,206
I am so glad I'm with you.

1905
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:06,373
>> I know, me, too!

1906
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:07,875
There's no other person here I'd

1907
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:08,501
rather be here with right now.

1908
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:10,544
>> Me, either.

1909
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:11,879
This is, like, the prettiest

1910
01:08:11,962 --> 01:08:13,047
picnic ever.

1911
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:13,547
>> This is, like, a huge

1912
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:14,173
accomplishment.

1913
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,175
Like, this is the biggest

1914
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:17,176
accomplishment of my life.

1915
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,219
>> Mine, too.

1916
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:19,428
>> I feel like we battled every

1917
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:20,763
element to get where we are

1918
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:21,388
right now-- like, every possible

1919
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:24,141
thing that we could go through,

1920
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:26,143
we've gone through, and we've,

1921
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:28,020
like, mastered it, and we've

1922
01:08:28,103 --> 01:08:29,605
gotten ourselves here.

1923
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:30,314
In the past six months, I've

1924
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:32,942
been living in the jungle for 78

1925
01:08:33,025 --> 01:08:35,236
days, you know, so I don't think

1926
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:37,238
there's much in real life that I

1927
01:08:37,321 --> 01:08:38,531
can't handle after

1928
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:39,824
two<i> Survivors</i> in a row.

1929
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:41,200
>> We're going to be so good

1930
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:42,451
tonight at that tribal thing.

1931
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:43,494
>> Oh, yeah, we're going to be,

1932
01:08:43,577 --> 01:08:44,954
like, happy and full and be

1933
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:45,996
like, "Yeah, ask us your

1934
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,832
questions.

1935
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:49,291
Bring it on."

1936
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,460
>> "Bring it on, bitches."

1937
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:52,878
>> I think it's interesting that

1938
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,088
me and Parvati are in the end of

1939
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:54,713
this game together, because we

1940
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,257
have played completely different

1941
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:57,424
games.

1942
01:08:57,508 --> 01:08:58,926
I think I have played this game

1943
01:08:59,009 --> 01:08:59,468
loyal to my alliances, and

1944
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:01,554
Parvati pretty much did anything

1945
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:03,097
she needed to do to take

1946
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:05,683
control.

1947
01:09:05,766 --> 01:09:07,268
And because of that, a lot of

1948
01:09:07,351 --> 01:09:08,435
people on the jury don't like

1949
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:09,270
her, so that could be a benefit

1950
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:11,772
for me.

1951
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:12,398
>> We have had this game in the

1952
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:15,651
palm of our hands since we met.

1953
01:09:15,734 --> 01:09:16,235
And then the switch-up.

1954
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:18,571
And then the craziness.

1955
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:20,656
And then, still, it's still you

1956
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:23,784
and me.

1957
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:24,410
I really, honestly, feel so

1958
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:26,203
relaxed going into the final

1959
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:31,959
tribal council.

1960
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:32,585
I feel like I've played a game

1961
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,503
that's been very true to myself.

1962
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:35,629
I don't feel like I could have

1963
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:36,213
played this game better.

1964
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:38,549
>> You want to do the honors?

1965
01:09:38,632 --> 01:09:42,553
>> Sure.

1966
01:09:42,636 --> 01:09:48,434
>> Ah-hah!

1967
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:50,019
My game was a lot more

1968
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:51,103
aggressive than Amanda's game.

1969
01:09:51,186 --> 01:09:51,687
It was a lot more cutthroat,

1970
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:53,772
more cold-blooded.

1971
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:58,277
I was playing this to win.

1972
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,362
>> We're pyromaniacs.

1973
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:02,740
>> That's awesome.

1974
01:10:02,823 --> 01:10:03,365
I think my strongest point I can

1975
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:06,076
make tonight is standing up and

1976
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,786
owning that I have been a

1977
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:08,329
powerful, controlling player

1978
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:10,289
throughout the duration of this

1979
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:25,804
game.

1980
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:26,305
>> Parvati has played a

1981
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:29,099
cutthroat, aggressive game, and

1982
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:29,642
I know that she's going to

1983
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:31,977
finish with a cutthroat,

1984
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:33,145
aggressive game, and that could

1985
01:10:33,228 --> 01:10:34,563
be by her throwing me under the

1986
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,023
bus tonight at tribal.

1987
01:10:36,106 --> 01:10:37,524
And if that is the case, then I

1988
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:40,736
am ready to fight for this.

1989
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:46,367
I think people will give me

1990
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:48,410
their votes, because I was loyal

1991
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:49,495
to every alliance that I've

1992
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:50,621
made.

1993
01:10:50,704 --> 01:10:51,872
Yeah, the jury makes the

1994
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:53,082
decision, but ultimately, it's

1995
01:10:53,165 --> 01:10:53,666
me and Parvati convincing the

1996
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:56,460
jury what to do.

1997
01:10:56,543 --> 01:10:57,753
Tonight we're going toe to toe,

1998
01:10:57,836 --> 01:10:58,671
and one person is going to win a

1999
01:10:58,754 --> 01:10:59,630
million dollars, and the other

2000
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:00,464
person is going to walk away

2001
01:11:00,547 --> 01:11:01,340
with nothing, and may the best

2002
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:04,009
woman win.

2003
01:11:22,569 --> 01:11:24,697
>> JEFF: We'll now bring in the

2004
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:27,366
members of our jury.

2005
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:32,329
Eliza, Ozzy, Jason, James,

2006
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:37,042
Alexis, Erik, Natalie, and

2007
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:38,419
Cirie, voted out at the last

2008
01:11:38,502 --> 01:11:40,963
tribal council.

2009
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:41,547
Welcome to your final tribal

2010
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,340
council.

2011
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:46,760
Congratulations on outlasting 18

2012
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:49,638
other people in this game.

2013
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,557
Tonight, the power shifts from

2014
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,976
this side of the tribal council

2015
01:11:54,059 --> 01:11:55,894
over to the jury.

2016
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,438
Based on what they've seen over

2017
01:11:57,521 --> 01:11:59,440
the last 39 days and what they

2018
01:11:59,523 --> 01:12:01,734
hear tonight, the jury will make

2019
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:03,402
a million-dollar decision.

2020
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:05,904
Here's how it's going to work.

2021
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:07,322
You will each get a chance to

2022
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:07,865
make an opening statement.

2023
01:12:07,948 --> 01:12:09,575
This is your first chance to

2024
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:10,909
convince this jury why you are

2025
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:11,493
deserving of the title of sole

2026
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:13,829
survivor.

2027
01:12:13,912 --> 01:12:14,538
The jury will then get their

2028
01:12:14,621 --> 01:12:20,377
first chance to address you.

2029
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:21,378
We will then vote.

2030
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:24,590
Opening statements.

2031
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:27,342
Amanda, you're up.

2032
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:31,221
>> I came into this game, you

2033
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:32,389
know, wanting to do two things.

2034
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:34,224
I wanted to play a loyal game,

2035
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:35,726
and I wanted to fight

2036
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:37,102
physically, strategically, and

2037
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:38,437
mentally to the end.

2038
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,521
And, you know, I'm really proud

2039
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:41,732
of how I played.

2040
01:12:41,815 --> 01:12:43,150
And I know I wouldn't be sitting

2041
01:12:43,233 --> 01:12:44,693
here without, you know, help

2042
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:46,445
from all of you.

2043
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:48,238
So thanks.

2044
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:49,990
I wanted to say thanks.

2045
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:53,285
>> JEFF: Parvati.

2046
01:12:53,368 --> 01:12:56,622
>> I came into this game with a

2047
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:58,373
previous reputation from the

2048
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:00,918
Cook Islands as the flirt.

2049
01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:03,295
I knew that I had to play so

2050
01:13:03,378 --> 01:13:03,921
much differently than I played

2051
01:13:04,004 --> 01:13:04,588
in the Cook Islands.

2052
01:13:04,671 --> 01:13:05,547
Like, I had to play

2053
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:07,508
aggressively.

2054
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:08,801
I had to beat my competition

2055
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,177
before my competition had a

2056
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:11,762
chance to beat me.

2057
01:13:11,845 --> 01:13:13,222
And you gave me a serious run

2058
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:17,226
for my money, all of you.

2059
01:13:17,309 --> 01:13:21,105
So the only thing I could do was

2060
01:13:21,188 --> 01:13:23,357
make bold power plays, and with

2061
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,192
the help of a powerful group of

2062
01:13:25,275 --> 01:13:26,568
women, pull off some of the

2063
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:28,695
hugest heists in<i> Survivor</i>

2064
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:30,155
history.

2065
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,908
So ask me anything you want, and

2066
01:13:32,991 --> 01:13:34,076
you'll get an honest answer.

2067
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:35,327
>> JEFF: All right, jury, in a

2068
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:35,994
moment you're going to get your

2069
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,496
first chance to address Amanda

2070
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:38,664
and Parvati.

2071
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:39,832
I'll give you a moment to think

2072
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:42,042
about what you want to say.

2073
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:03,772
>> JEFF: All right, jury, it is

2074
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,691
now your first opportunity to

2075
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:08,610
address Amanda and Parvati,

2076
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:09,862
trying to gain the information

2077
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:10,904
you need to make a million-

2078
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:11,822
dollar decision.

2079
01:14:11,905 --> 01:14:14,408
Eliza, get us started.

2080
01:14:19,746 --> 01:14:20,789
>> Both of you played a great

2081
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:21,707
strategic game.

2082
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:22,666
You made moves, and I can

2083
01:14:22,749 --> 01:14:24,251
respect that.

2084
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:24,877
But I honestly have no idea who

2085
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,503
I'm going to vote for tonight.

2086
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:31,008
Parvati, all 24 days I spent in

2087
01:14:31,091 --> 01:14:31,675
this game I spent on the island

2088
01:14:31,758 --> 01:14:34,011
with you.

2089
01:14:34,094 --> 01:14:34,595
I think taking out Ozzy was a

2090
01:14:34,678 --> 01:14:38,015
brilliant strategic move.

2091
01:14:38,098 --> 01:14:39,433
I respect that move that you

2092
01:14:39,516 --> 01:14:41,143
made.

2093
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:43,103
What I can't respect, however,

2094
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:43,729
is everything you did that was

2095
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:45,522
not necessary for strategic

2096
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:47,816
advancement in this game.

2097
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:48,901
You talked about me behind my

2098
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:49,860
back.

2099
01:14:49,943 --> 01:14:50,944
You made fun of me.

2100
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:52,112
And that is not what got you to

2101
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:53,405
the final two.

2102
01:14:53,488 --> 01:14:54,031
It leads me to believe that you

2103
01:14:54,114 --> 01:14:55,574
might just be a mean person.

2104
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:56,742
So I'm going to have a lot of

2105
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:57,743
difficulty giving you my vote

2106
01:14:57,826 --> 01:14:58,994
tonight.

2107
01:14:59,077 --> 01:15:00,537
Amanda, you played a great

2108
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:03,207
strategic game, and it was very

2109
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:04,500
impressive.

2110
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:06,251
However, listening to you talk

2111
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,253
literally made me want to kill

2112
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:08,754
myself sometimes.

2113
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:10,839
I don't know that I can vote for

2114
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:12,341
someone who I think is so

2115
01:15:12,424 --> 01:15:13,926
superficial.

2116
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:15,177
And I'm going to be sitting

2117
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:15,802
right there tonight listening to

2118
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:17,804
every single thing you both say,

2119
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:19,556
because my vote is absolutely

2120
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:20,641
not determined.

2121
01:15:20,724 --> 01:15:21,892
So I hope that I can see some

2122
01:15:21,975 --> 01:15:23,227
genuineness and honesty from you

2123
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:24,770
two tonight.

2124
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:26,521
>> JEFF: Thanks, Eliza.

2125
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:29,733
Jason, you're up.

2126
01:15:34,446 --> 01:15:35,781
>> Amanda, when Ozzy was voted

2127
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:37,699
out, if you were let in on that

2128
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:41,828
plan, would you have told Ozzy?

2129
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:43,747
>> Yes.

2130
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:48,585
>> And Parv, I've had these

2131
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:49,586
misconceptions of you as a

2132
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:52,339
devious, manipulative player.

2133
01:15:52,422 --> 01:15:52,923
And I just want to know what

2134
01:15:53,006 --> 01:15:55,342
some of your redeeming qualities

2135
01:15:55,425 --> 01:15:56,802
have been in the game.

2136
01:15:56,885 --> 01:15:59,263
>> Okay.

2137
01:15:59,346 --> 01:16:01,807
Well, I think for one, I was

2138
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,684
very protective of my alliance

2139
01:16:03,767 --> 01:16:07,354
with Cirie and Amanda, gave them

2140
01:16:07,437 --> 01:16:09,147
my loyalty, and was loyal to

2141
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:10,691
them all the way to the end.

2142
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:14,653
So protectiveness and loyalty to

2143
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:15,779
the ladies that I gave my

2144
01:16:15,862 --> 01:16:17,990
loyalty to.

2145
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:20,367
We didn't kill Gloria the

2146
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:21,827
chicken.

2147
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:23,078
We saved her life.

2148
01:16:23,161 --> 01:16:24,288
So I'm an animal lover.

2149
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:25,747
Is that good enough?

2150
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:26,915
>> Okay.

2151
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:27,749
>> JEFF: Satisfied?

2152
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:28,667
>> Yeah.

2153
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:29,876
Good luck to the both of you.

2154
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:34,756
>> JEFF: Alexis, you're up.

2155
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,717
>> My first question is for

2156
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:37,676
Parv.

2157
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,053
And, obviously, one of the

2158
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:41,179
biggest, most important things

2159
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:41,847
to me is how passionate I am

2160
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:44,099
about working with young girls.

2161
01:16:44,182 --> 01:16:46,435
I guess I'm just really curious

2162
01:16:46,518 --> 01:16:48,186
what makes you a better role

2163
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:48,854
model than Amanda for young

2164
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:51,481
girls.

2165
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:52,065
>> I don't know if it's better

2166
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:52,733
or worse.

2167
01:16:52,816 --> 01:16:54,901
I'm more outspoken than Amanda.

2168
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:56,612
So I think I'm more independent.

2169
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:57,779
I don't like things to be done

2170
01:16:57,863 --> 01:16:59,031
for me.

2171
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:00,615
Amanda would go along with the

2172
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:02,576
flow, and for me, I think I'm

2173
01:17:02,659 --> 01:17:04,244
more willing to put myself out

2174
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:06,872
there and make bold moves.

2175
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:08,415
And I didn't see much of that

2176
01:17:08,498 --> 01:17:09,666
from Amanda.

2177
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:10,751
So I guess that's why I feel

2178
01:17:10,834 --> 01:17:11,877
like I would make a better role

2179
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,795
model.

2180
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:15,047
>> Thank you.

2181
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:15,756
Amanda, I have seen a bunch of

2182
01:17:15,839 --> 01:17:19,760
Oscar award-winning performances

2183
01:17:19,843 --> 01:17:22,471
and we couldn't help but be

2184
01:17:22,554 --> 01:17:24,264
laughing when you were crying

2185
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:25,766
about sending Cirie home.

2186
01:17:25,849 --> 01:17:27,017
It's not that I'm not

2187
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:27,809
sympathetic to it.

2188
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:28,435
It's just I think, you know, you

2189
01:17:28,518 --> 01:17:29,686
cry wolf so many times that,

2190
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:32,397
like, what about, if any, part

2191
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,191
of your game has been genuine?

2192
01:17:34,274 --> 01:17:35,359
>> I haven't been faking

2193
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:36,443
anything that I've done at

2194
01:17:36,526 --> 01:17:37,527
tribal.

2195
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:38,779
The tears... like, I've only

2196
01:17:38,862 --> 01:17:40,364
cried the last tribal council,

2197
01:17:40,447 --> 01:17:40,822
and that was genuine.

2198
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,949
Like, that was the hardest

2199
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:44,368
decision I've ever had to make.

2200
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:45,744
I didn't come here trying to get

2201
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:46,870
sympathy votes.

2202
01:17:46,953 --> 01:17:47,996
I don't want sympathy votes.

2203
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,706
>> JEFF: Do you have what you

2204
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:50,749
need?

2205
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:51,708
>> Mm-hmm.

2206
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:53,085
>> JEFF: Okay.

2207
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:59,633
Natalie, you're up.

2208
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:03,679
>> Ladies.

2209
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:04,221
First of all, you have my

2210
01:18:04,304 --> 01:18:08,475
respect tonight, woman to woman.

2211
01:18:08,558 --> 01:18:09,893
I'll start with you, Parv.

2212
01:18:09,976 --> 01:18:11,311
You have labeled yourself as a

2213
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:13,188
flirt.

2214
01:18:13,271 --> 01:18:15,357
You're probably the most

2215
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:15,982
masterful person in the history

2216
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:18,026
of<i> Survivor</i> to play the flirt

2217
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:19,236
card, which is great.

2218
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:20,737
My question to you is how does

2219
01:18:20,821 --> 01:18:23,740
that resonate for you in the

2220
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:25,117
bedroom?

2221
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,577
How do you take that to the next

2222
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:28,203
level as far as strategy in the

2223
01:18:28,286 --> 01:18:30,414
game?

2224
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:31,748
How does that translate your

2225
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:34,751
layers of being?

2226
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:35,752
>> JEFF: Come on, guys.

2227
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:37,712
Parvati, do you know what she's

2228
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:40,090
asking?

2229
01:18:40,173 --> 01:18:41,341
>> You're a flirt.

2230
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:42,426
You flirted with me on several

2231
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:42,759
occasions.

2232
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:43,969
I'm not complaining.

2233
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:45,762
>> You're sexy.

2234
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:47,055
>> Thanks.

2235
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:49,516
So how does being the flirt

2236
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:51,852
parallel to your intimate life?

2237
01:18:51,935 --> 01:18:55,230
>> I think my strategy in this

2238
01:18:55,313 --> 01:18:57,274
game has been infused with my

2239
01:18:57,357 --> 01:18:59,443
personality, and being

2240
01:18:59,526 --> 01:19:00,068
flirtatious is a big part of my

2241
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:02,028
personality.

2242
01:19:02,112 --> 01:19:07,701
At home, it gets me what I want.

2243
01:19:07,784 --> 01:19:09,786
I'll flirt with girls to get my

2244
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:11,371
way, or I'll flirt with guys to

2245
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:12,664
get my way.

2246
01:19:12,747 --> 01:19:15,000
And I think I honestly can

2247
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:16,251
develop genuine relationships

2248
01:19:16,334 --> 01:19:17,419
with people without flirting

2249
01:19:17,502 --> 01:19:18,587
with them.

2250
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:19,171
But it is an old standby, I'm

2251
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:21,089
not going to lie.

2252
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:22,507
>> Okay.

2253
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,634
Amanda, clearly, you're a

2254
01:19:24,718 --> 01:19:25,010
beautiful woman.

2255
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:27,637
You appear to be a very strong

2256
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:30,015
woman.

2257
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:31,766
Unfortunately, you always had,

2258
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:32,392
like, a glazed-over look on your

2259
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:34,019
face.

2260
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:35,312
I did notice that.

2261
01:19:35,395 --> 01:19:36,021
My question to you is was that

2262
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:38,356
your strategy to kind of play

2263
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,942
the zombied pretty girl, not

2264
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:42,986
really knowing what's going on,

2265
01:19:43,069 --> 01:19:46,698
pageant queen cliche, or is this

2266
01:19:46,781 --> 01:19:49,659
who you are as a person?

2267
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:50,994
>> No, it's neither.

2268
01:19:51,077 --> 01:19:52,245
It was neither my strategy, nor

2269
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:52,996
do I think that's who I am as a

2270
01:19:53,079 --> 01:19:55,165
person.

2271
01:19:55,248 --> 01:19:56,583
I'm a strong woman.

2272
01:19:56,666 --> 01:19:57,876
I definitely have substance.

2273
01:19:57,959 --> 01:19:59,503
Sometimes I'm a little reserved,

2274
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:00,921
but I definitely think I've made

2275
01:20:01,004 --> 01:20:02,297
intellectual strategic

2276
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:03,548
decisions.

2277
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:04,216
And, you know, I want to compete

2278
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:06,051
with the men.

2279
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:07,219
Like, I came in this game to

2280
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:08,386
compete with the guys.

2281
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:09,471
And I don't want anything given

2282
01:20:09,554 --> 01:20:10,430
to me.

2283
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:11,306
I came in here to earn

2284
01:20:11,389 --> 01:20:12,265
everything.

2285
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:13,141
>> Okay, thank you both for your

2286
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:13,975
answers.

2287
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:15,185
>> JEFF: Thanks, Natalie.

2288
01:20:15,268 --> 01:20:17,813
Erik, you're up.

2289
01:20:24,027 --> 01:20:26,321
>> Hi, girls.

2290
01:20:26,404 --> 01:20:28,365
Let me just start by saying five

2291
01:20:28,448 --> 01:20:28,949
to six days ago, I would have

2292
01:20:29,032 --> 01:20:31,743
been 100% voting for Amanda in

2293
01:20:31,826 --> 01:20:32,077
this situation.

2294
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,870
I mean, I really respected you,

2295
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:36,456
Amanda.

2296
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:37,541
And I really thought of you kind

2297
01:20:37,624 --> 01:20:40,544
of as a big sister, or a cousin.

2298
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:41,169
As of late, after seeing certain

2299
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:43,421
things, I mean, I'm looking at

2300
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,090
you right now with a lot of

2301
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:46,800
questions.

2302
01:20:46,883 --> 01:20:48,051
I felt totally burned, totally

2303
01:20:48,134 --> 01:20:50,387
thrown under the bus at the past

2304
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:51,763
two tribal councils that I was

2305
01:20:51,846 --> 01:20:53,223
there.

2306
01:20:53,306 --> 01:20:55,267
You pretty much ripped me apart.

2307
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:56,017
I mean, on what basis did you

2308
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:58,103
have to just judge me in front

2309
01:20:58,186 --> 01:20:58,979
of everybody, in front of this

2310
01:20:59,062 --> 01:20:59,187
jury?

2311
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:00,772
>> Okay.

2312
01:21:00,855 --> 01:21:01,565
>> I just want to know that.

2313
01:21:01,648 --> 01:21:02,566
I really want to know that.

2314
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:03,149
>> You know, everything I said

2315
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:04,025
in tribal council was honest.

2316
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:06,069
You were unloyal to me, and you

2317
01:21:06,152 --> 01:21:07,237
tried to get me voted out, and I

2318
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:08,363
was hurt.

2319
01:21:08,446 --> 01:21:09,948
I wasn't going to sit there and

2320
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:11,908
let you try to vote me out and

2321
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:13,493
just keep my mouth shut.

2322
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:14,703
I'm sorry, if I hurt your

2323
01:21:14,786 --> 01:21:15,120
feelings, but...

2324
01:21:15,203 --> 01:21:16,913
>> Too late for "I'm sorries."

2325
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:18,957
I've heard you say that... you

2326
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,000
said that directly to me at one

2327
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:21,251
of the tribal councils.

2328
01:21:21,334 --> 01:21:22,502
Too little, too late.

2329
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:23,128
You said that directly to me.

2330
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:25,130
And now you're going to say "I'm

2331
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:26,506
sorry" to me.

2332
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:28,091
I really don't buy that at all.

2333
01:21:28,174 --> 01:21:28,925
>> Okay.

2334
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:31,928
>> I think I'm good.

2335
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:35,473
>> JEFF: Okay.

2336
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:38,977
James.

2337
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,854
How's the finger?

2338
01:21:40,937 --> 01:21:41,980
>> The finger's all right.

2339
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:43,773
It's good.

2340
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:45,400
I mean, I'm not even going to be

2341
01:21:45,483 --> 01:21:46,151
difficult.

2342
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:48,111
Amanda pretty much knows she's

2343
01:21:48,194 --> 01:21:50,030
got it in the bag.

2344
01:21:50,113 --> 01:21:52,198
The only thing is, Parvati, you

2345
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:53,408
fluffed me.

2346
01:21:53,491 --> 01:21:54,576
You did the great move with

2347
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:55,744
Ozzy, and the next day you came

2348
01:21:55,827 --> 01:21:57,787
up to me with a bunch of fluff.

2349
01:21:57,871 --> 01:21:58,872
So we're just going to pretend

2350
01:21:58,955 --> 01:21:59,956
like you didn't say that, have a

2351
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,666
go again, we reenact it, you

2352
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,376
give me a different version.

2353
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:04,628
Go on, give it to me, and make

2354
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:05,670
it believable.

2355
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:07,005
>> Ha, ha, got you, sucker.

2356
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:08,423
What?

2357
01:22:08,506 --> 01:22:09,049
>> That's not it.

2358
01:22:09,132 --> 01:22:09,966
Try a little bit harder.

2359
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,718
>> That is what you wanted me to

2360
01:22:11,801 --> 01:22:12,427
say.

2361
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:13,178
>> No, that's not what I wanted.

2362
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:14,012
>> That's exactly what you said

2363
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:14,471
you wanted me to say.

2364
01:22:14,554 --> 01:22:15,096
>> You're over-exaggerating it.

2365
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:16,890
What I wanted, you to just be

2366
01:22:16,973 --> 01:22:17,682
honest.

2367
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:18,516
"Hey, I'm playing the game.

2368
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,351
It's a game."

2369
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:20,185
I mean, when I play the game...

2370
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:21,102
>> It is a game.

2371
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:22,812
And the game... the motto is

2372
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:23,980
"Outplay, outwit, outlast."

2373
01:22:24,064 --> 01:22:25,023
>> Exactly.

2374
01:22:25,106 --> 01:22:26,524
>> There was no chance for me to

2375
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:27,734
win this game if I stuck with

2376
01:22:27,817 --> 01:22:28,985
you, and if I stuck with Oz.

2377
01:22:29,069 --> 01:22:30,987
There was no chance of me

2378
01:22:31,071 --> 01:22:32,197
sitting here if I stuck with you

2379
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:33,281
guys.

2380
01:22:33,365 --> 01:22:34,491
And that's what I felt.

2381
01:22:34,574 --> 01:22:35,575
I felt like I had to make that

2382
01:22:35,659 --> 01:22:36,701
move when I made it.

2383
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:38,161
It also, you know, gave me a lot

2384
01:22:38,244 --> 01:22:39,371
of control.

2385
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:40,997
And that's what I wanted.

2386
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:43,708
>> Are you finished?

2387
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:44,209
>> Yes.

2388
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:47,796
>> All right.

2389
01:22:47,879 --> 01:22:49,839
>> JEFF: Cirie, you're up.

2390
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:52,258
>> All righty.

2391
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:56,513
Congratulations to both of you.

2392
01:22:56,596 --> 01:22:58,139
I'm going to start with you,

2393
01:22:58,223 --> 01:22:59,557
Amanda.

2394
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:00,183
Being that you had the decision

2395
01:23:00,266 --> 01:23:03,269
to make, tell me and the jury

2396
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:05,105
why Parvati deserves a million

2397
01:23:05,188 --> 01:23:08,566
dollars more than I do.

2398
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:10,443
>> Parvati played a very

2399
01:23:10,527 --> 01:23:13,571
aggressive, bold game.

2400
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:16,032
I think she's stood by her game

2401
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:17,951
the whole time, and I respect

2402
01:23:18,034 --> 01:23:19,160
that about her.

2403
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:20,537
>> So in saying that, are you

2404
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:21,579
saying you don't respect my

2405
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:22,580
game?

2406
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:23,540
>> No, I respect your game as

2407
01:23:23,623 --> 01:23:24,541
well.

2408
01:23:24,624 --> 01:23:26,459
I think Parvati made bolder

2409
01:23:26,543 --> 01:23:27,919
decisions in this game.

2410
01:23:28,002 --> 01:23:28,253
>> Than I did?

2411
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:29,212
>> Yes.

2412
01:23:29,295 --> 01:23:32,215
And I think she was kind of the

2413
01:23:32,298 --> 01:23:33,133
powerhouse in making those

2414
01:23:33,216 --> 01:23:35,427
decisions happen.

2415
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:36,761
>> Okay.

2416
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:40,265
Parvati, I would like you to

2417
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:44,060
tell the jury why I should be

2418
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:45,603
sitting in your seat, and you be

2419
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:47,188
over here on the jury.

2420
01:23:47,272 --> 01:23:48,231
>> I think you played a pretty

2421
01:23:48,314 --> 01:23:50,275
brilliant game.

2422
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:51,651
Yours was a little more, you

2423
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:54,320
know, under the radar than mine

2424
01:23:54,404 --> 01:23:55,572
was, which I think is a great

2425
01:23:55,655 --> 01:23:56,489
strategy, you know, to get up

2426
01:23:56,573 --> 01:23:57,615
here, too.

2427
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:58,908
But I can't compete with a

2428
01:23:58,992 --> 01:23:59,284
mother of three.

2429
01:23:59,367 --> 01:24:00,285
You have kids.

2430
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:02,287
You have a family.

2431
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:03,663
I don't have that.

2432
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:06,374
So based on those two factors, I

2433
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,376
would say it should have been

2434
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:09,753
you right here.

2435
01:24:09,836 --> 01:24:10,462
Is that good?

2436
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:11,629
Is that good enough?

2437
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:12,630
No?

2438
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:13,173
>> I'll ponder over here.

2439
01:24:13,256 --> 01:24:15,133
>> Okay.

2440
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:16,176
>> Thanks, ladies.

2441
01:24:16,259 --> 01:24:17,135
Good luck.

2442
01:24:17,218 --> 01:24:18,970
>> Thanks.

2443
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:20,764
>> JEFF: Thanks, Cirie.

2444
01:24:20,847 --> 01:24:23,433
Ozzy, you're up.

2445
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:31,608
>> I think I might be the

2446
01:24:31,691 --> 01:24:33,109
biggest idiot up here.

2447
01:24:33,193 --> 01:24:36,613
I am truly to the bottom of my

2448
01:24:36,696 --> 01:24:37,197
heart hurt by what you did to

2449
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,532
me.

2450
01:24:39,616 --> 01:24:41,117
It was a great move.

2451
01:24:41,201 --> 01:24:42,535
It really was.

2452
01:24:42,619 --> 01:24:45,497
But I never in a million years

2453
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:46,873
thought that you could do that

2454
01:24:46,956 --> 01:24:48,291
to me.

2455
01:24:48,374 --> 01:24:49,501
You put a price on our

2456
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:50,960
friendship.

2457
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:54,631
You threw us away like garbage.

2458
01:24:54,714 --> 01:24:56,382
You basically said, "You know

2459
01:24:56,466 --> 01:24:57,217
what?

2460
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:58,426
You're not quite worth this much

2461
01:24:58,510 --> 01:24:59,844
money."

2462
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:01,095
And it hurts, you know?

2463
01:25:01,179 --> 01:25:02,972
It really does hurt.

2464
01:25:03,056 --> 01:25:03,598
And how can you say that you're

2465
01:25:03,681 --> 01:25:06,059
a role model when you're willing

2466
01:25:06,142 --> 01:25:07,435
to discard a valuable friendship

2467
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:09,813
like that?

2468
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:11,189
A human being.

2469
01:25:11,272 --> 01:25:13,608
But I don't want words.

2470
01:25:13,691 --> 01:25:14,859
No words at all.

2471
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:21,825
I don't want to talk to you.

2472
01:25:21,908 --> 01:25:23,535
Honestly, the hardest part for

2473
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:25,078
me was the fact that you took

2474
01:25:25,161 --> 01:25:27,455
away 14 days that I could have

2475
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:29,999
spent with Amanda.

2476
01:25:40,385 --> 01:25:42,428
Amanda, when I told you on the

2477
01:25:42,512 --> 01:25:45,515
beach at one point when you

2478
01:25:45,598 --> 01:25:46,933
asked me if I was playing you or

2479
01:25:47,016 --> 01:25:48,768
not, I told you honestly that

2480
01:25:48,852 --> 01:25:50,353
I'm not faking it.

2481
01:25:50,436 --> 01:25:52,313
I'm not faking my feelings for

2482
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:53,398
you or anything, no.

2483
01:25:53,481 --> 01:25:56,317
I really am having feelings that

2484
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:59,696
I've never really felt before

2485
01:25:59,779 --> 01:26:03,867
and have never...

2486
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:07,287
I honestly feel like I started

2487
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:08,371
to fall in love with you.

2488
01:26:08,454 --> 01:26:13,334
And... I don't know.

2489
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:15,378
You're just an amazing girl.

2490
01:26:15,461 --> 01:26:16,629
And I really want everybody to

2491
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:18,047
know that.

2492
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:20,258
And I'm glad I didn't win<i> Cook</i>

2493
01:26:20,341 --> 01:26:21,384
<i>Island</i> so that I could be here

2494
01:26:21,467 --> 01:26:24,012
and have met you.

2495
01:26:24,095 --> 01:26:25,221
>> Thank you.

2496
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:28,683
>> And that's it.

2497
01:26:28,766 --> 01:26:31,936
>> JEFF: All right, jury.

2498
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,147
You've now had your opportunity

2499
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:35,899
to address Amanda and Parvati.

2500
01:26:35,982 --> 01:26:39,652
Certainly, an interesting final

2501
01:26:39,736 --> 01:26:40,320
tribal council, very emotional

2502
01:26:40,403 --> 01:26:42,322
at times.

2503
01:26:42,405 --> 01:26:45,325
Now you have to make a

2504
01:26:45,408 --> 01:26:46,743
million-dollar decision.

2505
01:26:46,826 --> 01:26:48,369
Who do you vote for to win this

2506
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:49,746
game?

2507
01:26:49,829 --> 01:26:51,205
I'm going to give you a moment

2508
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:52,332
to think about your vote.

2509
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:21,402
>> JEFF: All right, jury, Amanda

2510
01:27:21,486 --> 01:27:22,362
and Parvati have had their

2511
01:27:22,445 --> 01:27:24,697
chance to address you.

2512
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:25,907
You've had your chance to

2513
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:27,075
address them.

2514
01:27:27,158 --> 01:27:28,326
Now we get to the vote.

2515
01:27:28,409 --> 01:27:30,244
Tonight you are voting for a

2516
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:32,413
winner-- the name of the person

2517
01:27:32,497 --> 01:27:35,708
you feel most deserving of the

2518
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,669
title of sole survivor, and the

2519
01:27:37,752 --> 01:27:39,003
million-dollar check that goes

2520
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:40,380
with it.

2521
01:27:40,463 --> 01:27:41,923
For the last time, it is time to

2522
01:27:42,006 --> 01:27:43,800
vote.

2523
01:27:43,883 --> 01:27:46,135
Cirie, you're up.

2524
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:02,318
>> I'm willing to forgive and

2525
01:28:02,402 --> 01:28:03,486
forget if you're willing to

2526
01:28:03,569 --> 01:28:04,570
forgive and forget.

2527
01:28:04,654 --> 01:28:07,198
You played a good game.

2528
01:28:19,168 --> 01:28:20,712
>> I love you so much, girl.

2529
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:21,963
You absolutely deserve this.

2530
01:28:22,046 --> 01:28:22,964
And I know you're going to do

2531
01:28:23,047 --> 01:28:24,632
amazing things with this money.

2532
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:42,400
>> I hope to god that you win.

2533
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:43,443
You deserve it a million times

2534
01:28:43,526 --> 01:28:46,362
more than Parvati.

2535
01:28:46,446 --> 01:28:48,865
And... love you.

2536
01:29:14,057 --> 01:29:16,267
>> Oh, my god.

2537
01:29:25,193 --> 01:29:26,652
>> JEFF: I'll go get the votes.

2538
01:29:38,498 --> 01:29:40,458
Amanda, Parvati, jury, thank you

2539
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:43,544
for a great season of<i> Survivor.</i>

2540
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:45,755
I will see you back in the US

2541
01:29:45,838 --> 01:29:48,174
For the reading of the votes.

2542
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:56,724
>> Yes!

2543
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:40,184
>> JEFF: Thank you!

2544
01:30:44,897 --> 01:30:46,190
Let's get to it!

All right.

2547
01:30:51,028 --> 01:30:52,655
Have a seat.

2548
01:30:52,738 --> 01:30:57,827
(<i> cheers and applause</i> )

2549
01:30:57,910 --> 01:30:59,495
Hello.

All right, let's get to this.

2551
01:31:03,124 --> 01:31:07,044
Amanda, Parvati, jury, I've got

2552

2554
01:31:10,715 --> 01:31:13,467
from our first season, this is

2555
01:31:13,551 --> 01:31:14,469
perhaps the best season we've

2556
01:31:14,552 --> 01:31:15,845
ever had.

2557
01:31:15,928 --> 01:31:18,514
(<i> cheers and applause</i> )

2558
01:31:18,598 --> 01:31:22,476
So kudos to you guys.

2559
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:25,188
Now it's time to put it to bed.

2560
01:31:25,271 --> 01:31:28,566
There are eight votes tonight.

2561
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:30,526
It takes five to win.

2562
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:32,737
I will read the votes.

2563
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:43,122
>> Parvati.

2564
01:31:43,206 --> 01:31:46,209
