00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:11,094
DEBBIE WAS LIVING IN THE LAP OF
LUXURY WITH COCHRAN.

3
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:14,472
>> I'M PRESENTING YOU WITH AN
ADVANTAGE OPTION.

4
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:17,726

>> I'M IN WITH SIERRA.

8
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:24,899
YOU JUST ARE TO STICK WITH US.

9
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:32,282
>> Jeff: AT THE NUKU TRIBE,
VARNER AND SANDRA WERE AT THE

10
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,784
BOTTOM BUT TAI BECAME PARANOID.

11
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:39,122
>> THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE THEY
MIGHT BLIND SIDE ME.

12
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:42,000
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL...

13
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,920
>> IF TAI WANTS TO SPIT OUT A
NAME, I'M VOTE WITH YOU, TAI.

14
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,297
>> WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,298
>> I NAMED AS YOU.

16
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:52,302
>> Jeff: BY THROWING OZZY
UNDER THE BUS.

17
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:57,682
IN THE END, SANDRA WAS TOO BIG
OF A THREAT.

18
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:58,725
SANDRA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

19
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,393
>> DON'T DO IT, JEFF.

20
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:13,782
>> Jeff: DEBBIE JOINED THE
NUKU TRIBE.

21
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:17,994
>> THAT TRIBAL WAS SCARIER THAN
EXILE.

22
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:20,163
( LAUGHTER )
>> HOW WAS IT?

23
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,164
>> WOOO!

24
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,332
>> HOW ARE YOU?

25
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,625
>> OH, I'M GOOD.

26
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:27,003
I MAY BE THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS
EVER GOT TO SIT IN AND BE PRIVY

27
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:30,423
TO A TRIBAL COUNCIL LIKE THAT
WITHOUT HAVING JURY DUTY.

28
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:35,220
AND NOW SANDRA IS GONE, AND I AM
BACK WITH NUKU, WHERE I BELONG.

29
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,846
IT'S GOOD TO BE HOME.

30
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,889
>> IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

31
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:38,681
>> OH, GOD.

32
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,225
>> I HOPE EXILE WASN'T TOO
TERRIBLE?

33
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,227
>> IT WAS, BUT--
>> HEY.

34
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,729
>> THAT'S WHY I'M PLAYING THIS
GAME.

35
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,189
>> RIGHT.

36
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:49,526
>> THERE WAS NO FLIPT, YOU GUYS?

37
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,027
>> THERE WAS NO FLINT?

38
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:51,820
>> NO.

39
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,656
>> SO PEOPLE ASKED ME ABOUT
EXILE.

40
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,366
LOOK, WHAT HAPPENED ON EXILE
STAYS ON EXILE.

41
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:01,162
AND I HAVE NO INTENTION OF
LETTING MYSELF OR MR. COCHRAN

42
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:01,746
DOWN.

43
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,081
LIPS ARE SEALED.

44
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,124
>.GREAT TO BE BACK.

45
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,417
>> ME, TOO.

46
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,212
I WAS ABOUT TO VOTE TAI OUT.

47
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,214
>> YOU WERE WORRIED, REALLY?

48
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,465
NO, YOU WERE NOT.

49
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,885
>> I WAS SUPER WORRIED AND IT'S
ONLY BECAUSE IT WAS ONE OF THOSE

50
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:16,719
THINGS--
>> YOUR NAME.

51
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,347
>> YEAH, YOU'RE JUST LIKE OH, MY
GOD.

52
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,599
>> THE CONVERSATION CONFUSED ME.

53
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,767
I SAID MY GOD.

54
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,435
I MIGHT BE AT THE BOTTOM RIGHT
NOW.

55
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,897
AND OZZY IS THE ONLY NAME THAT
MAKES SENSE.

56
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,067
OZZY IS A THREAT.

57
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,069
HE WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.

58
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:35,905
I SAY IT OUT LOUD BECAUSE I
THINK I NEED TO GO THERE.

59
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,741
I'M TERRIBLE AT TRIBAL AND THAT
WORRIED ME A LITTLE BIT.

60
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,870
>> WHEN YOU GUYS STARTED TALKING
ABOUT OZZY, I COVERED MY HANDS

61
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:45,081
OVER AND WAS PEEK OUT LIKE IT
WAS A HORROR MOVIE.

62
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:47,542
I WAS LIKE, "DON'T YOU GUYS TURN
ON HIM."

63
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,586
I WAS PEEKING OUT MY FINGERS.

64
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,297
I THOUGHT OH, MY GOD, THIS IS
WORSE THAN EXILE.

65
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,506
LEAST I HAD PEACE THERE.

66
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,427
>> SO IN CASE MY NAME IS OUT
THERE, I HAVE TWO IDOLS, BUT I'M

67
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,094
NERVOUS.

68
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:03,474
SOMEHOW THIS THING HAPPENS...

69
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,727
>> YOU GUYS REALLY BURNED A LOT
OF WOOD.

70
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:11,274
>> WE DID I GOT BLINDSIDES BIG
TIME.

71
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,735

72
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:17,030
I WANT TO PUNCH THEM ALL IN THE
THROAT BOARNG EVERY ONE OF THEM.

73
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,114
I'M MAD BUT I CAN'T SHOW IT.

74
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,408
I CAN'T LET THEM KNOW THAT I'M
MAD BECAUSE I NEED THEM.

75
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:25,788
>> I'M SO SORRY ABOUT NOT
INCLUDING YOU IN THE VOTE

76
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,414
TONIGHT.

77
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:26,831
IT SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.

78
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,082
>> THAT'S FINE.

79
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,126
>> BUT--
>> IT'S A NAME GAME, YOU KNOW,

80
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,296
AND I'VE NOT INCLUDED PEOPLE IN
MY PLANS, TOO, SO IT'S MY TURN

81
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:37,634
TO GET BLINDSIDED AND IT'S OKAY.

82
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,760
I'M STILL HERE.

83
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,428
I WOULD HAVE VOTED FOR HER
WITHOUT TELLING HER ANYTHING.

84
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,889
WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ALL THAT.

85
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,515
I WENT TO WORK IMMEDIATELY.

86
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,308
WHY NOT?

87
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,434
I MEAN, WHY WAIT?

88
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:50,647

00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,909
LET'S EAT!

346
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:29,702
LET'S EAT!

347
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:34,081
>> WE DOMINATED THE REWARD
CHALLENGE.

348
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,666
IT WAS EPIC.

349
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,251
>> CHEERS!

350
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,419
>> CHEERS!

351
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:41,255
>> AT THIS STAGE OF THE GAME,
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE

352
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,173
TRIBE MORAL TO WIN SOMETHING
LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE GAME IS

353
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:47,970
JUST STARTING TO WEAR ON PEOPLE,
AND THE EXTRA BOOST IS THE MOST

354
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:48,804
IMPORTANT THING RIGHT NOW.

355
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:50,931
>> OH, MY GOOD GOD!

356
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,517
>> I'M GOING TO DESTROY THIS
PIZZA.

357
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,727
>> I'LL EAT THIS WHOLE THING.

358
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,980
>> IT FELT SO GOOD TO FINALLY
JUMP UP AND DOWN AND SAY, "WE

359
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:58,897
WON."

360
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,108
BUT I'M ON THE BOTTOM WHEN YOU
LOOK AT IT.

361
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:04,653
SO TO WIN SOMETHING LIKE THAT
DOESN'T MEAN A DAMN THING.

362
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,197
>> OH, MY GOD, OZZY, MAY I JUST
SAY, YOU'RE A BEAST, BABE.

363
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,701
>> IT WAS ALL YOU GUYS JUST
DIRECTING ME HOW TO DO IT

364
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:11,910
BECAUSE I COOPERATE HAVE DONE
IT.

365
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:15,122
>> I AM THINKING TO MYSELF, IF I
WANT TO SAVE MY OWN BUTT OUT

366
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,206
HERE.

367
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,335
>> HAVE TO FIND THE WAY TO THROW
THE SHADE ON SMEBLES.

368
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,879
OZZY IS WELL ROUNDED, HE'LL WIN
THIS GAME.

369
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,130
OZZY IS VERY STRONG.

370
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:26,133
YOU LET HIM LOOSE IN INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY CHALLENGES, HE'LL WIN

371
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:30,846
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM SO NOW
IS THE TIME TO GET RID OF OZZY.

372
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:33,349
NOW IS THE TIME.

373
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,477
GUYS NEED ME AS MUCH AS I NEED
YOU WHEN IT COMES TO A MERGE.

374
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,186
>> ABSOLUTELY.

375
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,187
>> AND I THINK IT WILL BE GOOD.

376
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,188
>> YEAH.

377
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,565
OKAY, SO, SAY WE MERGE.

378
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,318
DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE GOT
PEOPLE OVER THERE THAT WE CAN

379
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:44,610
BRING IN?

380
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,362
>> YES.

381
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,030
>> OKAY.

382
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:51,533
TODAY, AFTER THE REWARD, VARNER
STARTS SAYING, "I REALLY WANT TO

383
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,410
WORK WITH YOU GUYS."

384
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:58,374
AND I THINK WE CAN PULL VARNER
AND ACTUALLY USE HIM AS A

385
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,500
NUMBER.

386
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,043
AND I REALLY, TRULY FEEL WE HAVE
MADE THAT CONNECTION.

387
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,046
SO DO YOU HAVE YOUR EYES ON
ANYONE THAT YOU WANT TO GET RID

388
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,216
OF FIRST, EAR DO YOU NOT CARE
AND WE CAN LET EVERYONE ELSE

389
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:07,883
DECIDE?

390
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:09,760
>> I WANT TO GET RID OF OZZY.

391
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,220
>> YOU DO.

392
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,054
>> I DO?

393
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,305
>> JUST SO WE ALL HAVE A
FIGHTING CHANCE.

394
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:18,102
I'M SICK OF WATCHING "SURVIVOR"
WHERE ALL THE A.PEOPLE GET TO

395
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:21,522
THE END AND PEOPLE LIKE US JUST
SORT OF SIT THERE AND HOPE HE

396
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:21,980
LOSES.

397
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,023
I DON'T WANT THAT.

398
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,400
I'D LIKE TO WIN THAT NECKLACE

400
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:31,115
THEN HE SAYS COULD OZZY
POTENTIALLY BE THE VOTE?

401
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,658
THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING OF
RIGHT NOW.

402
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,911
I NEED TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE
THAT'S A HUGE MOVE BUT I'M READY

403
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:37,955
TO PROVE WHY I AM A GAME
CHANGER.

404

>> Jeff: COULD MANA BE RIGHT?

514
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,380
>> CULPEPPER THINKS SO.

515
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,591
>> Jeff: WHAT IS IT?

516
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,760
>> METAMORPHOSIS.

517
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:29,347
>> Jeff: MANA WINS IMMUNITY
WITH MET MORPH FIST.

518
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:35,103
THE ONE WORD THAT CAPTURES WHAT
"SURVIVOR" IS ABOUT.

519
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:39,649
>> OH, MY GOODNESS!

520
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,777
>> Jeff: MANA,
CONGRATULATIONS.

521
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,111
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS YOURS.

522
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,822
<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM YOUR

523
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:46,281
TRIBE.

524
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,157
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

525
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:53,288
HEAD ON OUT.

526
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:56,291
ALL RIGHT, NUKU, TRIBAL COUNCIL
TONIGHT WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE

527
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,126
THE SEVENTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF
THIS GAME.

528
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,419
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

529
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,671
>> I KNOW I'M PROBABLY IN
TROUBLE.

530
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:02,714
I'M ON MY OWN.

531
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,633
I HAVE TO MAKE EVERYBODY VOTE
FOR OZZY.

532
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:08,678
AND I'LL BE DOING EVERYTHING I
CAN TO GUARANTEE I'M NOT THE ONE

533
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,681
GOING HOME.

534
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:29,616
>> AAH!

535
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:30,659
I WASN'T EVEN CLOSE.

536
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,952
WAS ANYONE CLOSE?

537
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:32,577
>> NO.

538
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,329
>> THAT ONE IS ON ALL OF US.

539
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,706
WE ALL WERE STANDING THERE
STARING AT THOSE LETTERS.

540
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,208
NOBODY DID ANYTHING WRONG.

541
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,042
>> NO.

542
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,837
>> SO IT'S SCRAMBLE AFTERNOON,
HUNAHPU?

543
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,587
YEAH.

544
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,006
>> I GUESS MY NAME IS ON THE
BLOCK.

545
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,676
CAN I HAVE ONE-ON-ONE TIME WITH
EVERYBODY?

546
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,637
I'LL MAKE MY PITCH AND BE AT
PEACE.

547
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,639
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIE TO ME.

548
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:53,849
I DON'T HAVE AN IDOL.

549
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,726
>> ANYBODY NEED WATER?

550
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,688
>> I'LL GO WITH YOU.

551
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,689
>> GOOD.

552
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,190
>> PERFECT.

553
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,358
FIVE OF US ARE HERE.

554
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:07,529
>> OKAY, MY GUT-- AND IT'S JUST
MY GUT.

555
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,613
I WANT EVERYBODY TO TALK.

556
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:14,411
IF WE HAD TO TAKE A VOTE NOW,
CAN WE JUST DO IT QUICK.

557
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,078
VARNER.

558
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,329
WHAT DOES YOUR GUT SAY SARAH?

559
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,415
>> MY GUT SAYS GET RID OF OZZY.

560
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:19,374
>> TONIGHT?

561
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,918
>> I TRUST VARNER MORE THAN OZZY
AT THIS POINT.

562
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,713
HE MAY NOT STICK WITH US FOREVER
BUT FOR A COUPLE VOTES.

563
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:28,758
I DON'T THINK OZZY WILL STICK
WITH US FOR A COUPLE OF VOTES SO

564
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:32,387
THAT'S JUST MY PERSPECTIVE BUT
I'LL VOTE WHEREVER YOU GUYS

565
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,555
VOTE.

566
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,390
>> I WOULD LIKE NOTHING MORE
THAN KEEP VARNER IN THE GAME.

567
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,517
I LIKE HIM AS A PERSON, I DO.

568
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,020
BUT TO BE HONEST, I THINK OUR
BEST BEST IS TO STICK-- I REALLY

569
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,688
THINK OZZY WANTS TO VOTE WITH US
FOR ONE OR TWO VOTES.

570
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,565
>> I DON'T KNOW.

571
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,734
YOU GUYS, I'M REALLY CONVICTED.

572
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:49,070
>> I WANT TO SAFE JEFF VARNER,
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT, BUT I DON'T

573
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:53,074
WANT TO LOSE RAWZ OZY BECAUSE
THE WAY I'VE SET IT UP IS TO

574
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,410
HAVE BIGGER THREATS OUT THERE
THAN MYSELF.

575
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:58,747
SO WE'RE IN A PRECARIOUS
POSITION.

576
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,917
>> WHAT'S THE PROBABILITY IN
YOUR MIND THAT I'M GOING HOME

577
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,584
TONIGHT?

578
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,254
>> HONESTLY, IT'S ABOUT 50%.

579
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,339
>> OKAY.

580
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,424
>> AND I'M JUST LETTING YOU KNOW
BECAUSE I LIKE YOU.

581
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:10,050
>> NO, I APPRECIATE IT.

582
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,552
I TOLD YOU ALL TO LET ME GO.

583
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:13,428
>> YEAH.

584
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:15,430
>> SO YOU DON'T WANT TO GET RID
OF OZZY.

585
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:18,391
>> LOOK, VARNER, I'M GOING TO DO
WHAT I CAN TO SAVE YOU.

586
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,811
I'M GOING TO BE PERFECTLY
HONEST, I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN.

587
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,731
>> ZEKE HAS BEEN MY PARTNER AND
I THOUGHT I COULD PITCH, "LET'S

588
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:29,903
GET RID OF OZZY," BUT WHEN I
THREW THAT OUT THERE ZEKE SHUT

589
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:33,573
ME DOWN WHICH WAS VERY TELLING
TO ME BECAUSE ZEKE DOES NOT WANT

590
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,575
TO GET RID OF OZZY.

591
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,494
WHAT I DO NEED TO DO TO STAY
HERE?

592
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:41,998
>> I DON'T KNOW, BUT ANDREA AND
CIERA ARE GOING TO MAKE YOU FEEL

593
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:42,582
SAFE.

594
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,961
>> A LITE BULB WENT OFF.

595
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,380
AS YOUY AND ZEKE MAY BE WORKING
TOGETHER.

596
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:51,174
I FEEL LIKE ZEKE IS WORKING WITH
OZZY MORE THAN HE'S WORKING WITH

597
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,092
YOU AND ANDREA.

598
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,301
>> REALLY?

599
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,304
>> ZEKE SAT ME DOWN AND HE SAID,
"YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING HOME."

600
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,222
>> YEAH.

601
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:57,639
>> AND THE GIRLS ARE GOING TO
LIE TO YOU.

602
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,598
>> WHAT?

603
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:02,686
>> BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T WANT
YOU TO KNOW.

604
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:07,148
ZEKE IS WORKING BOTH SIDES, AND
I LET SARAH KNOW THAT, AND IT

605
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:07,691
PISSED HER OFF.

606
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,317
>> ZEKE IS WORK OZZY.

607
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,568
HE'S NOT ON YOUR TEAM.

608
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:15,824
IF I'M GOING THOAM TONIGHT, I'M
GOING TO CUT THEM ALL OFF AT THE

609
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:16,491
KNEES.

610
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:17,784
ZEKE IS NOT BEING TRUTHFUL.

611
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,287
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT ZEKE
NOBODY KNOWS.

612
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,664
I FEEL LIKE I KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT ZEKE THAT NOBODY ELSE HAS

613
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:26,835
PICKED UP ON, IS INSIGNIFICANT
TO THIS GAME.

614
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,838
IT MEANS NOTHING, BUT THIS IS
NOT THE GUY YOU THINK HE IS.

615
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,006
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE HERE.

616
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,717
IF I HAVE TO GO TO TRIBAL
TONIGHT AND RAISE MORTAL HELL,

617
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,677
I'M GOING TO DO IT.

618
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,804
I'M NOT GOING QUIETLY OFF THIS
ISLAND.

619
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,347
>> WHY WOULD ZEKE DO THAT?

620
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,515
>> BECAUSE HE'S A COWARD.

621
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,851
>> THAT PISSES ME OFF, ANDREA.

622
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:46,187
>> IT MADE ME MAD, TOO, I WAS
PISSED.

623
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,190
>> I'M IRATE RIGHT NOW.

624
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,817
ZEKE THREW US UNDER THE BUS.

625
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,654
I REALIZE THAT, BUT RIGHT NOW,
ZEKE IS WITH US, SO WE'LL GET

626
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,739
THROUGH THIS VOTE BUT IT'S NOT
COOL.

627
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:56,948
>> IS HE?

628
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:00,994
ZEKE SAT HIM DOWN AND SAID THE
GIRLS ARE GOING TO LIE TO YOU

629
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,704
JUST TO MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD.

630
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:03,872
AND I'M LIKE WHAT?

631
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:07,500
WHY WOULD YOU THROW US UNDER THE
BUS SO YOU COULD SAVE FACE.

632
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,544
THINGS ARE STARTING TO LOOK
WEIRD NOW.

633
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:12,672
ZEKE DIDN'T DOESN'T WANT TO GET
RID OF OZZY AND ZEKE THREW

634
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,883
ANDREA AND I UNDER THE BUS AND
I'M LIKE THIS IS KIND OF

635
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,134
STARTING TO STINK.

636
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:19,888
DO ZEKE AND OZZY HAVE SOMETHING
MORE GOING ON THAT I DON'T KNOW

637
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:20,513
ABOUT?

638
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,723
AND THAT REALLY SCARES ME.

639
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:25,894
THIS COULD BE A HUGE MISTAKE,
BUT MAYBE WE NEED TO GET RID OF

640
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,980
OZZY, AND KEEP VENTURA.

I TRIED MY BEST TO NOT BE NEXT,
BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THAT

649

657
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:32,794
MYSELF TO BE ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED
TONIGHT.

658

>>
>> Jeff: JEFF, TELL ME WHAT

659
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:34,754
HAPPENED AT CAMP?

660
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,798
DID EVERYBODY JUST SAY, "VARNER,
YOU'RE GOING HOME?"

661
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,592
>> I WENT AND TALKED TO EACH
PERSON INDIVIDUALLY AFTER THE

662
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:40,802
CHALLENGE TODAY.

663
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,429
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO PEOPLE FOR
THE LAST TWO AND A HALF DAYS.

664
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:47,475
I FEEL LIKE I KNOW-- KNEW--
WHERE PEOPLE STOOD.

665
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,477
I FELT LIKE I WAS GETTING IN THE
CRACKS.

666
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,020
I FELT LIKE I WAS MOVING OFF THE
BOTTOM.

667
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:55,275
BUT IT WAS REVEALED TO ME TODAY
HOW LITTLE I KNEW ABOUT WHAT

668
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,944
ACTUALLY IS GOING ON HERE AT OLD
CAMP NUKU.

669
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,821
THEY ARE NOT SIX STRONG.

670
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:04,993
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN ARGUING ALL
DAY LONG WHO DO YOU WANT TO VOTE

671
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,161
OUT?

672
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,996
HALF THE GROUP SAYS, "IF YOU GET
ENOUGH NUMBERS TO VOTE OZZY,

673
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,833
I'LL VOTE OZZY, BECAUSE OZZY IS
A STRATEGIC THREAT.

674
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,543
HE IS THE TOTAL PACKAGE."

675
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:17,589
SO IT BEGAN TO REVEAL ITSELF TO
ME THAT THERE WAS A SECRET

676
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:20,884
ALLIANCE BETWEEN ZEKE AND OZZY.

677
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,093

00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:30,143
BOOM, BOOM, AND BOOM.

682
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,019
BOTTOM.

683
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,689
SO I AM PROPOSING TONIGHT VOTE
FOR OZZY.

684
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:35,899
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF THE WHOLE
SITUATION IF YOU WILL VOTE AND

685
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,984
YOU WILL VOTE AND YOU WILL VOTE.

686
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:40,361
I'LL HOOK US UP.

687
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:41,863
THAT'S THE PITCH I'M MAKING TO
YOU TODAY.

688
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,490
>> THAT'S GOOD.

689
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:44,032
>> THERE IS DECEPTION HERE.

690
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,200
>> YEAH.

691
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:49,078
>> DECEPTIONS ON LEVELS, JEFF,
THAT THESE GUYS DON'T EVEN

692
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:49,496
UNDERSTAND.

693
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,205
THERE'S MORE.

694
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,247
>> Jeff: CONTINUE.

695
00:29:51,331 --> 00:30:04,552
>> WHY HAVEN'T YOU TOLD ANYONE
YOU'RE TRANSGENDER?

696
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,013
WHAT I'M SHOWING IS A DECEPTION.

697
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,681
>> BUT THAT'S PERSONAL.

698
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,184
>> THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
THE GAME.

699
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,685
>> THAT'S NOT A DECEPTION.

700
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:13,895
>> YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

701
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:14,979
>> THAT IS SO WRONG.

702
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,064
FOR TO YOU BRING THAT UP.

703
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,107
>> I'M NOT USING THAT AS
ANYTHING NEGATIVE.

704
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,860
>> THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
THE GAME.

705
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:21,402
THAT'S PERSONAL.

706
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,570
>> I'M NOT KNOCKING HIM.

707
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:26,074
>> THAT'S NOT DECEPTION--
>> THAT WAS SOMETHING TO REVEAL

708
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,283
WHO WHOM HE WANTED.

709
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:30,119
>> I ARGUE FOR THE RIGHTS OF
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE EVERY DAY IN

710
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,204
THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA.

711
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:33,915
I WOULD NEVER SAY OR DO ANYTHING
TO HURT ANYONE HERE.

712
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,543
JEFF, I'M ARGUING FOR MY LIFE.

713
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,044
I FEEL LIKE I'VE GOT TO THROW
EVERYTHING AT THE WALL.

714
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:41,798
>> OUTING SOMEBODY--
>> I'M NOT OUTING HIM.

715
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,091
>> YES, YOU ARE!

716
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,592
YOU OUTED HIM!

717
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,219
NOBODY HAS THE RIGHT TO OUT
ANYBODY.

718
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,428
>> I AGREE WITH TAI.

719
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:51,140
IT WAS FOR ZEKE TO DISCUSS WHEN
HE WAS COMFORTABLE DISCUSSING

720
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,225
IT.

721
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:58,940
>> IN TWO REASONS I PLAYED
"SURVIVOR," I TOLD NOBODY.

722
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,277
>> I DON'T WANT THE PERCEPTION
TO BE THAT I'M THIS EVIL,

723
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,069
HATEFUL PERSON.

724
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,405
>> WHAT WAS YOUR GOAL IN DOING
THAT?

725
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,490
>> TO SHOW THIS DECEPTION.

726
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:11,160
>> THAT ISN'T DECEIVING US
STRATEGICALLY IN A GAME.

727
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,412
I DON'T THII DON'T THINK SO.

728
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:17,083
>> IT REVEALS THE ABILITY TO
DECEIVE.

729
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:21,296
>> Jeff: JEFF, WHEN YOU SAY BY
REJEELG THAT ZEKE IS

730
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,964
TRANSGENDER, YOU'RE PROVING THAT
HE'S DECEPTIVE--

731
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,009
>> I'M NOT SAYING, JEFF, THAT
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE ARE

732
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,218
DECEPTIVE.

733
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:30,096
>> Jeff: NO, YOU'RE SAYING BY
HIM NOT REVEALING IT THAT HE'S

734
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:30,763
CAPABLE OF DECEPTION.

735
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,682
THAT IS A GIANT LEAP OF LOGIC.

736
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:33,766
DO YOU HONESTLY NOT SEE THAT?

737
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,434
>> I DO SEE THAT.

738
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,477
AND I FEEL HORRIBLE ABOUT IT.

739
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,271
I'M JUST TRYING EVERYTHING THAT
I CAN.

740
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:40,106
AND I AM SO SORRY, ZEKE.

741
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,317
I'M NOT-- I SUPPORT YOU.

742
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,444
>> Jeff: JERVEG YOU CAN'T
UNRING THE BELL.

743
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,654
>> I'M NOT UNRINGING THE BELL.

744
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,780
I'M JUST APOLOGIZING, JEFF.

745
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,324
>> JEFF, YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF.

746
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,491
>> I AM A LITTLE BIT.

747
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,995
>> I SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF
YOURSELF FOR WHAT YOU'RE WILLING

748
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:57,165
TO DO TO GET YOURSELF FURTHER IN
A GAME FOR $1 MILLION.

749
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,833
YOU'RE PLAYING WITH PEOPLE'S
LIVES AT THIS POINT.

750
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:03,212
>> AND I AM SO SORRY, ZEKE.

751
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:07,675
>> Jeff: JEFF, WHEN YOU LOOK
AT ZEKE'S EXPRESSION, WHO

752
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:12,972
TYPICALLY IS VERY CONNECTED, AND
NOW JUST VISUALLY TO ME LOOKS A

753
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:16,184
LITTLE BIT LIKE HE'S ON AN
ISLAND OF HIS OWN, DO YOU--

754
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,685
>> ZEKE, I'M SORRY.

755
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,353
>> Jeff: YOU'RE SORRY?

756
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,687
>> I'M SORRY.

757
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,189
THAT'S NOT THE INTENTION I HAD.

758
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,190
>> THERE'S A GREAT KICK TORE
THIS.

759
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,359
I REALLY LIKED VARNER.

760
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,028
I THOUGHT WE, LIKE, CONNECTED
OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS.

761
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,571
WE SHARED A LOT OF STORIES.

762
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,781
HE SHARED A LOT ABOUT HIS LIFE.

763
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:33,534
AND IT'S BEEN TEARING ME UP THAT
I HAD TO VOTE THIS GUY OUT.

764
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:38,206
AND I'M THE ONE WHO GAVE HIM THE
HEADS UP TODAY BECAUSE I DIDN'T

765
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,041
WANT TO BLINDSIDE HIM.

766
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:44,212
>> Jeff: JEFF WHAT, DO YOU
THINK THE L.G.B.T.EE COMMUNITY

767
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,088
REACTION WILL BE TO THIS?

768
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,673
>> THE COMMUNITY AROUND ME KNOWS
WHO I AM.

769
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,384
THEY KNOW WHAT I SUPPORT.

770
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,052
MY TRANSGENDER FRIENDS KNOW WHO
I AM AND WHAT I SUPPORT.

771
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:55,181
AND THEY KNOW I'M NOT THIS
HORRIBLE MONSTER.

772
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:59,560
>> Jeff: BUT IN A WAY, YOU'RE
SAYING THERE IS NO LINE, IF I'M

773
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,437
DESPERATE ENOUGH, I WILL DO OR
SAY ANYTHING.

774
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:05,441
>> IT'S A GAME FOR A MILLION
DOLLARS, AND I CLEARLY HAVE MADE

775
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,068
THE WRONG CHOICE TONIGHT.

776
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:10,697
AND MY CONSCIENCE IS IN PAIN.

777
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,781
I FEEL HORRIBLE.

778
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,533
I DIDN'T THINK THAT WOULDN'T
REACTION.

779
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:16,244
I THOUGHT HE WAS PROUD AND OUT
AND LOUD ABOUT IT.

780
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:20,123
AND I DIDN'T DNOT UNDERSTAND
WHAT EXACTLY--

781
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:23,751
>> IF YOU THOUGHT HE WAS OUT AND
PROUD AND LOUD ABOUT IT, WHY DID

782
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,921
YOU MAKE IT A POINT THAT
EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE TO KNOW

783
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:27,755
THAT?

784
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:28,756
>> BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED
IT.

785
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,633
AND HE--
>> BECAUSE HE'S NOT OUT AND

786
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:31,426
PROUD AND LOUD ABOUT IT.

787
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,552
>> I GET THAT NOW.

788
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:35,096
YOU GUYS, I'M GOING TO BEAT
MYSELF UP ENOUGH ALREADY.

789
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,682
>> Jeff: JEFF, YOU CAN'T HAVE
IT BOTH WAYS.

790
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:40,893
YOU CAN'T SAY ON ONE HAND THE
REASON I'M TELLING PEOPLE IS TO

791
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,771
PROVE THAT HE'S CAPABLE OF
DECEPTION, AND THEN IMMEDIATELY

792
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,773
SAY, "HE WAS OUT AND PROUD OF
IT."

793
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:46,607
BOTH CAN'T EXIST.

794
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,110
>> AND I'M SO SORRY, ZEKE.

795
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,112
I'M SO SORRY.

796
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:55,116
>> Jeff: TAI,S AS A PLAYER IN
THIS GAME, AND AS A GAY MAN

797
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:59,078
YOURSELF, YOU ARE CLEARLY VERY
UPSET AND LET JEFF KNOW IT.

798
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,080
HOW ARE YOU FEELING NOW?

799
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:05,376
>> I THINK I CAN UNDERSTAND
VARNER.

800
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,129
HE WAS JUST DEPS EXPRAT TRYING
TO SAVE HIMSELF.

801
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,173
I THINK HE CROSSED A LINE AND
DIDN'T REALIZE HE DID.

802
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:13,968
I THINK HE SINCERELY FEELS BAD
ABOUT IT.

803
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:16,929
AND HE JUST HAS TO LIVE WITH IT.

804
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,932
BUT STILL, I HAVE THIS REALLY
STRONG STAND, WHENEVER YOU WANT

805
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:23,311
TO COME OUT AS A GAY PERSON, AS
TRANSGENDER, IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

806
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,022
NOBODY SHOULD OUT ANYBODY.

807
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:29,150
>> Jeff: ANDREA, YOU HAD A
VERY BIG AND INSTANT REACTION.

808
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,027
YOU'RE STILL EMOTIONAL ABOUT IT.

809
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,945
>> I DON'T KNOW.

810
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,614
I'VE BEEN PLAYING WITH ZEKE FOR
18 DAYS.

811
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,823
AND I DIDN'T KNOW.

812
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:39,160
AND JUST TO SEE SOMEONE OUT
SOMEONE ELSE IS PRETTY PAINFUL.

813
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:44,916
BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT JEFF IS
FEELING VERY ON THE OUTS AND

814
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,710
HE'S VERY DESPERATE, SO I DO
BELIEVE HE REGRETS IT.

815
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,671
IT'S JUST-- THAT WAS REALLY
TOUGH.

816
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,547
I FEEL-- I REALLY FEEL FOR ZEKE.

817
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:55,176
YOU KNOW, IT'S HIS RIGHT TO TELL
PEOPLE.

818
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:59,972
>> Jeff: VARNER, IS IT
STARTING TO HIT YOU THE GRAVITY

819
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:03,851
THAT YOU DIDN'T JUST TELL SIX
PEOPLE.

820
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:07,021
YOU TOLD MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.

821
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,564
IS THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING?

822
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:12,652
YOU'RE REALIZING NOW THIS WAS--
>> JEFF, I ASSUMED THAT EVERYONE

823
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,695
IN HIS WORLD KNEW.

824
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,573
SO THAT'S MY IGNORANCE.

825
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:20,827
AND I THOUGHT HE WAS JUST
DECEIVING THESE PEOPLE.

826
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,538
IT NEVER DAWNED ON ME THAT NO
ONE KNEW.

827
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:29,710
AND SO, I'M JUST DEVASTATED.

828
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:35,383
>> Jeff: ZEKE, YOU'VE BEEN
AMAZINGLY STRONG THROUGH THIS.

829
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,427
WAS THIS SOMETHING THAT WAS A
PART OF YOUR LIFE?

830
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:41,222
WERE YOU OUT TO YOUR FRIENDS?

831
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:44,392
OR WAS IT EVEN ANYTHING THAT WAS
IN YOUR NORMAL DAILY LIFE?

832
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,185
>> WELL, CERTAINLY.

833
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:49,230
YOU KNOW, BEING TRANS,
TRANSITIONING, IT'S A LONG

834
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:49,897
PROCESS.

835
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,233
IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS.

836
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,360
AND, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO KNOW.

837
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:57,905
BUT THEN I SORT OF GOT TO A
POINT WHERE I STOPPED TELLING

838
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,283
PEOPLE BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE KNOW
THAT ABOUT YOU, THAT'S SORT OF

839
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,493
WHO YOU ARE.

840
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,911
THERE ARE QUESTIONS PEOPLE ASK.

841
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,206
PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR
LIFE, AND THEY WANT TO KNOW THE

842
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,916
THIS AND THAT.

843
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,586
SORT OF OVERWHELMS EVERYTHING
ELSE THEY KNOW ABOUT YOU.

844
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,379
>> Jeff: YOU'RE NO LONGER
ZEKE.

845
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:16,883
>> RIGHT, YOU'RE THE TRANS
PERSON.

846
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,594
AND I THINK I'VE BEEN FORTUNATE
TO PLAY "SURVIVOR" AS LONG AS

847
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:20,761
I'VE BEEN PLAYING IT AND NOT
HAVE THAT LABEL.

848
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,931
AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I
DIDN'T WANT TO LEAD WITH THAT

849
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:28,644
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO BE THE
"TRANS" SURVIVOR PLAYER AND I

850
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,354
WANTED TO BE ZEKE THE SURVIVOR
PLAYER.

851
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:30,938
>> YOU ARE.

852
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,107
>> AND I FEEL LIKE I AM.

853
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,110
I KNEW SOMEONE MIGHT PICK UP ON
IT OR IT MIGHT BE REVEALED.

854
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:39,447
SO I AM PREPARED TO TALK ABOUT
IT, TO HAVE IT BE PART OF MY

855
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,364
"SURVIVOR" EXPERIENCE.

856
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,909
IT'S KIND OF CRAPPY THE WAY IT'S
HAPPENED.

857
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:43,910
>> I'M SORRY, ZEKE.

858
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,036
I'M SORRY.

859
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,957
>> BUT, YOU KNOW, METAMORPHOSIS
IS THE WORD OF THE SHOW.

860
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,419
I THINK I'VE SEEN SUCH A MET
MORPH FIST OF MYSELF, TODAY IS

861
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:56,631
52 OF THE DAY OF PLAYED
"SURVIVOR."

862
00:36:56,714 --> 00:37:00,968
AND I DON'T KNOW THE SCARED KID
WHO HIT THE MAP AT 33 WOULD BE

863
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,595
AS CALM AS I AM RIGHT NOW.

864
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,972
BUT I'VE STARTED TWO FIRES WITH
JUST BAMBOO.

865
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,140
I'VE WON CHALLENGES.

866
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:08,309
I'VE BEEN PART OF BLINDSIDES.

867
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:11,812
I'VE DONE ALL KINDS OF CRAZY
STUFF AND I AM A CHANGED,

868
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,981
STRONGER, BETTER MAN TODAY THAN
I WAS THEN.

869
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,524
SO, YOU KNOW, WHAT?

870
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:16,609
VARNER, IT'S REALLY NOT COOL.

871
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,277
BUT YOU KNOW, I'M FINE.

872
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:21,364
>> YOU DON'T HAVE A BIGGER
CHEERLEADER IN ANYONE BUT ME.

873
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,491
>> I DON'T EVEN NEED A
CHEERLEADER.

874
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,450
>> I KNOW.

875
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,660
>> BECAUSE I KNOW I CAN DO
WHATEVER I WANT TO.

876
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,286
>> I KNOW.

877
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,621
I'M SO SORRY.

878
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:33,668
NOW THAT I CAN SIT HERE AND SEE
WHAT HAPPENED, I'M SHOCKED.

879
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,629
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I DID THAT.

880
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:37,713
AND I FEEL HORRIBLE.

881
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:42,510
>> Jeff: SARAH, YOU'RE STILL
SHAKE YOUR HEAD AT VARNER.

882
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:52,687
>> I'M-- THAT'S NOT ME.

883
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:57,358
AND... LIKE-- I'M SORRY THAT I'M
CRYING THIS BUT --

884
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:01,362
>> WHEN YOU SAY, "THAT'S NOT
ME," WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

885
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,948
>> THAT WAS A MALICIOUS ATTACK,
WHAT HE DID.

886
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:06,409
IT WAS I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU
SAID.

887
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:07,576
>> THERE WAS NOT MALICE IN THAT.

888
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,036
>> IT WAS.

889
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,329
THAT'S YOUR OPINION.

890
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,247
MINE IS THAT IT WAS.

891
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,708
>> I KNOW BUT MALICE SAY PRETTY
HEFTY CLAIM.

892
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:14,542
AND THERE'S NO MALICE THERE.

893
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,252
>> OKAY.

894
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,587
I DON'T TREAT PEOPLE THAT WAY.

895
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,381
AND--
>> I DON'T TREAT PEOPLE THAT

896
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:20,756
WAY.

897
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,049
>> I CAN TALK?

898
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,593
>> YES, I'M JUST-- I DON'T WANT
YOU TO PAINT ME AS SOMETHING I'M

899
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:25,219
NOT.

900
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:26,220
>> JUDGE DON'T YOU GO AHEAD.

901
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:27,596
>> Jeff: THAT IS AN IRONIC
STATEMENT.

902
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:27,888
>> I KNOW.

903
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,684
I KNOW.

904
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:40,234
>> UM... YOU KNOW, I'M JUST
THANKFUL THAT I GOT TO KNOW ZEKE

905
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:41,861
FOR WHO ZEKE IS.

906
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:44,447
I'VE BEEN WITH HIM FOR LAST 18
DAYS.

907
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:48,784
AND HE'S, LIKE, SUPER KICK-ASS.

908
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,578
AND, YOU KNOW, I'M FROM THE
MIDWEST.

909
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:54,582
I COME FROM A VERY CONSERVATIVE
BACKGROUND.

910
00:38:54,665 --> 00:39:01,756
SO IT'S NOT VERY DIVERSE WHEN IT
COMES TO A LOT OF GAY AND

911
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,550
LESBIAN AND TRANSGENDER AND
THINGS LIKE THAT.

912
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:09,930
SO I'M NOT EXPOSED TO IT AS MUCH
AS MOST OF THESE PEOPLE ARE.

913
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:15,770
AND THE FACT THAT I CAN LOVE
THIS GUY SO MUCH AND IT DOESN'T

914
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:23,527
CHANGE ANYTHING FOR ME MAKES ME
REALIZE THAT I'VE GROWN HUGE AS

915
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,905
A PERSON.

916
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:29,992
, OF COURSE, WE WANT TO COME
AWAY WITH WITH THE MILLION

917
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:33,662
DOLLARS, BUT THE METAMORPHOSIS
THAT I'VE EVEN MADE AS A PERSON

918
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:38,125
THEY DIDN'T REALIZE UNTIL THIS
MINUTE IS INVALUABLE.

919
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:42,129
AND I'M SORRY IT CAME OUT THAT
WAY, BUT I'M GLAD IT DID.

920
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:46,801
AND, LIKE, I'M SO GLAD THAT I
GOT TO KNOW YOU FOR ZEKE AND

921
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:50,805
NOT, YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU WERE
AFRAID OF US KNOWING YOU AS.

922
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,598
AND I'LL NEVER LOOK AT YOU THAT
WAY.

923
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:57,311
>> THANK YOU.

924
00:39:57,394 --> 00:40:01,273
>> YOU KNOW, JEFF, I'M CERTAINLY
NOT ANYONE WHO SHOULD BE A ROLE

925
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,985
MODEL FOR ANYBODY ELSE, BUT
MAYBE THERE'S SOMEONE WHO IS A

926
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:09,365
"SURVIVOR" FAN AND ME BEING OUT
ON THE SHOW HELPS HIM OR HELPS

927
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,117
HER OR HELPS SOMEONE ELSE.

928
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:18,332
AND SO MAYBE THIS WILL LEAD TO A
GREATER GOOD.

929
00:40:18,415 --> 00:40:21,085
>> Jeff: WELL, I THINK I KNOW
THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION, BUT

930
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,711
THERE'S NO QUESTION WHO'S GOING
HOME TONIGHT, RIGHT?

931
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,673
>> NO, SURE.

932
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:26,173
>> Jeff: ZEKE?

933
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,008
>> NO.

934
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,009
>> Jeff: DEBBIE?

935
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:29,635
>> NO.

936
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:32,221
>> TAI, OZZY, ANDREA?

937
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:32,680
>> NO.

938
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,013
>> IT'S VARNER.

939
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,849
>> IT IS.

940
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,517
>> I'M READY TO GO.

941
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,644
>> Jeff: WE DON'T NEED TO
VOTE.

942
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:48,696
JUST GRAB YOUR TORCH.

943
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:56,537
JUST GRAB YOUR TORCH.

944
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:11,385
>> Jeff: VARNER, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

945
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:15,514
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

946
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,198
>> Jeff: WELL, TONIGHT WAS A
COMPLICATED BUT ULTIMATELY

947
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:35,868
BEAUTIFUL NIGHT THAT WILL NEVER
BE FORGOTTEN.

948
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,494
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

949
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,412
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

950
00:41:38,495 --> 00:41:44,376
GOOD NIGHT.

WHEN 13 GAME CHANGERS COME
TOGETHER.

957

... WE ARE OFFICIALLY MERGE.

958

POWER.

961
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,745
>> IT'S JUST LIKE PEOPLE ARE
EVERYWHERE.

962

>> I'M READY TO GO IN GUNS
BLATION.

963
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,668
>> I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I WAS
THINKING.

964
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,628
IT WAS A HORRIBLE MOVE.

965
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,964
IT WAS ME WRAPPED UP IN THIS
GAME TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING I

966
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,173
POSSIBLY COULD.

967
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:35,177
BUT NOBODY ON THIS PLANET SHOULD
DO WHAT I DID TONIGHT, EVER.

968
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:39,265
AND I'M SO SORRY TO ANYONE I
OFFENDED, ESPECIALLY ZEKE AND

969
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:39,974
HIS FAMILY AND HIS FRIENDS.

970
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:40,975
I CAN'T EVEN TALK.

971
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,977
I'M SORRY.
