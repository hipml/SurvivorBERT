1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:03,586
>> JEFF PROBST: In a totally

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,882
unpredictable season...

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,092
only one thing was certain.

4
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:10,093
>> He's threatening Russell

5
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,177
Hantz.

6
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,595
When you do that, you go.

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,763
>> PROBST: Anyone who targeted

8
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:14,764
Russell...

9
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,765
>> Watch your back, man.

10
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:16,307
>> Same thing for you, man.

11
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,143
>> PROBST: ...found themselves

12
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:19,227
blindsided instead.

13
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,480
Tyson, Boston Rob, Coach,

14
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:23,815
Courtney.

15
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,233
The tribe has spoken.

16
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:26,192
He achieved his goals with lies

17
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,193
and deception.

18
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:32,240
>> This is where I stand.

19
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:34,659
Hook, line, and sinker.

20
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:35,952
>> PROBST: The only person to

21
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:37,036
cross Russell and still

22
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,037
survive...

23
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:38,496
>> Yeah, I trust you.

24
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,164
>> PROBST: ...was Sandra.

25
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,165
>> But whatever Russell says,

26
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:41,166
he's lying.

27
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,208
>> PROBST: Behind his back, she

28
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,251
convinced the Heroes to join

29
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:45,295
forces with her and take him

30
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,296
out.

31
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,297
>> You want Russell gone?

32
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,548
>> Yeah.

33
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:49,549
>> Russell's gone.

34
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:50,133
>> PROBST: But Candice saw an

35
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,177
opportunity to further her own

36
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,512
game and joined up with Russell,

37
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,639
warning him he was in trouble.

38
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,267
>> Mm-hmm.

39
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,351
>> PROBST: With her plans

40
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,394
betrayed, Sandra was forced to

41
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,896
rejoin the Villains.

42
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:03,938
>> You're saying you're going to

43
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:04,939
vote for me?

44
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,274
>> No, nobody's going to vote

45
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,317
for you.

46
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,401
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council, a

47
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,152
frightened Russell played the

48
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,821
hidden immunity idol.

49
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:12,822
>> Russell's super-paranoid, and

50
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,323
that is going to be his

51
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,157
downfall.

52
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,116
>> PROBST: Russell wasted his

53
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,911
idol because both Candice and

54
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:18,912
Sandra voted with the

55
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,121
Villains...

56
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:23,666
Amanda, the tribe has spoken.

57
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,751
...leaving the Heroes in their

58
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,336
toughest position so far.

59
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,379
What they don't know is that

60
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,756
tonight, there will be two

61
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:33,343
immunity challenges, two Tribal

62
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,012
Councils, and two more survivors

63
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:39,140
will meet their fate.

64
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,440
>> Tribal Council is

65
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,650
interesting.

66
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:49,943
Candice-- she helped us out, in

67
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,152
that one vote, gets some

68
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:54,656
numbers, and now she's a threat.

69
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:55,281
Someone who flips over that

70
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,867
quickly to our side will just as

71
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,244
easily flip-flop back, so we

72
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:04,666
don't really need her anymore.

73
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,271
>> Candice was a pitiful player,

74
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,648
and she just proved it to me

75
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:29,274
tonight.

76
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,317
She deserved to be on the

77
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,861
Villains' tribe.

78
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,279
Colby and I are standing out on

79
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,906
a sinking ship now.

80
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,243
There are no other Heroes.

81
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,299
(bird squawking)

82
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:57,510
(squeaking)

83
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,433
>> It's going to be fun from

84
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,560
now on.

85
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,105
>> Nah. Just-Just Rupert and

86
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,148
Colby's not talking to me.

87
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,149
>> Oh. Oh...

88
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,192
>> Their feelings are hurt.

89
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,652
I mean, what game do they think

90
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,653
they're playing?

91
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,656
You know what I mean?

92
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,241
>> I think Russell is a

93
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,076
deceitful person, and anything

94
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,245
he says is a lie.

95
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,873
He could be worse than Jonny

96
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:27,874
Fairplay.

97
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,876
He is.

98
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:30,418
With all that building up

99
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,962
inside of me, I have to say

100
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,380
something this morning to

101
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,423
Russell.

102
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,341
My only hope is to show the

103
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:43,056
Villains that disgusting side

104
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,891
and ask them, truly, do they

105
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,560
want to be involved in that?

106
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,896
I'll tell you what, man.

107
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,439
You've already proven yourself

108
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:53,149
to be a disgusting, terrible

109
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:55,234
human being to swear on your

110
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,195
kids' life.

111
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,238
>> Well, you know what, Rupe?

112
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,532
It is the game, and you really

113
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,533
... for yourself.

114
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,326
>> If you want to swear on your

115
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,787
kids' life and call it the game,

116
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,788
that's fine.

117
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:07,872
I've played the game twice.

118
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,123
People see, I'm not that liar.

119
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,416
>> Do you think I care about how

120
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,960
I ... look to you as a man?

121
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:12,585
>> I think you don't give a damn

122
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,503
about anything but yourself.

123
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,588
>> I don't give a ... about you

124
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,589
or your family.

125
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:17,924
>> I know. I don't think you

126
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,175
give a damn about anybody but

127
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:20,218
yourself, and your team should

128
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,219
know that.

129
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,220
>> Rupert, I'm a villain.

130
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,931
I'm here so I just can make your

131
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,057
life hell.

132
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,892
The great powerful Rupert, the

133
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:28,893
good guy.

134
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:29,936
>> You know, you can say...

135
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,062
>> The second coming of Christ--

136
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,063
Rupert.

137
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,106
>> You can say whatever you

138
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,274
want, because it doesn't really

139
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,525
matter anymore.

140
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,526
(Russell laughs)

141
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,568
>> You're such a dumb ass,

142
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,696
Rupert.

143
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,405
I don't want Rupert here because

144
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,865
Rupert's sitting there, trying

145
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:43,491
to stir up stuff, trying to make

146
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,450
me mad.

147
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,703
I'm just telling him, "Pack

148
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,787
your stuff, partner.

149
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,788
Pack your stuff.

150
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:49,956
Get your tie-dye ready 'cause

151
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,376
you're going home."

152
00:04:55,545 --> 00:05:03,386
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

153
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,345
Guys ready to get to today's

154
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,346
challenge?

155
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,347
>> Yes.

156
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,391
>> PROBST: Today, you are not

157
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,559
playing for reward.

158
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,060
You're playing for immunity.

159
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:11,644
One of you going home tonight

160
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,353
at Tribal Council.

161
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,354
>> Oh!

162
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,355
>> PROBST: First things first,

163
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,356
Jerri.

164
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,984
You know I got to take it back.

165
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:23,031
>> It was fun while it lasted.

166
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,198
>> PROBST: Once again, immunity

167
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:24,657
is back up for grabs.

168
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,826
For today's challenge, you will

169
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,078
be standing barefoot on a small

170
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,747
wooden perch with your arm

171
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,414
raised about your head.

172
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,916
Your hand will be tethered to a

173
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,001
bucket.

174
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:35,626
When your hand drops, the bucket

175
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,544
tips, you're out of the

176
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,172
challenge.

177
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,174
Last person left standing wins

178
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,300
immunity.

179
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,760
To make it interesting, I will

180
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,054
tempt you by offering you food

181
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:46,471
items.

182
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,681
One other thing-- a twist which

183
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,475
will be revealed at the end of

184
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:53,102
this challenge.

185
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:53,561
Take your positions.

186
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:57,690
We'll get started.

187
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,108
All right, this challenge is

188
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,320
underway.

189
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,240
Rupert competed in a variation

190
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,825
of this challenge.

191
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,118
Lasted a couple of hours.

192
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,745
Parvati won this challenge in

193
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:11,412
<i>Fans vs. Favorites,</i> lasting

194
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,082
over six hours.

195
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,583
But there's one difference-- the

196
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,419
perch you're on today is a new

197
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:18,669
addition.

198
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,715
It makes it a little tougher.

199
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,763
All right, are you guys ready to

200
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,890
be tempted?

201
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,601
>> I want it, Jeff.

202
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,602
>> PROBST: You want out?

203
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:35,436
You don't even know what it is.

204
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,437
>> I don't care.

205
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,231
Whatever it is, I want it.

206
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,107
>> I want it, too, Jeff.

207
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,108
>> PROBST: So, wait.

208
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:40,983
Sandra and Russell, you both

209
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:41,984
want it without seeing?

210
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:42,985
>> Yup.

211
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:43,986
>> Yeah, I don't care what it

212
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,987
is.

213
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:45,988
>> PROBST: Step down then.

214
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:46,989
>> For real?

215
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:47,990
>> PROBST: Step down.

216
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:48,991
>> Oh!

217
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,328
>> PROBST: Sandra and Russell,

218
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,621
one minute into a challenge on

219
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,581
day 31, with immunity on the

220
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,417
line, voluntarily step out of

221
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,502
the challenge for an unknown

222
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,670
item.

223
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,629
>> I don't care.

224
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:02,630
>> PROBST: Here's what you're

225
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:03,631
sharing.

226
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:04,632
>> Yes!

227
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:05,633
>> Oh, my God.

228
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:06,634
>> What is it?

229
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:07,635
>> PROBST: Cookies and milk.

230
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:08,636
Oatmeal raisin, chocolate chip.

231
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:09,637
>> Oh, my God!

232
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,305
>> Oh!

233
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,765
Oh, these cookies are off the

234
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:13,766
hook.

235
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,351
You guys don't know what you're

236
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:16,352
missing.

237
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:17,937
>> PROBST: Down to six, just

238
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,023
like that.

239
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,617
>> Uh-oh.

240
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,327
He's back.

241
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,663
>> PROBST: Next item.

242
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:36,664
>> Donuts!

243
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:37,665
>> Oh, my God!

244
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:38,791
>> PROBST: Four donuts and an

245
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,792
iced coffee.

246
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,043
>> Damn!

247
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,044
>> Oh!

248
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,462
>> PROBST: I'll give you guys 30

249
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,046
seconds to think about this

250
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,923
before I give them to Sandra and

251
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:46,924
Russell.

252
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:47,925
>> What?

253
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:48,926
(Sandra laughs and mumbles)

254
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,136
>> All right, I'll take it,

255
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,137
Jeff.

256
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,138
>> PROBST: Colby wants it.

257
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,472
Anybody else want in?

258
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,558
Drop out, Donaldson.

259
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,601
Rise to avoid the green.

260
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:57,602
>> Oh.

261
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:58,603
>> Ninja Turtle style.

262
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,272
>> PROBST: All yours, brother.

263
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,273
>> Thanks.

264
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,608
>> PROBST: We are down to five

265
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,650
people left in this challenge.

266
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,778
(Jerri exhales loudly)

267
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,138
>> PROBST: I have another item.

268
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,848
Let's see if I can get somebody

269
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,266
else to give up immunity.

270
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,267
>> Oh.

271
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,268
>> Oh, my God.

272
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,269
>> What is it?

273
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,270
>> Peanut butter and jelly?

274
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,271
>> PROBST: Peanut butter and

275
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,314
jelly sandwiches, chips, a big

276
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,315
bowl of candy.

277
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,316
>> Oh, my God.

278
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,359
>> PROBST: Two glass of milk.

279
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,360
>> Oh.

280
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:47,944
>> I think I'm gonna take this

281
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:48,653
one.

282
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,695
>> I want to take it.

283
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,696
>> I'll take it.

284
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,697
>> I'll wait.

285
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,698
>> PROBST: So Danielle, Candice

286
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,783
and Jerri are all coming down

287
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,784
to share this.

288
00:08:54,867 --> 00:09:01,457
Step off.

289
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,543
>> Oh.

290
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,126
>> Your pants just came off.

291
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:04,585
>> I hate you bitches.

292
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,628
(laughing)

293
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,587
>> PROBST: Peanut butter and

294
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,965
jelly sandwiches, chips, big

295
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,258
bowl of candy, two glasses of

296
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,259
milk.

297
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,260
How is it, ladies?

298
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,302
>> Best sandwich I ever had.

299
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,303
>> Mm-hmm.

300
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,846
>> PROBST: And just like that,

301
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,057
we are down to two.

302
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,725
Parvati on one end, Rupert on

303
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,435
the other.

304
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,980
Both fighting for immunity.

305
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,191
We could be here a long time.

306
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:41,038
>> PROBST: Been out here over an

307
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,750
hour.

308
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:57,888
>> Ooh ...

309
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,515
>> There he goes.

310
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:00,891
>> Damn it!

311
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,393
>> PROBST: Rupert drops out of

312
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,436
the challenge.

313
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,437
Parvati wins immunity.

314
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,438
>> Oh.

315
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,439
>> Girl, congratulations.

316
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,440
>> Good job, Parvati.

317
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,441
>> Good work, Rupert.

318
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,442
>> PROBST: What happened,

319
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,443
Rupert?

320
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,444
>> Slipped. (scoffs)

321
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,404
I could have made it hours.

322
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:13,863
So I go home tonight.

323
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,657
Done.

324
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,658
>> PROBST: Parvati,

325
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:18,034
congratulations.

326
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:18,868
>> Thank you, Jeff.

327
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,745
>> PROBST: This challenge likes

328
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:21,746
you, and you like it.

329
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:22,747
>> Yay, Parvati.

330
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,789
>> I love this challenge.

331
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:24,832
>> PROBST: Parvati wins this

332
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,043
challenge once again.

333
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,127
Parvati is safe at tonight's

334
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:28,711
Tribal Council, guaranteed a

335
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,547
one-in-seven shot at winning

336
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,216
this game for the second time.

337
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,344
All right, guys, now to the

338
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:36,927
twist I mentioned at the start

339
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,804
of this challenge.

340
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:39,722
This is a clue to a hidden

341
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,766
immunity idol at your camp.

342
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:45,436
"All hope is not lost if you

343
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,646
suffer defeat.

344
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,357
Salvation is hidden where two

345
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,859
paths meet.

346
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,986
A burning bush throws a shadow

347
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,281
on top of a stone under which

348
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,534
lies the key to not going home."

349
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,328
Have a fun afternoon.

350
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,621
I will see you tonight at

351
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,873
Tribal Council.

352
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,387
>> At the challenge, Jeff read

353
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,721
a clue to the immunity idol.

354
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:24,141
So the minute we get to camp,

355
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,601
all of a sudden, people just

356
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:26,644
started running.

357
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:27,728
>> We're gonna have to split up.

358
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,146
Y'all go on that one.

359
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,231
>> Parvati!

360
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:30,815
>> The clue said, there'll

361
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,943
be a burning bush, and in the

362
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:34,860
shadow there'll be the immunity

363
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,612
idol.

364
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:37,113
Is this a burning bush?

365
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,781
>> It's red, isn't it?

366
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,950
>> I thought it meant, like, a

367
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,159
bush that's on fire.

368
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,411
>> There's no bush on fire.

369
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:43,953
>> What the hell's a burning

370
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,329
bush?

371
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,622
>> What is this thing?

372
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:47,498
>> A dead tree.

373
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,625
>> It's just a dead tree.

374
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,087
>> Candice and Russell start

375
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,839
digging where there's this big

376
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:55,923
red bush.

377
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,258
But across from there, there's

378
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,592
another big red bush, so I

379
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,261
start digging...

380
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,471
and I see it.

381
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,814
Let me see what it says.

382
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,941
I can't believe I finally found

383
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:14,817
something.

384
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,070
Um...

385
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,738
I'm nervous-- I can't read this

386
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:20,698
out here.

387
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,408
I don't know where to put this.

388
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,453
It's too big.

389
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,997
Oh, no, it's too bulgy.

390
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,424
>> You think it's on these

391
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:38,841
trails?

392
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,009
>> Well, I mean, these aren't

393
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,844
really trails, right?

394
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,180
>> Even though I don't have the

395
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,891
idol, maybe I can play like I

396
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:50,686
do.

397
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,980
I stuck me a rock in my pocket,

398
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,316
making it look a little dangly,

399
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,484
a little big.

400
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,026
This isn't my first game of

401
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,903
<i>Survivor.</i>

402
00:12:58,986 --> 00:12:59,904
I'm just trying to stay in it

403
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:03,949
another day.

404
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,076
>> What's happening, Rupe?

405
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,703
Feel like we're Easter egg

406
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,121
huntin'.

407
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,957
>> Yeah.

408
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,959
>> I have a lot of experience

409
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:14,919
with idols.

410
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,795
Rupert has a big, bulky thing

411
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,797
in his pocket.

412
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,633
It's the idol wrapped up in the

413
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:21,759
paper.

414
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,427
Now, we have to get rid of the

415
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,221
idol, so how are we going to do

416
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:25,846
this?

417
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,388
It's easy-- we'll split the

418
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,848
votes tonight.

419
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,517
If he don't play it, he goes

420
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,184
home.

421
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,352
That's how we'll do it.

422
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,394
>> I don't know, I think

423
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:32,978
everybody pretty much gave up.

424
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,688
>> He found it.

425
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,189
I see it in his pocket.

426
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,233
I know exactly how they look.

427
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,651
And I know exactly how they

428
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,778
look in a pocket.

429
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:45,324
>> Russell swears that Rupert

430
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,784
found the idol.

431
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,118
Of course, I know that's a lie,

432
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,161
'cause I have the freakin'

433
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:49,995
immunity idol.

434
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,705
And if they think Rupert has

435
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,749
it, that's good for Sandra.

436
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:56,877
So I'm not going to say nothing.

437
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,800
>> No, we'll split the votes,

438
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:03,634
three-three.

439
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:04,635
>> Why?

440
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:05,177
>> To get the idol out of

441
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,095
Rupert's hands.

442
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,972
>> We have to flush it out.

443
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:08,973
>> Oh, right.

444
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,349
>> So we have to split the

445
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,476
votes.

446
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:20,943
>> (whispers): It's perfect.

447
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,529
>> Colby and Candice are both

448
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,572
threats in different ways.

449
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,574
That's why it's a hard decision.

450
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,950
Candice voted with us to vote

451
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,827
out Amanda, and I really think

452
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,911
she's going to stay loyal to us.

453
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,663
Colby's not really doing any

454
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,914
kind of strategizing, so I feel

455
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,458
like I can get him to do

456
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,001
whatever.

457
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,627
I don't know, I mean, either

458
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,212
way, we're rolling the dice.

459
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,130
>> Right now we need to be safe

460
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,549
and make sure that idol is out

461
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,883
of Rupert's hands.

462
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:48,012
>> Yeah.

463
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,597
>> Here's how it's gonna work.

464
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,139
They're going to split the

465
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,016
votes tonight, 'cause they

466
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,142
got six of them, right?

467
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,643
So they're going to send half

468
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,269
of them your way, and the other

469
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,062
half are either going to go

470
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,439
towards me or towards Candice.

471
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,815
>> If three of them vote for

472
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:00,399
Candice, then you and I vote

473
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,192
for Candice, there's five votes

474
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,736
for Candice.

475
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:04,320
>> And even if three of them

476
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,322
vote for you and you don't have

477
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,573
the idol, you're still safe.

478
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,574
>> There's still five votes for

479
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:09,033
Candice.

480
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,784
>> Exactly. I could be going

481
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:11,327
home tonight if it doesn't

482
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,412
work, but if it does, me and

483
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,872
you get to vote Candice out.

484
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,207
>> Oh, God! That would be...

485
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,667
>> And then we've still got a

486
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:29,970
shot.

487
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,930
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

488
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,767
the members of our jury.

489
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,976
Coach... Courtney...

490
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,396
J.T., and Amanda, voted out at

491
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,275
the last Tribal Council.

492
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,193
All right, Rupert, let's pick

493
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,195
up with the last Tribal Council.

494
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,988
Amanda's voted out.

495
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,114
You all go back to camp.

496
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,324
What's the fallout?

497
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,368
>> The fallout was, we realized

498
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,244
there's only two Heroes left.

499
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,330
There's Colby and I.

500
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,915
Candice jumped to the Villains'

501
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:58,749
side.

502
00:15:58,832 --> 00:15:59,792
>> PROBST: Candice, you're

503
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:00,459
shaking your head.

504
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,669
Is that not true?

505
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,879
>> It was obvious that Amanda

506
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:05,464
was going to go home whether I

507
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,049
voted for her or not.

508
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,467
You know, Amanda had a target

509
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,718
on her back because she's a

510
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,637
strong, strategic player.

511
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,013
So it wasn't like my vote was

512
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,431
the nail in the coffin to send

513
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,557
her home.

514
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,685
The numbers were already there.

515
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,227
>> I have no respect for the

516
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,020
excuses.

517
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,146
>> It's not going to get me any

518
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,564
further in the game to go down

519
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,440
on a sinking ship.

520
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,441
>> Well, then that's what you

521
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,359
should have said, that right

522
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,318
there.

523
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,319
>> Exactly right.

524
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,529
>> "This is a game for a

525
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,571
million dollars.

526
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,907
This was my best play."

527
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,449
>> PROBST: So, Russell, as a

528
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,660
strategy, Candice put herself

529
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,120
ahead of Colby and Rupert, and

530
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,621
that will keep her in the game

531
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,414
longer.

532
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,581
Good move.

533
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,667
>> Yeah, it's her best move.

534
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,877
She goes to the Villains' side

535
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,462
at number six, and unless

536
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,505
you're going to give all the

537
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,715
Villains a million dollars,

538
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:48,298
something has to break within

539
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,134
the Villains-- so she could have

540
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,177
made a great move.

541
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,595
>> PROBST: So if history

542
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,389
repeats, now we're looking at

543
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,141
Rupert or Colby in trouble

544
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,142
tonight.

545
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,185
>> What am I supposed to say?

546
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,395
I'm going to get rid of my

547
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,230
Villain partners out here?

548
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,732
No, that ain't gonna happen.

549
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:05,315
We got two Heroes that's gonna

550
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,568
have to go sooner or later, and

551
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,111
the consensus is that Rupert

552
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,488
goes, so...

553
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,948
>> PROBST: Rupert, after the

554
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:13,490
challenge was over, I read a

555
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,744
clue where another idol was

556
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:17,369
hidden.

557
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,704
You get back to camp-- what

558
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:19,913
happens?

559
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:20,414
>> We got home from our

560
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,957
challenge.

561
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,126
I calmly took my sandals off and

562
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,086
went for a walk in the jungle

563
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,464
and stayed until I felt

564
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,256
comfortable.

565
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,591
>> PROBST: So, Russell, you

566
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,009
think that idol's out there, or

567
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,385
do you think Colby or Rupert has

568
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,970
the idol?

569
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:36,930
>> If they don't, then they

570
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,475
gave up.

571
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,018
And I don't think Colby or

572
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:44,897
Rupert would give up.

573
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,939
>> PROBST: All right, let's get

574
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:46,774
to the vote.

575
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:47,691
Parvati has the immunity

576
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,150
necklace.

577
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,109
Cannot vote for Parvati.

578
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,277
Everybody else is fair game.

579
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,404
Colby, you're up.

580
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,203
>> I can honestly say I'm proud

581
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,330
of the way I played this game.

582
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,208
Can you?

583
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,474
>> My mom always told me, if you

584
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,017
don't have something nice to

585
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,103
say, don't say anything at all.

586
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:45,541
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

587
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,376
votes.

588
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,554
If anybody has the hidden

589
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,930
immunity idol and you want to

590
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,390
play it, now would be the time

591
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,517
to do so.

592
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,163
Okay, once the votes are read,

593
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:24,955
the decision is final.

594
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:25,539
The person voted out will be

595
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,206
asked to leave the Tribal

596
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,249
Council area immediately.

597
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,376
I'll read the votes.

598
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,550
First vote...

599
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:47,936
>> PROBST: Once the votes are

600
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,520
read, the decision is final.

601
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,313
The person voted out will be

602
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,355
asked to leave the Tribal

603
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,316
Council area immediately.

604
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:55,235
I'll read the votes.

605
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,989
First vote...

606
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,241
Rupert.

607
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,951
Rupert.

608
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,580
That's two votes Rupert.

609
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:06,788
Rupert.

610
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:11,501
That's three votes Rupert.

611
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,544
Candice.

612
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:17,090
One vote Candice.

613
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:17,633
Candice.

614
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,134
That's three votes Rupert, two

615
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:23,013
votes Candice.

616
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,222
Candice.

617
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,515
We're tied, three votes Rupert,

618
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:30,145
three votes Candice.

619
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:31,396
That's four votes Candice,

620
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,982
three votes Rupert, one vote

621
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,109
left.

622
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,988
13th person voted out and the

623
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,490
fifth member of our jury...

624
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,532
Candice.

625
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:45,661
You need to bring me your torch.

626
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,960
Candice, the tribe has spoken.

627
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,294
>> Thank you.

628
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,504
Good luck, you guys.

629
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,632
>> PROBST: Time for you to go.

630
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,387
Well, maybe the lesson learned

631
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,223
from<i> tonight's</i> Tribal Council is

632
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,516
this-- it's a risky move when

633
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,602
you betray trust in order to

634
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,353
gain trust.

635
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,063
Grab your torches.

636
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,106
Head back to camp.

637
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,233
Good night.

638
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,239
>> I definitely got thrown under

639
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,323
the bus tonight, um, but I

640
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,409
understand I made a risky move

641
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:29,496
yesterday, and, um, it didn't

642
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,123
pay off.

643
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,542
So I guess... karma's a bitch

644
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,669
sometimes.

645
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:50,684
>> Wow.

646
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,144
>> We just blew it.

647
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:52,728
We were supposed to split the

648
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,479
votes for Rupert and Colby, and

649
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,940
it didn't happen.

650
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:57,524
It was a terrible decision.

651
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,443
The girls got their heart

652
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,986
involved in the game, wanted

653
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,320
Candice out of here because

654
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:02,821
they didn't like her, so

655
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,531
everybody blew it.

656
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:05,574
And I'm one of them.

657
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,409
I should have sat them down and

658
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,410
said, "No, this is what we're

659
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,537
gonna do."

660
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,666
From the get-go.

661
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,134
...one at a...

662
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,261
Just Rupert alone.

663
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:34,436
>> I'm not fully in control of

664
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,354
this game now.

665
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,315
Me and Parvati are equally in

666
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:39,566
control, and that makes me a

667
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,110
little worried.

668
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,111
But you know what?

669
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:43,653
I'm going to take control of

670
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,947
this game so fast, they ain't

671
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:49,076
even know what hit them.

672
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:04,716
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

673
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,009
Guys ready to get to today's

674
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,010
immunity challenge?

675
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,011
>> Yes.

676
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,012
>> Yeah.

677
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,013
>> PROBST: First things first.

678
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,056
Parvati, it looks like you're

679
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,683
ready to give it up.

680
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,018
Once again, immunity is back up

681
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,520
for grabs.

682
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,438
For today's challenge, you will

683
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,357
each race to get a peg that you

684
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,733
will use to maneuver through a

685
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,026
table maze.

686
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,444
The first five to finish move on

687
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,072
to the next round, where you

688
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,073
will use four

689
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:28,698
individually-shaped pegs to help

690
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,534
you get to the top of a tall

691
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,494
climbing wall.

692
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,079
The first three to get to the

693
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,664
top of the wall move on to the

694
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:36,957
final round, where you must

695
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,541
solve a slide puzzle.

696
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,377
The first person to finish the

697
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,129
puzzle wins immunity and is

698
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,464
guaranteed a one-in-six shot at

699
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,675
winning this game and the

700
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,010
million-dollar check.

701
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:49,594
Losers, Tribal Council, where

702
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,347
after 33 days, somebody will be

703
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,306
sent home.

704
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,641
We'll draw for spots, we'll

705
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:57,769
get started.

706
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:01,648
Here we go.

707
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:02,649
First round.

708
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,192
Survivors ready?

709
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:09,197
Go!

710
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,032
You've got to dig up your peg

711
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,450
and then get it through the

712
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,202
table maze.

713
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,829
Rupert has his, and he's off to

714
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:19,958
a fast start.

715
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,630
Parvati, Sandra, Danielle have

716
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:26,798
theirs.

717
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,301
Russell's got his.

718
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,178
Jerri has her peg.

719
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,847
Everybody on the maze but Colby.

720
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,682
Colby now has his peg and a lot

721
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:38,852
of time to make up.

722
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,481
Rupert was out very quickly.

723
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,816
Russell now doing a good job on

724
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,276
the maze.

725
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,153
Rupert very close.

726
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,155
Sandra getting close.

727
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,198
Rupert's through.

728
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:55,243
Rupert moving on.

729
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,244
Sandra moving on.

730
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,663
>> I can't believe it.

731
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,707
>> PROBST: Russell's moving on.

732
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,543
Parvati moving on.

733
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,837
One spot left.

734
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:06,671
Three people vying for it.

735
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,633
Jerri, Danielle and Colby.

736
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,593
Danielle very close.

737
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:15,722
Danielle moving on.

738
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,100
Moving on to the next round.

739
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,353
It's Rupert, Sandra, Parvati,

740
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,812
Danielle and Russell.

741
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,481
First three to the top of the

742
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:25,857
wall move on.

743
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,735
Survivors ready?

744
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,111
Go!

745
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,113
You have four pegs.

746
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,365
Use them as you want.

747
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,783
You don't have to use any of

748
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,911
them.

749
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,788
Russell gets himself halfway up

750
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:40,830
the wall by just running.

751
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,123
Rupert trying to run up the

752
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,124
wall.

753
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,542
You're going to have to run

754
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:45,543
harder than that.

755
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,169
Meanwhile, Parvati is moving up

756
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,712
the wall.

757
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:51,132
Danielle making steady progress.

758
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,801
Russell climbing up this wall.

759
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,887
Using only two pegs so far.

760
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,807
Russell very close to the top.

761
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,517
Russell to the top.

762
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,518
Russell's moving on.

763
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,103
Two more spots.

764
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,604
Rupert making up for lost time.

765
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:09,067
Parvati very close.

766
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,527
Rupert to the top.

767
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,528
He moves on.

768
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:11,987
Parvati to the top.

769
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,737
She moves on.

770
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,948
It is Russell, Parvati and

771
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,616
Rupert in the final round for

772
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,617
immunity.

773
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,702
>> Damn!

774
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,662
>> Now how do I get down?

775
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:21,705
>> PROBST: All right, here we

776
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:22,706
go.

777
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,624
The final round.

778
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,959
For immunity.

779
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,043
Survivors ready?

780
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,628
Go!

781
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,088
It's a slide puzzle.

782
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,381
That means you can't pick up

783
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,382
the pieces.

784
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,342
You have to slide them around,

785
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,094
building that very familiar

786
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,888
<i>Survivor</i> logo.

787
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:39,889
Don't slow down.

788
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,474
Don't lose your concentration.

789
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:45,228
Focus on finishing this puzzle.

790
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,521
Russell starting to get it

791
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:48,648
together a little bit.

792
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,027
>> PROBST: Rupert's now starting

793
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,069
to come together with his

794
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,405
puzzle.

795
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,824
Parvati falling out of it.

796
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,659
Russell much closer now.

797
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:00,660
Rupert very close.

798
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:06,791
We are neck and neck.

799
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:07,792
>> Jeff.

800
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:08,835
>> PROBST: Russell thinks he has

801
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:09,836
it.

802
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:10,837
Russell wins immunity!

803
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,838
>> Way to go, Russell!

804
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,966
>> Good job, Russell!

805
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,138
>> PROBST: Russell, come on

806
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,139
over.

807
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,349
>> Good job, Russell.

808
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:22,974
>> PROBST: Russell safe tonight

809
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,768
at Tribal Council.

810
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:27,604
For the rest of you, after 33

811
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:28,605
hard-fought days, somebody

812
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:29,606
going home tonight.

813
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:30,231
Grab your stuff, head back to

814
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:30,899
camp.

815
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,692
I'll see you at Tribal.

816
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,903
Congrats.

817
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,321
>> I was thinking as I walked

818
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,573
out of that darn challenge, "You

819
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:40,033
made it so far, and still came

820
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,535
up short."

821
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,871
I have to believe in myself,

822
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,748
because just the lie of a rock

823
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:47,916
in your pocket is not going to

824
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:56,883
save you tonight.

825
00:27:56,966 --> 00:28:00,011
(thunder crackling)

826
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:11,940
>> I want Rupert to go home

827
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:12,941
tonight.

828
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,527
He's a Hero.

829
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,070
He is not part of our original

830
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,738
tribe of Villains.

831
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,156
And I'm pretty sure Rupert does

832
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,157
not have the idol.

833
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,742
So, yeah, I don't feel bad for

834
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,160
Rupert at all.

835
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:24,828
I think he's kind of dug his

836
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,247
own grave.

837
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,832
The Villain invasion happened,

838
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,208
and now the Villains are running

839
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:30,917
this place.

840
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,253
There ain't gonna be any Heroes

841
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:34,254
left.

842
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:37,507
No Heroes.

843
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:42,971
Seriously.

844
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,889
>> What do you mean locked

845
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:45,890
in...?

846
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:46,891
>> I mean, we need to be strong,

847
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:47,892
five, and get those two off,

848
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:48,893
because if those... one of those

849
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:49,894
guys makes it to the end, none

850
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:50,895
of us stand a chance.

851
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:51,938
It has to be five Villains...

852
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:52,897
>> Yeah, I know that.

853
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:53,898
>> ...and that's it.

854
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:54,774
>> I know that.

855
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,985
>> And honestly, right now,

856
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,027
we're set up pretty good,

857
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,070
because Rupert can go home,

858
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,113
Colby's not good in challenges,

859
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,114
and he can go home next, you

860
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,199
know?

861
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,451
>> Parvati and Danielle, to me,

862
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:05,702
they're a team, when it's

863
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,954
supposed to be me and Parvati.

864
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,038
And that's a problem.

865
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:09,998
So the only thing I can think of

866
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,459
right now is to break up that

867
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:17,755
couple.

868
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,756
>> You really think so?

869
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,757
>> Mm. I wouldn't take her to

870
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:20,758
the finals.

871
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:21,759
>> Oh.

872
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,344
>> She might try to get rid of

873
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,013
you or try to get rid of me.

874
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,055
Uh, that's going to come.

875
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,599
If she tries to get rid of

876
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:28,600
either of us, you know, we can

877
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:29,601
easily bounce out her.

878
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:30,894
>> Yeah.

879
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:31,936
>> Russell brought up that he

880
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,230
wants to get rid of Parvati, but

881
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,773
I don't know if we should do

882
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:35,982
that.

883
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:36,858
You know, Parvati's been my

884
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:37,859
alliance since the beginning,

885
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,195
and, like, if we are going to

886
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,571
ever do that-- which I don't

887
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,114
know if I am because I'm in a

888
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,407
tight alliance with her-- but if

889
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:44,991
we are, now is not the time.

890
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,034
I trust you, like, 110%.

891
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,035
I don't have any worries about

892
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,036
you.

893
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,038
>> Yeah, I trust you, too.

894
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,124
>> Danielle came to me.

895
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,792
She wants to vote you off when

896
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,377
it comes down to five or six.

897
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:56,961
>> Why would she want to do

898
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,838
that?

899
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,049
>> And I ain't messing with you,

900
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,050
Parvati.

901
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,051
You got to...

902
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,344
As... like I told you, my

903
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:05,970
loyalty lies with you in this

904
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,514
game, and that's it.

905
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:08,515
I'm working Danielle.

906
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,516
I'm working Parvati.

907
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,767
I'm telling Parvati we've got

908
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,809
to get rid of Danielle.

909
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:12,393
I'm telling Danielle we got

910
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:12,894
to get rid of Parvati.

911
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,021
So, by working both of them,

912
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,314
I got both of them under

913
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,315
control.

914
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,399
Parvati's not going to tell

915
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,817
Danielle, Danielle's not going

916
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,027
to tell Parvati, 'cause it'd

917
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,403
mess up both of their games.

918
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,864
>> Well, I want to talk to her.

919
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:25,865
>> Are you serious?

920
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:26,866
>> Yes, I'm serious.

921
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,867
>> About what?

922
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:30,286
>> You can't just come at me and

923
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,829
tell me that my final three from

924
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:32,830
day one wants me out.

925
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:33,831
>> Oh, my God.

926
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:34,415
>> And you think I'm not going

927
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:34,874
to talk to her?

928
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:35,875
>> You gonna talk to her?

929
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:36,876
>> I'm not going to tell her you

930
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,877
told me that, but...

931
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:38,878
>> She's going to know...

932
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:39,879
>> ...I'm gonna find out what

933
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:40,922
she's saying.

934
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:41,923
>> Parvati, if you do that,

935
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:42,924
you're out of this game.

936
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:43,925
I promise you.

937
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:44,884
Are you serious?

938
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,010
You're going to go tell her

939
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,011
exactly what I'm trying to keep

940
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,012
a secret from her?

941
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,013
>> I just told you, I'm not

942
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,014
going to say what you're saying.

943
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,100
>> You can't even bring it up.

944
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:52,392
Go ahead.

945
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,644
Do what you think you need to

946
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:55,103
do, Parvati.

947
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,522
>> Don't yell at me, Russell.

948
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:58,815
>> I can't believe you're,

949
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,650
you're thinking like this.

950
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:01,401
>> Thinking like what?

951
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:01,943
Like I want to have a ...

952
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,528
conversation with someone?

953
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,904
>> You can't go up to her and

954
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:05,530
say anything...

955
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,073
>> Don't tell me I can't have a

956
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,074
conversation with someone.

957
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:08,491
>> Okay, all right.

958
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,076
You go talk to her.

959
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:10,868
You do that.

960
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,370
>> Today should have been

961
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:12,704
Rupert: done.

962
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:13,997
Russell comes out of nowhere

963
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,914
and says, "They're blind-siding

964
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:15,873
"you.

965
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,875
That's what's happening."

966
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,294
I'm, like, "I'm not voting

967
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:19,669
"Danielle tonight.

968
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,754
"I don't care what you say.

969
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,048
I'm not doing it."

970
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,175
>> It<i> could</i> be dangerous if

971
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,011
Parvati<i> would</i> talk to Danielle

972
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,596
about what I told her that

973
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,888
Danielle wants to get rid

974
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:31,389
of Parvati.

975
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:37,770
It could turn into a problem.

976
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,147
>><i> She</i> wanted to blind-side you!

977
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,065
>> He said that to you?

978
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:41,316
>> Yes.

979
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,526
>> He told me that you came up

980
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,236
to him and said that you wanted

981
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,821
to blind-side me now

982
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:48,698
because, um, you don't think you

983
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:49,324
can win against me and, like,

984
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,074
all this other stuff.

985
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:50,992
>> He's such a liar.

986
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,160
>> But I'm not voting you

987
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,661
tonight.

988
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,537
I won't. I refuse.

989
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:55,872
>> So Russell's trying to vote

990
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:56,456
me out tonight?

991
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,790
>> We have to get out Rupert

992
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:58,207
or Colby.

993
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:58,916
>> I know.

994
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,168
He's got this whole thing, like,

995
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,002
he wants me and you to be, like,

996
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,045
at each other's throats...

997
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,255
>> I think he's worried that if

998
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,882
it's at the final three and it's

999
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:06,674
you, me, and him...

1000
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,091
>> He's gonna...

1001
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,593
>> ...you and I will take each

1002
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,970
other, and he'll be out.

1003
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,848
>> I'm-a get Danielle off

1004
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:14,724
tonight because it

1005
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:17,310
eliminates that pair.

1006
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,186
As soon as we get rid of

1007
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,188
Danielle, Parvati is going to

1008
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,898
be so scared of me, she's gonna

1009
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,107
stick to me like glue.

1010
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,734
And she's gonna vote the way

1011
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:25,818
I tell her to vote.

1012
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,236
There's only one thing that

1013
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,738
has to happen today, and that's

1014
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,239
Danielle go home.

1015
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,908
>> Really?

1016
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,035
<i>Really?</i>

1017
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,914
>> Yeah.

1018
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,457
>> It's funny how things change

1019
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,249
in this game.

1020
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,001
>> I know, I know, damn it.

1021
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,586
>> How did this get flipped

1022
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,003
on me?

1023
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:44,837
>> It's crazy.

1024
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,422
>> Why? Why do we want to keep

1025
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:47,173
Colby and Rupert around?

1026
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:47,632
That doesn't even make

1027
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:48,591
any sense.

1028
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:49,509
>> It doesn't make sense.

1029
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:50,760
It does not make sense.

1030
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:51,386
>> Russell running around

1031
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,553
double talking is hurting

1032
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,137
his game.

1033
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,222
He's getting outplayed by me

1034
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,892
and Danielle at this point, and

1035
00:32:57,975 --> 00:32:58,393
it's making him a little

1036
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,435
bit crazy.

1037
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,145
The only thing we have to do is

1038
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,855
make sure Jerri doesn't write

1039
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,982
your name down.

1040
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:08,945
>> I'm ripping my hair out.

1041
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:09,570
Do not change your vote tonight,

1042
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,364
no matter what he says to you.

1043
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:12,407
>> Oh, no, I won't.

1044
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,741
>> He's trying to vote me out.

1045
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,867
>> He's trying to vote her out

1046
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:15,868
tonight.

1047
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:16,244
>> It's Rupert.

1048
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,078
>> Insane-o.

1049
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,204
>> Are you crazy? It's Rupert.

1050
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,164
>> He's causing all this...

1051
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,166
craziness again.

1052
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,710
>> Please don't write my name

1053
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:33,803
down tonight.

1054
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,930
>> I want Danielle gone

1055
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:37,181
tonight.

1056
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,183
>> We need to get rid of Rupert.

1057
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,226
>> Bad move.

1058
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,477
You're going to be next.

1059
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,520
Not 'cause of me.

1060
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:43,479
>> Don't threaten me.

1061
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,605
>> Not 'cause of me.

1062
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,606
I'm trying to save you.

1063
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,691
You don't get rid of Danielle,

1064
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:47,775
you're gonna be after her.

1065
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:48,276
>> Why do you say that?

1066
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,403
>> It ain't me. It ain't me.

1067
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:51,404
I can't do nothin'.

1068
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:52,071
You have to help me help you.

1069
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,282
>> Who are you talking about?

1070
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,950
Explain to me why that's even...

1071
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:56,576
>> I can't.

1072
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,201
I'm telling you now, we have to

1073
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,245
get rid of Danielle tonight, or

1074
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:17,513
they will get rid of you.

1075
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,182
>> PROBST: Now bring in the

1076
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:22,143
members of our jury.

1077
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:26,147
Coach... Courtney... J.T....

1078
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,400
Amanda... and Candice, voted out

1079
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:34,614
at the last Tribal Council.

1080
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,616
Rupert, who's running this show

1081
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:39,410
right now?

1082
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,411
>> I don't know.

1083
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,622
It's probably between Parvati

1084
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,165
and Russell.

1085
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,334
>> PROBST: Danielle, ring true

1086
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,586
to you-- Russell and Parvati

1087
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:49,921
pretty much guiding the shots

1088
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,547
over here for the Villains?

1089
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,840
>> Um, I don't necessarily

1090
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:53,841
think that's true.

1091
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,051
I think the Villains make

1092
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:56,094
decisions together.

1093
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,053
>> PROBST: Really?

1094
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,262
This close to a million dollars,

1095
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,347
you all agree?

1096
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,556
>> Yeah, we're still together,

1097
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,265
aren't we?

1098
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,350
>> PROBST: That doesn't mean you

1099
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:02,517
agree.

1100
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,143
>> But we agree voting out the

1101
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:07,897
Heroes and sticking together.

1102
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,273
>> PROBST: So, Jerri, around

1103
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,650
camp must be fairly peaceful,

1104
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:11,692
then.

1105
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,276
The Villains all agree on the

1106
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,695
decisions, and Rupert and Colby

1107
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,030
going, "It's you or me, dude."

1108
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:16,864
>> Hell, no.

1109
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,241
It's never been quiet since day

1110
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,367
one playing this game, and it is

1111
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,161
certainly not quiet right now.

1112
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:22,703
>> PROBST: So, Danielle, why

1113
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,373
this illusion that it's one big

1114
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,290
happy family?

1115
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,458
>> There was just a

1116
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,251
miscommunication, Jeff,

1117
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,126
honestly.

1118
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,087
There were things said, and, no,

1119
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,463
not everybody agreed today, at

1120
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,673
all.

1121
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,258
It was mad chaos.

1122
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,343
>> "Crazy" could not describe

1123
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:38,594
what happened today.

1124
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,929
>> Craziness, crazy, crazy.

1125
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:40,555
>> Like, unnecessarily out of

1126
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:41,305
control, like...

1127
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,266
>> Danielle and I were pitted

1128
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,183
against each other.

1129
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,351
>> We were pitted against each

1130
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,937
other.

1131
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,146
>> PROBST: Parvati, what

1132
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:49,397
happened?

1133
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,650
>> Well... Russell came to me

1134
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:53,943
and told me that Danielle was

1135
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,486
trying to blindside me today.

1136
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,446
She said it was not true and

1137
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,240
went crazy. (laughs)

1138
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,075
And so Russell's trying to test

1139
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:01,284
loyalty.

1140
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,452
That's what I got from the

1141
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,996
whole thing.

1142
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:05,621
>> PROBST: So, Russell, you got

1143
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:06,914
caught.

1144
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:07,540
>> No, I didn't get caught doing

1145
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:08,875
nothin'.

1146
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:09,458
Today, Danielle came up to me

1147
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,961
before I said anything and said,

1148
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:12,837
"When do you...

1149
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,546
>> Lies. Liar. Liar.

1150
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:14,839
>> "...when do you want to get

1151
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:15,214
rid of..."

1152
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:15,673
Let me finish talking.

1153
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,258
Danielle knows where my loyalty

1154
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,509
lies, and that's with Parvati.

1155
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,136
If you gonna come up to me...

1156
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:20,928
>> And me, you've been

1157
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:21,304
telling me...

1158
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,805
>> If you gonna come up to me,

1159
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,348
if you gonna come to me and try

1160
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,391
to get rid of Parvati...

1161
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:25,766
>> For the last...

1162
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,435
>> ...then I'm gonna try to get

1163
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,060
rid of you.

1164
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:28,686
>> You just sat me on the beach

1165
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,396
and said that you don't want to

1166
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,606
go against Parvati at the end

1167
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:32,023
because you think...

1168
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,316
>> I wanted to see where you

1169
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,358
stood, and I exactly found out.

1170
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:34,984
>> Oh, really?

1171
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,277
>> The three of us are in an

1172
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,278
alliance, so I don't

1173
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:37,904
understand why.

1174
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,072
I haven't done anything to be

1175
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,073
disloyal to him.

1176
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:41,616
I don't understand why he's

1177
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,034
testing me.

1178
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:46,954
I don't know.

1179
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,416
(voice breaking): Oh, my God.

1180
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:56,255
(chuckles)

1181
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,798
>> PROBST: What are the tears

1182
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,342
about right now?

1183
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,676
>> (sobbing): I'm just a

1184
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,302
frigging wreck!

1185
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,429
I'm so exhausted, and I'm just

1186
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,056
like...

1187
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,390
It's just too much for me

1188
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,517
right now.

1189
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,896
Oh, man.

1190
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,190
I just had a rough day.

1191
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:17,026
We've been in an alliance since

1192
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:17,360
the beginning.

1193
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,946
I don't know why he's trying to

1194
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:20,404
mess with it.

1195
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,366
>> PROBST: Is it feeling

1196
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,450
personal to you?

1197
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,952
Is that hurting your feelings?

1198
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,370
>> Yeah!

1199
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,496
>> I don't understand how she's

1200
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,081
just putting it all on me.

1201
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,582
Why I'm trying to mess with it

1202
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,458
when she agreed totally

1203
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:33,125
with that.

1204
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,210
>> Because you were telling me

1205
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,336
she wanted to get me off.

1206
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,545
What am I supposed to say?

1207
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:37,630
>> And when she said, "Let's

1208
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:38,297
get rid of..."

1209
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,967
Can I finish, please?

1210
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:41,884
>> No.

1211
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:42,677
>> Whatever.

1212
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,719
>> You're such a liar.

1213
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:44,845
It wouldn't have happened.

1214
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:45,096
It didn't.

1215
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,722
>> It would have happened if I

1216
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,182
would have wanted it to happen.

1217
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:48,808
>> It would not have happened.

1218
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,102
I'm closer to Parvati than

1219
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:51,936
you think.

1220
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,771
>> Oh, really?

1221
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,773
>> Yeah, really.

1222
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,024
>> Okay.

1223
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:57,566
>> PROBST: Boy, that perked

1224
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,902
you up.

1225
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,487
>> We're all fine right now.

1226
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,364
There's no need for us to

1227
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,824
continue with this conversation.

1228
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:07,201
It's been resolved.

1229
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:09,328
At least, it was resolved today.

1230
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,788
>> PROBST: Well, it just got

1231
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,039
reopened when you said you're

1232
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,290
closer to Parvati than Russell

1233
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:13,666
thinks.

1234
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:14,834
>> No, he is underestimating,

1235
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,044
like, my friendship and my

1236
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,587
loyalty to her, and I don't

1237
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,423
like that, so I'm just letting

1238
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:21,340
him know that I would never do

1239
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:25,261
that to her.

1240
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,554
PROBST: All right, then let's

1241
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:27,596
get to the vote.

1242
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,347
Russell has the

1243
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:28,723
immunity necklace.

1244
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,516
You cannot vote for Russell.

1245
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,559
Everybody else is fair game.

1246
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,437
Danielle, you're up.

1247
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:45,740
>> Okay, second time's

1248
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,241
the charm, right?

1249
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:48,075
Hopefully, you're going home

1250
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,202
home tonight.

1251
00:38:59,253 --> 00:38:59,795
>> (whispers): You're closer to

1252
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,380
Parvati than I think?

1253
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,008
That makes me think that y'all

1254
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:04,592
got something going on, so I'm

1255
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:18,606
gonna have to cut that tie.

1256
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:21,609
>> I have absolutely no idea

1257
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,736
what just happened, but with

1258
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:27,073
this vote, I'm sealing my fate.

1259
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:32,495
>> PROBST: I'll go

1260
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:36,415
tally the votes.

1261
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:43,672
If anybody has the

1262
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,049
hidden immunity idol and you

1263
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,801
want to play it, now would be

1264
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,928
the time to do so.

1265
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:52,473
All right, once the votes are

1266
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,475
read, the decision is final.

1267
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,976
Person voted out will be asked

1268
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,144
to leave the Tribal Council

1269
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:57,520
area immediately.

1270
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,647
I'll read the votes.

1271
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,567
First vote...

1272
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,694
Rupert.

1273
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,323
Rupert.

1274
00:40:09,406 --> 00:40:11,575
Two votes Rupert.

1275
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,661
Rupert.

1276
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:17,248
Three votes Rupert.

1277
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:18,457
Danielle.

1278
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:18,874
Three votes Rupert,

1279
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,709
one vote Danielle.

1280
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,297
Danielle.

1281
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,132
That's three votes Rupert,

1282
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:29,468
two votes Danielle.

1283
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,679
Danielle.

1284
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,930
We're tied.

1285
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:33,848
Three votes Danielle, three

1286
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,432
votes Rupert.

1287
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,935
One vote left.

1288
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:40,146
14th person voted out and the

1289
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,356
sixth member of our jury:

1290
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,153
Danielle.

1291
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,612
You need to bring me your torch.

1292
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,627
Danielle, the tribe has spoken.

1293
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,923
>> Bye.

1294
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:16,765
>> PROBST: So here's what we

1295
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,559
learned tonight: the Villains

1296
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,769
are clearly not one big, happy

1297
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:21,395
family.

1298
00:41:21,478 --> 00:41:22,771
Colby and Rupert live to see

1299
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,481
another day, and it is

1300
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,233
anybody's game.

1301
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,026
Grab your torches.

1302
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:27,943
Head back to camp.

1303
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,070
Good night.

1304
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,833
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1305
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,044
from our next episode.

1306
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:49,298
>> PROBST: Next time on

1307
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:52,301
Survivor:

1308
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:52,885
>> I'm against you, Russell.

1309
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,595
>> PROBST: Russell is on the

1310
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,472
outs with the Villains.

1311
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,474
(Parvati giggles)

1312
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,226
So he tries to turn the Heroes

1313
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,101
to the dark side.

1314
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,269
>> Greatest Villain, the

1315
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:02,895
greatest Hero.

1316
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,897
I want to trust you all the way

1317
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:05,981
to the final three.

1318
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:12,488
>> Final three. Final three.

1319
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:14,448
>> Russell is insane.

1320
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:16,075
And tonight, I might have put

1321
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,952
my own foot in my mouth at

1322
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,411
Tribal Council by basically

1323
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,871
just calling him out in front

1324
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:21,205
of everybody.

1325
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:23,415
And I think he changed his vote

1326
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,500
the last minute, actually.

1327
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,876
I feel like I played a good

1328
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,503
game and maybe a little too

1329
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:27,962
aggressive this time.

1330
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,005
But I did the best that I could

1331
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,090
and that's all you can ask.
