00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,879
<i>Survivor:</i>
The Morgan and Drake tribes

3
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:07,257
were surprised by a big twist.
Your past has come back

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,093
to haunt you.
The six members that were

5
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:13,596
previously voted off
returned as a third tribe

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,391
with one thing on their mind.
>> Revenge, baby.

7
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:18,560
All about revenge.
>> PROBST: The Outcasts will

8
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:21,938
compete against Morgan and Drake
in a three-tribe challenge

9
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:26,609
and the stakes are severe.
Go!

10
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,486
It was an all-out battle
as the Outcasts

11
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,948
were playing for a chance
to get back in the game.

12
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:34,284
In the end,
the unbelievable happened...

13
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,953
The Outcasts defeat
Morgan and Drake!

14
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:38,955
...forcing Morgan and Drake
to Tribal Council,

15
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:40,957
each to vote out
one of their own,

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,960
while the Outcasts would vote
two of their own back in.

17
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:46,254
Back at Morgan, frustration hit
an all-time high.

18
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:48,298
>> The misfits...
>> Yeah.

19
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,592
>> ...have no right to be here.
>> None.

20
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,761
>> None.
>> PROBST: And Osten finally

21
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:55,346
threw in the towel.
>> Vote me right off,

22
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,141
'cause I don't deserve to win.
>> PROBST: At Drake, Jon and

23
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,226
Shawn were on the chopping
block.

24
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,645
>> I want both of you,
if you would, sit down and just

25
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,315
say why we should keep you.
>> I feel that I've shown that

26
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,193
I'm loyal to Drake.
>> Jon, I feel like

27
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,153
I can't trust him.
>> PROBST: Drake went to Tribal

28
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,280
Council first, and made their
decision.

29
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:17,035
Shawn.
The tribe has spoken.

30
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,288
The Morgan Tribal Council
then followed,

31
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:23,291
and Osten laid down his torch.
You had enough, Osten?

32
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,710
>> Yeah, I'm quitting.
I-I just can't go any further.

33
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,004
>> PROBST: This is a first for
me.

34
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:30,006
No need to vote.
Grab your torch.

35
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:35,678
Osten, per your wishes...
go home.

36
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,473
Tonight, the Outcasts begin
where Drake and Morgan

37
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:42,477
left off... at Tribal Council.
Find out which two Outcasts

38
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,188
will be voted back
into the game.

Have a seat.

43
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:11,941
Look at all these smiling faces:
Nicole, Skinny Ryan,

44
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:16,779
Lill, Burton,
Michelle and Trish.

45
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,990
Well, this is a first.
A tribe excited to come

46
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,951
to Tribal Council.
( laughing )

47
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,287
Congratulations.
>> Thank you.

48
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,122
>> Thank you.
>> PROBST: You guys did it,

49
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,499
you came back as a tribe
of Outcasts.

50
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,460
You defeated both
Morgan and Drake.

51
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,630
And tonight, you will now vote
two of you back into this game.

52
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,632
But first, Michelle,
tell me your reaction

53
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,759
when you heard me say
that you were

54
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:40,428
going to have a chance
to get back in this game.

55
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:44,098
>> I almost wet my pants,
to tell you the truth.

56
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,601
It was just amazing,
but we had

57
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,020
one thing on our minds, and
it was just winning for revenge.

58
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,272
So...
>> PROBST: How big a factor

59
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,483
was that for you, Ryan?
You've got "Die, jerks"

60
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,653
on your head.
Oh, it was a huge,

61
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,989
huge motivation, because, uh,
I felt I was never

62
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,325
let into the tribe.
And I felt like

63
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,327
a complete outcast.
So, uh, for me

64
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,621
to come back and then
just to look over

65
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,706
after we already won
and saw those guys

66
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,375
still struggling,
having no clue

67
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,502
what they're doing...
You know, that, that,

68
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,712
that feeling of revenge--
unbelievable.

69
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,257
>> PROBST: I've never seen
a celebration like that

70
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,842
at any challenge ever
in<i> Survivor.</i>

71
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:24,138
Burton, what was the key factor
for you guys doing so well?

72
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,850
>> It was an internal drive
that we all had.

73
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,020
We all pulled together
and we were determined--

74
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,690
no matter what the game was--
to win.

75
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,401
And we were not going
to stop at anything short.

76
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:40,989
So, this second chance,
for all of you guys, is huge.

77
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,199
Okay, here's how
it's going to work tonight.

78
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:45,827
What we're going to do
is give each of you

79
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,579
a chance to plead your case
about why you should represent

80
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:52,208
the Outcast Tribe
and go back into the game.

81
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:55,253
Nicole...
you got a lot of grudges.

82
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,672
I mean, they voted you out
first.

83
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,549
Why should these guys
put you back in?

84
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,718
I think one of the most
important reasons

85
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,928
I should go back in
is because I was voted out

86
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,888
for being the bad apple.
And I think my biggest

87
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,724
mistake in the game
was speaking my mind

88
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,892
which I think is also
one of my best traits.

89
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,853
I think that
I'll be able to bring

90
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,563
that true character
back into the game,

91
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,357
because it turns both ways.
I'll be able to kick some ass

92
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,568
with that same character
and, um, I think

93
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,529
I'll make you all proud.
>> PROBST: Well said.

94
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:24,532
Lill, why should they send
you back in there?

95
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:27,702
>> I went out there
and I gave it my all.

96
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,912
And I still want to prove them
son of a bitches

97
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,082
that I am tough.
I want to go back in, guys,

98
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,419
and I want to go back in hard.
No matter what happens tonight,

99
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,255
this was good.
This was sweet revenge.

100
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,883
>> PROBST: Trish, make your
case.

101
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,886
>> All right.
The bottom line is,

102
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,597
through this whole game,
I never took my eye

103
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,433
off of why I was here.
And I absolutely,

104
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,895
really want one of us
to win the million dollars.

105
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,606
So, put me back in the game
and I'll make sure that,

106
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:00,234
you know, one of the Outcasts
is the winner at the very end.

107
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,738
>> PROBST: Michelle, I know you
want back in this game.

108
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,449
Convince them.
>> All right, fellas,

109
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:10,578
this is what it comes down to.
We all know we're all deserving.

110
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,955
We've all been
kicked in the face.

111
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,792
And I'm telling you right now,
there's no better way to kick

112
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,001
those ass ...
back in the face

113
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,004
than by putting a sweet little
girl in there to do it for you.

114
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,131
( laughing )
You put me in there,

115
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,425
and I'll bring the Outcasts
straight to the top

116
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:28,471
where we should be.
>> PROBST: Ryan, your job now

117
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,349
is to convince them
that you're the man.

118
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,852
>> Uh, you guys know
how much I love

119
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:38,189
this game, and, uh,
you guys know how much heart

120
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,358
I have for the game.
Give me a chance

121
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:43,986
to carry the torch, so to speak,
into the game and, uh...

122
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,824
and bring the victory
to one of us.

123
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,452
>> PROBST: Burton, why you?
>> I'm about the most

124
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,330
competitive person I know.
And when I heard

125
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:57,458
that there was a chance
for two of us to go back in,

126
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,460
I swear to God,
there was nothing

127
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,130
I was going to do
not to let that happen.

128
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,382
And I'll also say that
whoever else goes in there,

129
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:07,260
if I'm able to go in,
you have my word

130
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,971
in front of everyone here,
I will never lie to you

131
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,390
in this game.
Never.

132
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,184
>> PROBST: All right.
Time to find out who's going

133
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,728
back into this game.
Here's how the voting will work.

134
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,898
One at a time you will go up.
You will be voting

135
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,359
for two separate people
on two separate pieces

136
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:27,029
of parchment.
You are voting people you want

137
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,824
back in this game.
You cannot vote for yourself.

138
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:39,876
Ryan, you're first.
>> Lill, I would never

139
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:52,138
Ryan, you're first.
>> Lill, I would never

140
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,599
put your name down unless it
was for something good.

141
00:07:54,682 --> 00:08:09,405
If it's not me, I hope it's you.
>> Burton, I'm voting you back

142
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:11,908
in because I know you can win
the individual immunities.

143
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,745
And if I can't win, I want
another Outcast member to win.

144
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:36,140
>> Ryan, you were my friend
from the very beginning.

145
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:40,394
You accepted me no matter what.
And I want you in almost as much

146
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,731
as I want to be in.
And I hope we can be together.

147
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:53,783
Thank you.
>> Nicole, I know you're one bad

148
00:08:53,866 --> 00:09:10,633
Thank you.
>> Nicole, I know you're one bad

149
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:16,013
bitch and I know
you'll go and get them.

150
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,396
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.

151
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:38,327
I know you're excited.
I'll remind you, the voting

152
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,788
is a little different tonight.
You want to see your name.

153
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,624
Two tribe members
who have the most votes

154
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:50,506
go back into the game.
I'll read the votes.

155
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:57,346
First vote...
Burton.

156
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:02,351
Lill.
One vote Lill, one vote Burton.

157
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:06,147
Burton.
That's two votes Burton.

158
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:10,151
Lill.
Two votes Lill,

159
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:15,323
two votes Burton.
Michelle.

160
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:21,037
One vote Michelle.
Nicole.

161
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,001
One vote Nicole.
Ryan.

162
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:32,923
One vote Ryan.
Trish.

163
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,885
One vote Trish.
Here's where we're at:

164
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,887
two votes Burton,
two votes Lill,

165
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,516
one vote everybody else.
Ryan.

two votes Lill,
two votes Ryan.

170
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:03,871
Two votes left.
First person going back

171
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:07,041
into the game...
Burton.

172
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,585
( clapping )
>> Congratulations, Burton.

173
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:12,421
>> Thank you, guys.
>> Congratulations.

174
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,966
>> I'll make you proud.
>> PROBST: Second person going

175
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:21,806
back into the game...
>> ( gasps ): Oh, my God!

176
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,266
>> PROBST: Lill.
( clapping )

177
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,312
>> I am a nice person.
>>Congratulations, Lill.

178
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,607
>> Oh, my God.
Oh, baby.

179
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,152
Oh, my God.
>> These guys are going down.

180
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,947
>> My heart.
>> PROBST: Lill,

181
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,284
Burton, grab your torches.
Get fire.

182
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,454
As always, fire represents
life in this game.

183
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:52,628
You now have fire again.
You are back in this game.

184
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:56,132
Michelle, Nicole,
Trish, Ryan, you've put your

185
00:11:56,215 --> 00:12:00,594
faith in these two
to carry on for the Outcasts.

186
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,305
For the last time, it's time
for you to go.

187
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:09,270
Michelle.
Nicole.

188
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:12,940
Trish.
Ryan.

189
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,868
We have one member of Morgan,
one from Drake.

190
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,454
The only question now is.
are you going to a new tribe,

191
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:29,874
or are you going back
to your old tribe?

192
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,501
Let's find out.
In here is one Drake buff,

193
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,211
one Morgan buff.
You guys need

194
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,672
to decide who's gonna
reach in here and determine

195
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:39,049
the fate for both of you.
I'll do it.

196
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:43,637
>> Get the Drake buff.
>> PROBST: Take it back

197
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,182
with you.
>> Oh, God, help me.

198
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,517
>> PROBST: Lill's going back to
Morgan.

199
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,062
Come on over, get your new buff.
It's a familiar color.

200
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,148
>> It is.
Thank you.

201
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,859
>> PROBST: Going back to Drake.
Guys, you have a second chance.

202
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,570
Nothing to be said
except, "Make the most of it."

203
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,530
It might be difficult,
re-assimilating back

204
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,824
into these tribes again.
That's why you'll be immune

205
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,868
from the vote
at the next Tribal Council.

206
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,912
Give you a few days
to find your new way.

207
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:18,005
Head back to camp.
( thunder booming )

208
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:28,182
Head back to camp.
( thunder booming )

209
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,731
>> If it's Burton,
you can give him the hammock.

210
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:39,068
>> I would like to
see Lill, maybe, or even that

211
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:43,072
Skinny Ryan guy.
If it's Burton, I will fall out.

212
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,616
The person I was most worried
about coming back

213
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,202
in the game was Burton.
I was like,

214
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,704
"Well, if he comes back
to the Drake Tribe,

215
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,748
will he be pissed off
at everybody?

216
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,917
Is he gonna let
bygones be bygones?

217
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,919
What's his attitude
going to be like?"

218
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,421
>> Whoever shows up.
>> It's time to go to bed.

219
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:07,596
We'll see them in the morning.
>> Never in a million years

220
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,099
would I have expected
a chance to get back in the

221
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,309
game, so I'm pretty excited
right now.

222
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,228
I don't know.
I'm sure there's gonna be

223
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,064
a lot of mixed emotions.
I'm sure there's gonna be a lot

224
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,941
of resentment on their part.
From my standpoint,

225
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,943
they all kicked me out.
So, yeah, there's

226
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,571
gonna be some, uh,
some making up to do

227
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:28,492
on both ends.
Are you guys asleep?

228
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,912
>> Hey.
What do you think?

229
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,665
>> What's up, Rupert?
>> Amazingly enough,

230
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:39,253
Burton shows up in a good mood,
happy to be here,

231
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:43,507
full of enthusiasm
and life and just pumped Drake

232
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,759
back up-- bang, immediately.
>> Welcome back, Burton.

233
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,970
>> Welcome back, Burton.
>> Thank you.

234
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,347
It's good to see you guys.
>> If you're hungry,

235
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,434
there's lentils.
>> Oh, beautiful.

236
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,769
Beautiful.
>> We're sorry, Burton.

237
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,188
>> And then the apologies
started.

238
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,441
"Burton we're so sorry
we voted for you."

239
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:03,152
>> Here's the way I look at it:
water under the bridge.

240
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,322
I'm back and I'm happy about it.
>> That's what we wanted

241
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,991
to hear, and you know what?
We're glad he's here,

242
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,994
because he's so strong.
We're gonna go further.

243
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,956
>> We can't be beat.
>> We definitely traded up.

244
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,459
>> Yeah, I'm part
of the Drake Tribe-- again,

245
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:21,128
but I can't forget the fact that
they did vote me off.

246
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,714
So, I don't know
if they're just kissing my ass,

247
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,716
or if they really
are happy to see me.

248
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:31,680
because, in the end,
it's a game about deceit.

249
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:50,532
>> Let's go get our new tribe
mate.

250
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,410
>> Who's that?
>> It's me, I'm sorry.

251
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,412
>> Hi, Lill.
>> Welcome home, Lill.

252
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,539
>> I heard a female's voice
getting off the boat

253
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,875
and I didn't know
who it was, and then,

254
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,419
when I took a glimmer
and looked, it was Lill--

255
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,380
I could tell by her hat.
I was like, "Lill!"

256
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,548
>> I told you at
Tribal Council, we loved you.

257
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,134
>> I'm going to try again.
I'm going to try to make you

258
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,303
proud of me again.
I arrived on the beach,

259
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,889
jumped out.
"Lill?! Lill, is that you?

260
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:16,558
"Oh, we are so glad it's you.
We were afraid

261
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:20,354
it was somebody else."
I'm thinking, "Whatever."

262
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:23,899
>> When we lost you, it hurt.
>> You better believe that.

263
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:27,695
>> We lost a family member.
We welcomed Lill with open arms.

264
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,072
I don't know
if she bought any of that.

265
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,574
I don't think she trusts me at
all because I was

266
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,244
partially responsible
for voting her out.

267
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,246
We love you, Lill, you know
that.

268
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,416
>> Well, I appreciate that,
but, I just didn't feel like I

269
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:45,754
was really a part of a group.
I just didn't fit in.

270
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:51,635
They are welcoming me,
but they voted me off.

271
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,431
I approached Andrew before,
the first nine days I was on.

272
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,891
He said to me,
he would get back to me

273
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:01,061
about Tribal Council.
But when it came down

274
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:04,314
to the voting,
he never did get back to me,

275
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,984
which just causes
hard feelings and resentment.

276
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:12,489
>> This is by far the worst
night we've been out here.

277
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,961
>> It's good to have you back,
man.

278
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:29,923
>> It's good to be back.
>> Can I ask you a couple

279
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,800
questions?
>> Sure.

280
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,845
>> Away from all of these guys?
>> Yeah.

281
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,765
>> Come here.
>> Rupert pulled me aside

282
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:41,310
right away, so I thought,
"Oh, this is

283
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,812
either going to go good,
or it's going to go bad."

284
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,274
I didn't know what to expect.
>> Got to look me in the eye.

285
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,319
>> All right.
>> I'll tell you my reason.

286
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,197
I wanted to look him in the eye
and say, "This is why

287
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,450
I agreed to vote you out."
You laughed at me in my dress

288
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,660
and made me feel bad.
You, you...

289
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:03,290
I heard you say something
about a big kid in a sandbox,

290
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,959
laughing at me
about my plumber's crack.

291
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,295
I didn't like the way
that he treated me

292
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,298
in the start of this game,
and that hurt me and I wanted

293
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:15,344
him to know that that hurt me.
You took that road

294
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,055
that every jock
in my life has taken.

295
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:21,183
I was beneath you guys.
I heard you guys

296
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,477
laugh and joke about me.
I heard you guys...

297
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,355
I portray a very strong
and independent person,

298
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:30,859
but, in my head,
I'm that fat little terrified

299
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,779
kid that was picked on
in school all his life.

300
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,156
And I saw Burton
being those son of a bitches

301
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,201
that would make fun of me.
>> Well, I wish you would have

302
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,537
said something to me.
And I feel awful.

303
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,997
I have a lot of respect
for Rupert.

304
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,208
I hurt his feelings
and I felt bad.

305
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,418
I felt really bad.
Well, I apologize for

306
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,420
that, I honestly do,
because I had no intention

307
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,548
of making you feel weird.
>> You made me feel

308
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,843
like I was getting used, so...
>> Well, I apologize for that.

309
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,720
>> Within two minutes of
talking, all fears were

310
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:03,183
subsided, all hesitation was
gone-- everything was good.

311
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,561
>> If, if we go to next Tribal,
what would happen?

312
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:09,022
>> Jon's out. Guaranteed.
>> All of a sudden, Rupert

313
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,733
said, "If there's a Drake to go,
it's going to be

314
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,069
Jon first," and...
I about fainted.

315
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,947
I could not believe it.
>> He wrote my name down

316
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,700
on the 18th day.
>> He wrote my name down

317
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,202
on the 12th day.
>> I'm writing his name down

318
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,413
the next time
we go to Tribal Council.

319
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,249
>> You are sure
it would not be me again,

320
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,459
it would be Jon?
>> Jon. He's out.

321
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,296
Then it's down to you and me
and Chris and Sandra.

322
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,923
>> For me, it was a second
chance at life in this game.

323
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,759
Good to see you on this side.
>> It's good to have you back.

324
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,761
We're gonna be
a stronger team now.

325
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:53,275
>> Oh, yeah.
>> Well, I've been away

326
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:57,613
for nine days, and I come back
and the Morgan Tribe...

327
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:03,911
needs some help,
some serious help.

328
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:07,289
I went and got water.
I've been collecting firewood.

329
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,459
I don't know what else to do.
I don't know what else

330
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,919
to help them with.
These people,

331
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:15,589
they have no energy.
They have nothing.

332
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,758
I mean, they are just...
they're becoming

333
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:22,930
like dead weight.
>> At the next

334
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,557
Immunity Challenge,
you can't be voted out.

335
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:30,270
You get a bye.
If we lose, you know, one of us,

336
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:35,400
one of the four, are going home,
and you're not going anywhere.

337
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,445
>> I have immunity
for the first Tribal Council,

338
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:42,282
and I feel like I've got
somewhat of a second chance,

339
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,035
and... they resent it.
>> We killed ourselves

340
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:49,706
to make it five-five,
so we go into the merge even.

341
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,167
And then we go yesterday
to the reward challenge

342
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:57,214
and this happens.
We're like...

343
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:01,885
"What the hell?"
I woke up this morning

344
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,845
really angry.
I almost had to pinch myself.

345
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,347
"Is this real?
"Am I hallucinating?

346
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,684
This is day 20.
Why the hell is Lill here?"

347
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,645
Nice new buff, though.
>> Oh, yeah.

348
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:14,189
That's okay.
We welcome the curveballs.

349
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:15,857
Bring them on.
Let's see where

350
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:19,528
we're going to go next.
>> It's clearing up some.

351
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,906
I'm trying to fit in again.
I'm trying to find

352
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,866
my niche again.
I've learned that

353
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,328
this is a game.
And I want to stay in

354
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:43,218
as long as I can.
>> What is it?

355
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:45,345
>> It looks like an orange.
>> It smells like a lemon.

356
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,389
>> Tangerine.
>> I think it...

357
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,349
I think it's lemon.
>> They found a lemon tree

358
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,518
since I've been gone,
which is great news to me.

359
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,854
It's almost like
I'm starting over from scratch.

360
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,522
There's all these new things.
Christa, you want

361
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,399
to run down there?
>> Sure.

362
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,568
>> So, uh, we're going to go
find this lemon tree,

363
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,862
get some more lemons.
>> Jon wants me to stay with

364
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,905
him and help him out.
>> He needs help cooking.

365
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,907
>> Okay.
>> We'll be back.

366
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:11,288
>> Yeah, we'll be right back.
Jon did not want us

367
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:14,082
all four to go.
>> Yeah.

368
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,751
>> He's paranoid.
>> He thinks he's

369
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,919
the next one to go.
>> Well, he should be paranoid.

370
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,298
>> The thing is, I have
this philosophy that we need to

371
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:24,051
tell each other the truth.
And he has done nothing but lie

372
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,094
all of the time.
>> Right.

373
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,472
>> There's the lime trees.
>> Oh, my God, look at that.

374
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,975
>> My lying's done with, 'cause
if we're all lying to each other

375
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,144
and screwing each other over...
>> Right.

376
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,813
>> ...the Morgans are going to
end up winning the thing.

377
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,149
The conversation we had was
kind of a confirmation of

378
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,942
"I want you guys
to know I'm honest.

379
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,070
"I'm not going to play
any games.

380
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,280
I'm not going to be deceitful."
>> I say screw Jon.

381
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,282
Because he's the one
that's going to be

382
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,409
trying to play 500
games at the same time.

383
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,788
And if we ever have a merge,
he's going to go over to Morgan

384
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,623
and try to play
with all those people.

385
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,417
I was trying to figure out,
if there ever was a merge

386
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,461
with the Morgan Tribe,
what could happen.

387
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,755
I thought, "Jon
gets on a lot of people's nerves

388
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,757
real quickly."
>> They're not gonna take him.

389
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,801
They're not gonna believe him.
They're not gonna trust him.

390
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,928
>> Hold on-- the only thing,
though: If the Morgans

391
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,138
need him, they might take him.
>> Right.

392
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,057
>> Not because they like him,
but because they don't

393
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,435
have a choice.
>> Right.

394
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,948
>> We are making rice
this morning. Uh...

395
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,659
>> Our last rice.
>> We only have, I think,

396
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:35,288
one serving of rice left.
So...

397
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:39,793
>> That's it.
( whispers ): That's it.

398
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:50,011
>> Oh, gosh, that's it.
>> Food, as of this morning,

399
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,848
definitely shifted from
critical to dire.

400
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,016
It's terrifying.
Frankly, I don't know

401
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,353
what we'll do.
>> We're suffering.

402
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:01,356
Rice was the one staple that
was consistent for us,

403
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,692
kept our energy up,
and we don't have it now, and

404
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,194
I don't know how that will play
a factor in our performance

405
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,364
when we have challenges.
We'll have to see.

406
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:18,999
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.
Drake and Morgan each getting

407
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:21,543
their first look
at the new tribes.

408
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,504
Let's talk about how you guys
are doing 21 days in.

409
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,340
Sandra, what's the
food issue like?

410
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:30,051
>> There is no food issues.
Um... this morning we had

411
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,928
rice and corn.
Yesterday, we ate about

412
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:35,265
12, 15 pounds of fish.
Um, then we had some

413
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,892
refried beans at night,
and everyone went

414
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,436
to sleep with full tummies.
>> PROBST: Now, I haven't been

415
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,271
to Morgan's beach, but I'm
looking at Savage.

416
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,023
I'm gathering you guys aren't
doing as well?

417
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:45,358
>> Actually, we just...
we don't have any food.

418
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:49,112
We're surviving right now
on mussels and, uh, coconut.

419
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,615
Did any of you guys come here
today expecting a merge?

420
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,450
Were you counting on
that to save you?

421
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,244
>> No. Uh, honestly,
I have not expected a merge.

422
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,872
I don't expect some big buffet
under some table.

423
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,750
>> PROBST: Once again, the game
changes when you least expect

424
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,085
it.
Drop your buffs.

425
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,588
>> Oh, my God!
>> PROBST: We're merging.

426
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,924
>> Oh, yeah.
>> PROBST: Drop them at your

427
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,051
feet.
Drake is no more,

428
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:14,304
Morgan is no more.
You are one tribe.

429
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,640
>> And they're black, baby.
Yeah!

430
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:23,146
>> Thank you.
>> Oh, my God.

431
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,733
Give me a hug.
( sighs )

432
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,069
>> PROBST: So, here's how it
works-- you'll come up

433
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:31,279
with a new tribe name,
paint a new tribe flag.

434
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,241
Based on what I just heard,
you're going to be living

435
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,243
on Drake's beach.
From this point forward,

436
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,453
all challenges are individual.
That means all rewards

437
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:41,915
are won by an individual,
and immunity is won

438
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:46,753
by an individual.
So, I'll take that back.

439
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:52,759
Tribal immunity, no more.
This is now what you covet.

440
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,761
>> Ah...
>> PROBST: And it's what you're

441
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:57,639
playing for today-- individual
immunity.

442
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,599
Ready to hear
about the challenge?

443
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,643
>> Yeah.
>> Yep.

444
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,812
>> PROBST: Today's challenge is
based on a pirate punishment

445
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,606
called keel hauling.
A pirate who'd been bad was tied

446
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,483
to a rope and dragged
underneath the boat.

447
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:10,568
If the sharks didn't get you,
the barnacles would certainly

448
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,613
cut you up, and you had to hold
your breath the entire time.

449
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,824
Today's challenge is based on
the same principle.

450
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,660
You will jump into the ocean,
swim underneath a platform

451
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,161
by pulling yourself
along a rope.

452
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,330
You got to hold your breath
the entire time.

453
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,374
If you come up in the middle,
you start over.

454
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,626
When you get to the end,
you'll reach a ladder.

455
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,336
Climb up and race
back to the start.

456
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,548
We will run two heats.
First two to complete two laps

457
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,759
in each elimination round
moves to the final.

458
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:40,724
Swim out to the boat,
wait for my "Go."

459
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:44,019
All right, we've randomly drawn
numbers to select your order.

460
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,022
For the first heat,
you will complete two laps.

461
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,524
The top two finishers
move on to the final.

462
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:54,487
First heat is Tijuana, Christa,
Rupert, Jon and Sandra.

463
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:58,992
Survivors ready?
Go!

464
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,669
Rupert out of the water first.
Christa right behind him.

465
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,546
Jon in it.
T.

466
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,715
now in it.
One more lap.

467
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:18,219
Move, move, move, T.
Let's go, Sandra, don't give up.

468
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:25,352
>> Oh... I'm the only one?
Ooh!

469
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,729
>> PROBST: Rupert. Jon.
Here comes Christa.

470
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:32,025
It's Rupert and it's...
...Jon.

471
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:36,237
>> Yeah!
>> PROBST: Close finish.

472
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:40,617
Swim on back over
to the boat, guys.

473
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,078
Here we go, heat number two.
Savage, Lill, Burton,

474
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:47,290
Darrah and Ryno.
Two laps, top two finishers

475
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:50,585
move on to take on
Rupert and Jon in the final.

476
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:54,005
Survivors ready?
Go!

477
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:10,605
Savage having trouble.
Ryno out of the water first.

478
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:15,819
Following right behind, Burton.
Darrah right in this.

479
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:18,488
Burton and Ryno back in.
Go, Darrah, go.

480
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:27,288
That a way, Lill.
Savage trailing.

481
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,500
It's Burton and Ryno--
sprint to the finish.

482
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:34,045
Burton's in,
and Ryno is in.

483
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:39,467
Burton and Ryno
moving on to the finals.

484
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,137
Jon, Rupert, Ryno,
Burton in the final.

485
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,307
Here's how the final round
works-- you'll complete five

486
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,185
laps, at the end of each lap,
you'll grab a gold medallion,

487
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,187
move it from the back
of your platform

488
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,690
to the front of your platform.
First tribe member to

489
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,942
complete all five laps
and transfer all five medallions

490
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:58,778
from back to front
wins immunity.

491
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:05,910
Survivors ready?
Go!

492
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:16,713
Rupert out of the water first.
Everybody else close behind.

493
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,674
Burton and Ryno.
Jon.

494
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:21,843
>> You got it, Rupert.
>> PROBST: Rupert has his

495
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,970
first medallion.
Burton has his first.

496
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:30,518
Jon and Ryno both have their
first.

497
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:34,189
Rupert out of the water again,
leading the pack.

498
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,483
Grabs his second medallion.
There's Burton

499
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:42,197
with his second medallion.
Ryno and Jon

500
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:50,497
fighting for third.
Rupert out of the water again,

501
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,707
with a bigger lead.
>> You got it, Rupert.

502
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,084
>> PROBST: Third medallion.
>> You got it, Burton.

503
00:29:55,168 --> 00:30:02,217
>> PROBST: Burton on his tail.
Ryno close behind.

504
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:07,180
Jon falling out of this.
Rupert with his fourth

505
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,390
medallion.
>> Go, Rupert...

506
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,726
>> PROBST: Burton closing the
gap.

507
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:14,771
It's a tight race.
Rupert, Burton.

508
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:26,950
>> Come on, Ryno.
>> PROBST: One lap to go, guys.

509
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:30,954
Rupert going for his fifth.
Burton going for his fifth.

510
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:35,792
It's a race to the finish,
got to get it on the f...

511
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:40,129
Burton wins immunity by a hair.
Burton, swim on over.

512
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:46,553
Immunity waiting for you.
Put this on.

513
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:49,931
Put an arm through.
Strap it on like the pirate

514
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:53,560
I know you want to be.
Very interesting dynamic now.

515
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,979
You already have immunity
as a result of

516
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,814
the resurrection vote.
You now win

517
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:00,233
individual immunity.
You can assign that to somebody,

518
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,277
knowing you'll still be immune,
or you can hoard it

519
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,404
and make sure
everybody else is vulnerable

520
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:06,447
at tonight's Tribal Council.
You have this afternoon

521
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,575
to think about it.
You can head back to camp

522
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:11,286
in your new boat.
Take this with you and bring it

523
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,289
to future challenges.
Hey, one more thing, guys.

524
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,957
Savage, that buffet
you referred to?

525
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,792
Waiting for you
back at the camp.

526
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:27,844
( cheering and clapping )
>> As soon as you think

527
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:44,485
( cheering and clapping )
>> As soon as you think

528
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,988
you got the game figured out,
they say, "Throw your buffs

529
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,115
down and you're all in one
tribe. "

530
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,992
We're now going
to be the Balboas,

531
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,536
which I love, you know.
That's my snake's name.

532
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,122
And it's so nice
to have new people in our home.

533
00:31:56,205 --> 00:32:01,127
>> Balboas!
( cheering )

534
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,838
>> It is a merge
between the Morgan Tribe

535
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:06,174
and the Drake Tribe.
We're coming together as one.

536
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:09,552
And it'll be interesting to see,
"Will everyone be unified?"

537
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,304
Or will it still be
two separate tribes

538
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:14,182
living together as one.
>> Whoa!

539
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,851
>> Cheese!
>> Wine!

540
00:32:16,934 --> 00:32:19,604
( cheering )
>> We rolled in,

541
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,357
and there was a feast just
waiting for us on a table--

542
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,069
ribs, bread, cheese, oranges,
nuts, everything--

543
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,780
the works--
and we just tore down.

544
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:31,491
>> Balboa!
>> Balboa!

545
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:36,579
( cheering )
>> The feast was great.

546
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:41,250
I got some ribs,
a big old hunk of lamb.

547
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:44,712
>> Anyone want bread?
>> Yeah.

548
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,548
>> Oh, heaven!
>> Does anyone care if I double

549
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,051
dip?
>> No.

550
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,720
>> Not at all.
( loud burp )

551
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,556
>> That food was heaven.
It made me feel human again.

552
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,351
And from a morale standpoint,
I realize I may actually

553
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,937
make it out of this place.
>> I depend on Rupert for my

554
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:05,233
meal.
>> For a few solid moments,

555
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:09,779
we were all together as one.
But I knew that here is where

556
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:12,407
the true game starts.
>> We have to figure

557
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:16,536
out who goes first.
We're thinking Little Jon.

558
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,830
We can't stand Little Jon.
He's arrogant.

559
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,749
He's out for himself.
We don't trust him, and

560
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:30,049
we would love to see him go.
>> I know. I know.

561
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:33,052
There was a little worry
on my part, and then Lill was

562
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,430
sitting there like a golden
goddess.

563
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,890
She was kicked out of that
tribe.

564
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,017
She was pissed off.
She hates their guts.

565
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,645
She goes, "As soon as I pulled
that buff out," she goes,

566
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,605
"I was about to cry."
She goes, "Not because

567
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,983
I was back in the game.
"'Cause I was back

568
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,277
with those people
that stabbed me in the back."

569
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,946
>> We were trying to figure out
how we could turn one Morgan

570
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:54,157
against the others,
and we find that little Lill

571
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,284
already kind of resented them
for voting her out.

572
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,161
>> She hates them.
>> Does Burton know?

573
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:09,172
>> Yep.
>> Really far.

574
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,591
>> Are you sure?
>> Yes.

575
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,801
>> Burton took me aside.
He says, "It's like this.

576
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,512
"We're going to try to go
all the way, you and I.

577
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:20,308
The Drake Tribe wants you,
and you only."

578
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,977
I have to think that
maybe he's on the up-and-up.

579
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,104
>> Did y'all talk to Lill?
>> Uh-uh.

580
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,190
>> What is she doing?
>> I have no idea.

581
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:30,485
>> We've seen Lill and Burton
talking a lot,

582
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,528
so they could have
something going on.

583
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,530
And, if Lill goes
to the bad guys,

584
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,616
we're in serious trouble.
Do you want to vote

585
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:39,952
with the Morgans?
>> I don't know.

586
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,622
>> It's important to us.
>> You guys are ready

587
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:46,000
to ditch me off again.
>> What are you talking about?

588
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:49,712
>> The same people are still
there that voted me off.

589
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,799
You... you can't tell me
that you'd have put me

590
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:56,594
before the other three people.
You guys would have

591
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:59,055
ditched me in a minute
if we stayed as Morgans.

592
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:01,349
I had immunity.
>> And you don't think they

593
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,351
would?
You don't think they would?

594
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,478
Oh, please.
>> I don't know.

595
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,522
I don't know.
>> That's very naive.

596
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,649
You're being...
>> I have not totally

597
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:12,151
decided yet, and I... and that's
all I can say now.

598
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,821
I have not totally decided yet.
>> Will you let me know before?

599
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,532
>> Remember, I asked you
to let me know before,

600
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,701
and you didn't?
I don't know.

601
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:24,705
I have to decide
before I get there though.

602
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,542
I am in a whirlwind right now.
I just... You don't know

603
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,503
which way to turn.
They're all offering friendship.

604
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:34,590
Whether or not I can trust all
this, I can't really say.

605
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:38,719
>> I think we go after Savage.
If he's the head over there, we

606
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,013
chop the head off.
>> I know Andrew feels

607
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,850
as if he's close
to being on the cutting block

608
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,727
because I think the Drake Tribe,
they want to vote out the

609
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,896
strongest on the Morgan side.
And, definitely, the swing vote

610
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,065
tonight could be Lill.
She could potentially go

611
00:35:51,148 --> 00:36:01,158
with Morgan or Drake.
>> PROBST: Welcome.

612
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:10,751
with Morgan or Drake.
>> PROBST: Welcome.

613
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:14,422
First thing I need to ask...
T, what was the reaction today

614
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,300
when you guys heard
there was going to be a merge?

615
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,760
>> Shocked.
Um, because it is a

616
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:24,223
merge that can be of a benefit,
but it also can hurt us all.

617
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,726
Overall, I'm looking at it in
an optimistic view,

618
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:30,062
but it... it was a shock.
It was a shock.

619
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,273
>> PROBST: Lill, you go
back to Morgan, you're there

620
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,567
for a day, and then, suddenly,
you merge.

621
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,986
How are you feeling
about everything?

622
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:39,906
>> I am thrilled.
I'm thrilled with the merger.

623
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:43,117
I'm ready for it.
I'm just glad that

624
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,454
I now have a larger family.
>> PROBST: Ryno, you still

625
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,290
have 18 days left in the game.
Now you're one big tribe,

626
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,792
and it is an individual game.
So how do you vote

627
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,253
from this point forward?
>> Yeah, it... it's hard for me

628
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,464
right now.
I... I'm looking at everybody,

629
00:36:56,547 --> 00:37:00,134
and I... I don't know them
well enough to write their name

630
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:03,429
down, but I don't know.
I mean, the feast

631
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,932
was so great today,
and then coming here,

632
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:09,143
it's, like, it sucks.
>> PROBST: Here's how

633
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:12,480
the individual immunity
works in terms of assigning

634
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,858
it to someone.
It's a little unusual tonight.

635
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:19,403
Lill and Burton, as a result
of resurrecting themselves back

636
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:22,657
into this game, were given
immunity simply to give

637
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,326
them a chance to reintegrate
back into this game.

638
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:28,955
Burton then goes and wins
individual immunity today.

639
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,666
That immunity is assignable,
meaning you can give

640
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,460
it to somebody else
here tonight and protect them.

641
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,671
Typically, that would make you,
yourself, vulnerable.

642
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,839
Tonight, you won't be.
You have nothing to lose

643
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:43,010
by giving it to somebody.
So, Burton, do you want to give

644
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,346
that immunity to anybody?
I've done a lot of thinking

645
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,516
about it and, uh...
it is quite an unusual

646
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:56,357
situation, and I do believe
I will pass this immunity on.

647
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:03,155
Such a close fight,
I couldn't not give it to you.

648
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,533
There are now three people
you cannot vote for tonight.

649
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,160
You cannot vote for Lill,
you cannot vote

650
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,413
for Burton and, now,
you cannot vote

651
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:14,041
for Rupert as well.
Time to vote.

652
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:26,429
Savage, you're up.
>> Little Jon, you talk too much

653
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:40,776
smack.
>> Ooh, yeah, Mr. Macho...

654
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,821
Mr. Savage...
going down.

655
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:53,873
Dig it?
>> You're our biggest

656
00:38:53,956 --> 00:39:00,588
Dig it?
>> You're our biggest

657
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:04,508
threat out here.
Bye.

658
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,728
>> Jonny Fairplay,
this message goes for you.

659
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:19,982
You're a troublemaker
and you're very manipulative.

660
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:44,507
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.

661
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,269
>> PROBST: Once the votes are
read, the decision is final.

662
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,772
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the Tribal

663
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:04,652
Council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.

Seventh person voted out
of the tribe:

Andrew.
Need to bring me your torch.

677
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:24,773
Andrew, the tribe has spoken.
It's time for you to go.

678
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:34,867
>> Ryno, D, T, hang tough.
>> PROBST: You've survived 21

679
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:42,249
>> Ryno, D, T, hang tough.
>> PROBST: You've survived 21

680
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,627
days.
At the very least, you will

681
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,254
be a member of the jury.
You still have 18 days left,

682
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,256
so I suggest you
head back to camp,

683
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,258
get up tomorrow,
and get to work.

684
00:41:51,342 --> 00:42:01,310
Good night, guys.
Stay tuned for scenes

685
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:12,279
Good night, guys.
Stay tuned for scenes

686
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:19,119
from our next episode.
Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>

687
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,789
Life after the merge is rocky.
>> I think the Morgan Tribe is,

688
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,958
just in general, very lazy.
>> They work more than

689
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,627
what is necessary.
>> PROBST: Tribal alliances

690
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,629
fall apart.
>> Take Rupert out?

691
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,257
We're crazy if we don't.
>> What if we got rid of Burton

692
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,509
and kept the two females around?
>> PROBST: And the food fights

693
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,761
back.

>> I am unbelievably proud to be
part of the Morgan Tribe.

698
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,691
We went through hell.
And to rally from losing the

699
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:51,819
first three immunities, to even
the score to five Morgan to five

700
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,655
Drake, is a phenomenal
accomplishment.

701
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,991
Cheers to Morgan.
Ryno, D, and T,

702
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,660
stick it to Drake.
Show them what we're made of.

703
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:02,913
And continue to make
all of us proud.
