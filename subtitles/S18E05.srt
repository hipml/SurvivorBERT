>> Pow! (grunting)

5
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,093
>> PROBST: ...two tough tribes,

6
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:12,595
Jalapao and Timbira, battled it

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,931

13
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:25,316
Brendan, choose one member of

14
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,193
the winning tribe to join you

15
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,320

a chance to inform Sierra,

38
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,691
leaving Taj to do it the next

39
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,568
time at Exile Island.

40
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:09,569
>> Once we get to the merge,

41
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:10,904
we'll have a four-way alliance

42
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:11,488
that no one knows about and

43
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,989
can't break up.

44
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:15,325
>> Awesome.

45
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,826
>> PROBST: Taj zeroed in on the

whereabouts of the hidden

immunity idol at Jalapao.

tree mail.

50
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,583
>> PROBST: But she didn't have a

51

chance to look for it.

52
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:27,253
However...

53
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,254
>> Yes!

54
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,089
>> PROBST: Brendan made the

55
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,759
discovery at Timbira.

56
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:33,510
At the last immunity

57
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,385
challenge...

58
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,345
>> Oh, my God!

59
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,262
>> PROBST: Timbira does win

60
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,056
immunity!

61
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,934
Timbira evened things up when

62
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,352
they forced Jalapao to lose

63
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,812
another member.

64
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,814
Sandy, the tribe has spoken.

65
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:48,191
With the tribes dead even at

66
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:51,361
six apiece, it's anyone's game.

67
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,363
12 are left.

68
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,241
Who will be voted out tonight?

69
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,621
(Taj moaning)

70
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:02,288

71
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,289
(grunting)

72
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,124
Yes, right there!

73
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:05,875
Yes, yes!

74
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,253
Itchy, ooh!

75
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:11,297
Ahh, yes!

76
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,465
Oh, my God.

77
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,842
You're doing it, baby.

78
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,468
You are doing it.

79
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,178
We got rid of Sandy last night.

80
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,055
I only wrote Joe's name down on

81
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:20,223
the paper at, uh, Tribal Council

82
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,307
because I didn't want to put

83
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,393
Sandy's name down.

84
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,811
I need to get some more water.

85
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,062
I'm out of water.

86
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:27,105
>> I'll go with you.

87
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:27,730
>> Yeah, we can go fill up the

88
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,316
bottles together.

89
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,818
>> Right now, everything with

90
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,278
Brendan, Sierra, and Stephen is

91
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,279
in place.

92
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,446
We have the Exile Island

93
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,740
alliance intact.

94
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,243
Our main focus right now is to

95
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,245
find the idol.

96
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,246
We're just set with the four

97
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:43,580
people in place.

98
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,290
Now, all we need is the extra

99
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,416
ammunition and then it's on.

100
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,597
Something has to be...

101
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,265
Something must be something.

102
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,267
'Cause it says, "Why the sad

103
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,352
frown?"

104
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,437
>> That's what it is: "Why the

105
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,271
sad frown?"

106
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:08,771
>> That was the last clue.

107
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,982
"You get your mail from it

108
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,443
every day," and, uh, something

109
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,653
"round, and you'll ask it why

110
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:19,073
the sad frown."

111
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,533
>> I swear to you... Oh, my God!

112
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,994
>> Oh, my God!

113
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,203
I found the immunity idol,

114
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,622
and I felt a very huge sense of

115
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,373
relief because everything is

116
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,625
complete now.

117
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,126
We have the foursome in place.

118
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,628
We have both the idols in place.

119
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,004
All we have to do now is make

120
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:33,630
it to the merge with everybody

121
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,255
intact.

122
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,090
"If you intend to use the

123
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:36,883
idol, you must reveal it or

124
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,384
give it away to someone else...

125
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,594
the votes have been cast... "

126
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:40,428
All right.

127
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,639
I just love it when a perfect

128
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,140
plan comes together.

129
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:45,475
It's so much fun!

130
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,937
(laughing)

131
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,021
Okay, stuff this in your pocket.

132
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:50,855
Do something with it.

133
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:51,981
Hide it.

134
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:52,857
>> Should we bury it or do you

135
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,275
think I should put it in my

136
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,193
pants?

137
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:55,902
>> Um, I think we should

138
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:56,611
keep it.

139
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,111
They won't suspect you.

140
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,029
They're looking at me.

141
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:58,696
>> Right.

142
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,364
>> So, keep it on you.

143
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:00,531
Keep it on you close.

144
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,241
Um, you know, if you bend down,

145
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,534
be cognizant that something will

146
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,702
show, the shape of your pockets

147
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,787
will show, so always protect

148
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,788
yourself.

149
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:07,413
Grab the bottle.

150
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:07,789
Let's get back.

151
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:08,414
>> Taj and I found the idol

152
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,333
together and she immediately

153
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,377
handed it off to me because

154
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,294
I was the one with pockets so I

155
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,214
could better conceal it.

156
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,215
>> Ooh, I'm sweating.

157
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:17,840
>> Oh, my God!

158
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:18,549
We got it, girl!

159
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,425
>> I know, I know, I told you

160
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,968
it was going to work out.

161
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:20,551
I'm telling you, once we make

162
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:21,970
it to the merge, it's smooth

163
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:22,595
sailing.

164
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,429
>> I mean, I'm delighted to

165
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,889
have it but, you know, as long

166
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:25,974
as it's in my possession, I'm

167
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:26,975
going to try to keep it in my

168
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:27,350
possession.

169
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,435
Theoretically and ostensibly,

170
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,353
it is mine.

171
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:30,895
I'm the one wearing the idol

172
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:31,521
around my neck.

Who's all down there?

194
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,631
>> Coach and Tyson.

195
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,382
>> Okay, I wanted to know if

196
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,051
you need any extra hands.

197
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:25,927
>> We got it, I think.

198
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,012
Thanks. You rest.

199
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:28,721
>> Okay.

200
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:29,847
>> So...

201
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,974
>> Dude, you didn't tell me.

202
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:32,934
I was standing there and I walk

203
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:33,559
in and she's like, "I gotta

204
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,560
tell you about this four-way

205
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,145
alliance."

206
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:36,646
And I was like...

207
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,108
(laughing)

208
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,192
I'm gonna kill you.

209
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,110
>> Dude, but it works.

210
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,111
All right, so...

211
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:43,861
>> Were you going to tell me?

212
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,196
You bastard.

213
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:45,947
>> Yes!

214
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:46,739
I didn't have a chance to speak

215
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:47,615
with Sierra before the

216
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,991
challenge, so, I didn't tell her

217
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,701
about the plan with Taj.

218
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,536
It could have been disaster.

219
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,161
It could have blown the whole

220
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,162
thing up.

221
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:53,746
>> And then she got the clue.

222
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,123
>> Yeah.

223
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:55,957
>> She turned around to me and

224
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,499
she showed it to me.

225
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,793
>> Yep.

226
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,128
Yep, I have it.

227
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,295
>> Every single kind of stage

228
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,339
that we've set has worked and

229
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:03,923
every time we've layered more

230
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,092
people into the plan, you know,

231
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:06,634
we've gotten more and more

232
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,178
powerful.

233
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,639
Good, right?

234
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,391
>> That four-way alliance is

235
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,225
insane.

236
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:14,684
>> Perfect.

237
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,852
>> We're going down to the end

238
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:16,185
no matter what.

239
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,311
>> Yeah, perfect.

240
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,729
Uh-huh.

241
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:19,647
>> It's over.

242
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,857
Hallelujah, praise the Lord.

243
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,525
Amen, Jesus!

244
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,734
After three days of being a

245
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,112
loser when I first got here,

246
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,405
I'm proud of myself.

247
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,532
I formed an amazing alliance.

248
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,867
It's really quite brilliant.

249
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,742
We're going to take over the

250
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,411
whole world.

251
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,538
That's right.

252
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:47,550
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

253
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,593
Timbira getting your first look

254
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:49,552
at the new Jalapao tribe.

255
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,511
Sandy voted out at the last

256
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,430
Tribal Council.

257
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,308
>> Only a matter of time.

258
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,933
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

259
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,476
to today's challenge?

260
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,352
>> Yeah!

261
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,061
>> PROBST: Today's challenge

262
00:07:59,145 --> 00:07:59,645
will be played in rounds.

263
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,315
Each round, one tribe member

264
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:02,899
will be seated on a spinning

265
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:03,733
platform.

266
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,651
On my "go," another tribe

267
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,569
member will race while pulling

268
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,654
a rope attached to that

269
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,655
platform, causing the tribe

270
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,575
member to get dizzy.

271
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,743
The dizzy tribe member must

272
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,494
then make their way across the

273
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,371
balance beam to the finish line.

274
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,414
Each time you win a round for

275
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:19,749
your tribe, you score a point.

276
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,459
First tribe to three points

277
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:21,792
wins a reward.

278
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:22,543
Want to know what you're

279
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,170
playing for?

280
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,004
>> Yeah!

281
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,005
>> PROBST: For today's reward,

282
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:26,964
you will be taken to the Charmin

283
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,216
Café...

284
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,300
>> Oh!

285
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,009
>> Oh, my God!

286
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:30,760
>> PROBST: ...where you will

287
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,386
enjoy some nice, strong coffee,

288
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,514
pastries.

289
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,139
You'll also have a modern toilet

290
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,683
and plenty of Charmin.

291
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,100
Worth playing for?

292
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,977
>> Yes!

293
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:40,978
>> PROBST: In addition, the

294
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,730
winning tribe will choose one

295
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:43,606
member of the losing tribe to

296
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,774
go to Exile.

297
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,193
That person will select

298
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:47,818
somebody from the winning tribe

299
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,779
to join them, which means one

300
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,406
person from the winning tribe

301
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,575
will not enjoy the Charmin Café.

302
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,409
>> Oh!

303
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:55,993
>> PROBST: Big stakes.

304
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,036
I'll give you a minute to

305
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:57,703
strategize.

306
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,830
Then we'll get started.

307
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:03,751
Here we go.

308
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,128
First round, for Jalapao, Joe

309
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,381
will be pulling Taj.

310
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:09,799
For Timbira, Brendan will be

311
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,467
pulling Tyson.

312
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,635
Survivors ready?

313
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,719
Go!

314
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,595
>> Come on, Joe!

315
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:19,558
>> Joe, you got this, Joe.

316
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,810
>> PROBST: Here they go!

317
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,144
Taj getting a spin.

318
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:22,645
Tyson getting a spin.

319
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,981
>> Come on, Brendan!

320
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:25,773
>> You got it, Joe.

321
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:26,941
You got it, Joe!

322
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,567
>> Hold on, Tyson, hold on.

323
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,527
>> PROBST: Joe and Brendan very

324
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,695
even.

325
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,238
Gotta get up and off while

326
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:32,822
you're dizzy.

327
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,199
>> Whoo, whoo!

328
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,034
>> PROBST: Taj giving it a go.

329
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:37,702

00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:38,077
>> Come on, Taj!

331
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,328
Come on, Taj!

332
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,289
>> Taj, come on!

333
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,039
>> I'm coming!

334
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:42,748
>> Hey, relax, Taj, relax.

335
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,417
>> Come on, Tyson.

336
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,293
Come on, baby.

337
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,085
>> PROBST: Tyson taking his

338
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,128
time.

339
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,462
If you fall off, you have to go

340
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,213
back.

341
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,089
>> Slow down, Taj, slow down,

342
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,591
Taj, slow down.

343
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,008
>> Oh, come on, Taj!

344
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,551
>> She's back at the start,

345
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,468
Tyson.

346
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,679
Take your time.

347
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,097
>> Hurry, hurry, hurry!

348
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,223
>> PROBST: We are neck and neck.

349
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,351
Tyson and Taj, both very close.

350
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,394
Tyson's across.

351
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:03,769
>> Yeah, baby!

352
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,604
Yeah, baby!

353
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,230

Timbira!

355
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:08,858
Timbira up 1-zip.

356
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,943
Playing to three.

357
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,611
Next round, Stephen will be

358
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,821

00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,073
Coach will be pulling Erinn.

360
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,575
Survivors ready?

361
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,909
Go!

362
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:19,869
>> You got this, boy!

363
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,287
>> Go, Stephen!

364
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,747

365
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,832
>> PROBST: Coach pulling Erinn.

366
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:25,750
Erinn really spinning.

367
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,253
Stephen pulling Spencer.

368
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,796
>> Oh!

369
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,756
>> Go, Erinn!

370
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,882
Erinn, off, off!

371

>> Go, Stephen, go, go!

372
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,886
Here we go.

373
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,471
>> Take your time, Erinn, take

374
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,180
your time.

375
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,723
>> Breathe, breathe.

376
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,682
>> Take your time.

377
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,892
>> Take a second.

378
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:43,392
>> Let it get off you.

379
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,935
Let it get off you.

380
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,103

381
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,438
>> Yeah, Spence!

382
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,773
Keep going, baby!

383
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:49,398
>> Take your time, Erinn, take

384
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,442
your time.

385
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,568
>> He's off! He's off!

386
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:53,652
>> PROBST: Erinn with a big lead

387
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,987
if she can hang on.

388
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:55,821
She doesn't.

389
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:56,155
>> She's off.

390
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,365
>> Come on, Spencer!

391
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,157
>> PROBST: Spencer now with a

392
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,824
shot.

393
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,034
>> Come on, Spence!

394
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:00,910
>> Look at those steady little

395
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:01,911
legs!

396
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,204
>> Whoa!

397
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:03,746
>> PROBST: Spencer's across!

398
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,415
>> PROBST: Jalapao wins!

399
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,833
Jalapao evens it up, 1-1.

400
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:08,751
>> That was like beer goggles,

401
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,169
man.

402
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,213
>> PROBST: Next round, Joe will

403
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:12,713

404
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:16,133
Brendan will be spinning Sierra.

405
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:16,801
Survivors ready?

406
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,928
Go.

407
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:19,720
>> Joe and Brendan dead even.

408
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:20,930
Big sprints.

409
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,973
>> Hold on, Sierra.

410
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:23,891
Hold on.

411
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:24,809
>> Atta boy, Joe.

412
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:25,768
>> PROBST: J.T. spinning.

413
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,520
Sierra is flying.

414
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,104
>> Hold on, hold on, hold on,

415
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,230
hold on.

416
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:29,647
>> You got it, Joe.

417
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,272
You got it, Joe.

418
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:30,731
>> Good job.

419
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:31,565
>> Sierra!

420
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,942
>> Breathe, breathe, breathe.

421
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:33,734
Breathe.

422
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,069
You're okay. You're okay.

423
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:35,403
>> Focus, J.!

424
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,862
>> PROBST: J.T. trying to get

425
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:37,822
rid of that dizziness.

426
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,116
Like the end of a bad Friday

427
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,534
night for J.T.

428
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,076
Sierra struggling with the

429
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,661
dizziness.

430
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,079
Take your time, girl.

431
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,664
>> You got it, J.T.

432
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:47,081
Give it a go, J.T.

433
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,624
Give it a go.

434
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:49,125
>> Come on, girl.

435
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:49,875
You got this.

436
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,627
>> Take your time, Sierra.

437
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,128
>> PROBST: J.T. falls off

438
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,547
quickly, Sierra with the early

439
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,131
lead.

440
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:55,506
>> He's way back.

441
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:56,215
Take your time.

442
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:56,966
>> He's not even on it.

443
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,676
>> Relax, J.T., relax.

444
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,429
Use your arms to balance.

445
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,430
>> PROBST: She can't hang on.

446
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,431
Sierra's off.

447
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,182
J.T. nearly across.

448
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,517
J.T. is across.

449
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,519
Jalapao wins round three.

450
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,979
Jalapao leads 2-1.

451
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,440
Playing to three.

452
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,775
Next round, Stephen pulling

453
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:14,984
Sydney.

454
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,653
Coach pulling Debra.

455
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:19,488
Timbira, got to win this round

456
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,489
to stay alive.

457
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,451
Jalapao wins, you win reward.

458
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,202
Survivors ready?

459
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:25,369
Go.

460
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,704
>> Let's go, Stephen!

461
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:27,705
>> PROBST: This is it, Timbira's

462
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:27,997
last chance.

463
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,373
>> Coach, you got this!

464
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,000
>> Go, Steve-o, go, Steve-o, go!

465
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,960
>> Atta boy, Steve-o!

466
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:33,252
>> Come on!

467
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,587
Stephen, you're beating him,

468
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:34,795
baby!

469
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,046
>> Atta boy, Stephen!

470
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,174
Come on!

471
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,802
>> PROBST: This is it.

472
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,220
Both women are free.

473
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:43,804
>> Come on, Syd.

474
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,890
>> Take a breather.

475
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,433
>> Come you, you little

476
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:47,808
ballerina.

477
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:48,809
>> PROBST: Debbie up on the

478
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,979
balance beam first.

479
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,147
>> Come on, Debbie!

480
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,648
>> PROBST: Sydney making quick

481

work of the first half of the

482
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:56,108
balance beam.

483
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,985
>> Come on, Syd.

484
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,362
>> PROBST: Sydney almost, but

485
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,322
not enough.

486
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,698
Debbie can tie things up for

487
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:03,908
Timbira if she hangs on.

488
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,660
Sydney hustling to catch Debbie.

489
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,328
>> Hurry, Deb.

490
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,037
>> Go, Deb!

491
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,497

492
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,664

>> PROBST: Sydney is across!

495
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,420
Jalapao wins reward at The

496
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,964
Charmin Café.

497
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,841
Jalapao, congratulations.

498
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,551
Nice afternoon awaiting you

499
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,219
guys.

500
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:23,844
Let's get down to the business

501
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:24,887
at hand.

502
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,722
Who are you going to choose

503
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:27,264
from Timbira to go to Exile

504
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:27,932
Island?

505
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,725
>> We're going to send Brendan

506
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:30,267
again.

507
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,685
>> Brendan going back to Exile

508
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:32,770
Island for Timbira.

509
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,188
You're smiling.

510
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,397
>> It's evil to be able to pick

511
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,482
somebody that just won a reward

512
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,650
and take them out of it.

513
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:38,317
>> PROBST: All right, Brendan,

514
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,109
who are you choosing from

515
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:39,860
Jalapao to go with you?

516
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,779
>> Stephen.

517
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:42,655
>> What?

518
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,157
>> I love you.

519
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,242
>> Oh...

520
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:46,992
>> Brendan, that was a classy

521
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,869
move, man.

522
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,789
That was classy, dude.

523
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:52,414
>> I don't know what's going on

524
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,750
in Brendan's head, but, uh, he's

525
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,168
made a lot of contact with the

526
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,419
other tribe.

527
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,255
Whether he's built up

528
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,631
friendships or alliances,

529
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:01,340
I don't know.

530
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,425
But, uh, he definitely seems to

531
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,969
have some of their respect, and

532
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,972
it could get dangerous.

533
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,056
>> PROBST: Jalapao,

534
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:09,932
congratulations.

535
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:10,266
Grab your stuff.

536
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,392
Head out.

537
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,059
>> Enjoy.

538
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,018
Have some for us.

539
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:13,602
>> PROBST: You guys have a fun

540
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,979
afternoon in store.

541
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:44,925
The Charmin Café is waiting.

542
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,010
>> The Charmin Café.

543
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,803
>> Charmin.

544
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:48,721
>> Yay!

545
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:49,805
>> I like Charmin.

546
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:50,180
>> That's awesome.

547
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,141
>> Aww.

548
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,809
>> Oh, my God!

549
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:54,643
>> We can lay down after we eat.

550
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,020
>> Oh, my God!

551
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,146
>> What are these?

552
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,732
>> Oh, my God!

553
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:00,190
>> Oh, my God, y'all.

554
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,109
>> Who wants one of these?

555
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,193
>> I want one of everything.

556
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:03,986
>> I want everything.

557
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,655
>> This is so good.

558
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,907
>> I was very excited to go on a

559
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:09,867
reward because every time we

560
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,702
win the reward challenge, I end

561
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,996
up going to Exile, every time.

562
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,497
I'm going to eat until I hurt.

563
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,165
>> Mm-hmm.

564
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,291
>> All that food.

565
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,167
All the coffee and the juice

566
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,085
and the fresh water.

567
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,962
I didn't know what to do.

568
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:22,338
I forgot my name.

569
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,172
I was just going crazy.

570
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,466
I was so happy.

571
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,550
>> Look over there.

572
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,134
>> A potty!

573
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,010
>> With soap.

574
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:31,972
There's soap over there!

575
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:32,556
>> I'll take this over fishing

576
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,058
gear any day.

577
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:34,350
>> Oh, yeah.

578
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,018
>> It's cool getting to know my

579
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,728
tribe because every time you

580
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:38,354
go to Exile, you just separate

581
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,063
yourself from the tribe.

582
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,607
But I'm not really worried

583
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,609
about that because there's a

584
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,235
whole 'nother story going on

585
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,987
with the secret alliance that no

586
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:47,446
one even knows about.

587
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,907
So, since I do have a plan B,

588
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,908
I don't feel so nervous.

589
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,785
You spun me around like a damn

590
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,412
tornado.

591
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,081
>> I think Taj being gone all

592
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,624
this time really hurts her.

593
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,084
All the rest of us, we've been

594
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,126
able to really kind of gain

595
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,253
some trust with each other, and

596
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,047
even talk strategy, and she

597
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,048
hasn't had the opportunity to

598
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,718
create a tighter bond.

599
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:10,135
>> Hey, you guys!

600
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,388
>> What's over there?

601
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,514
>> Oh, cool!

602
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:14,014
What is it?

603
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:14,348
>> What is it?

604
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,725
>> I don't know what it is.

605
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:17,559
>> Is that a menu?

606
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,268
>> Maybe it's a gift

607
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:18,769
certificate.

608
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,104
>> Oh, my God!

609
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,273
>> Oh, my God.

610
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,274
What is this?

611
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,150
>> No way, dude.

612
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,360
>> Oh, it is a letter.

613
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:26,652
Oh, my God!

614
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,070
>> From my family.

615
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:28,904
>> Oh!

616
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:30,072
>> Yeah!

617
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:30,322
>> No way!

618
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:34,284
(squeals)

619
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,203
>> I'm so happy!

620
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:36,995
>> No way!

621
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,080
"Everybody misses you like

622
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,500
crazy."

623
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,461
>> My mom would write two pages.

624
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,880
>> J.T. found letters from home,

625
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,424
and it was not something that we

626
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,216
expected.

627
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,259
And it was definitely the most

628
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,386
important reward we've had so

629
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,929
far, as far as just for mental

630
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:54,179
strength.

631
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,557
>> Aw...

632
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,224
>> To have that reminder that,

633
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,267
hey, your family is at home

634
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,601
waiting for you.

635
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,686
There is something outside the

636
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,062
game.

637
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:05,399
>> Oh, man.

638
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,818
>> All my nieces gave me

639
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:08,819
something.

640
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,196
>> Oh, this is good, man.

641
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,448
(crying)

642
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,700
>> Oh, my gosh.

643
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:16,577
>> I know, y'all.

644
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:16,827
>> Sorry.

645
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,412
>> Tears of joy.

646
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,705
It's the first time my dad's

647
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,415
ever said something like,

648
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,958
"Be careful and be safe."

649
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:26,628
>> She said it there?

650
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,921
>> She told me at the end.

651
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,757
I almost started crying.

652
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,175
>> Yeah, I almost lost it there

653
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:31,383
for...

654
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,343
>> Oh, God.

655
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,887
Being out here for so long, you

656
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,096
almost forget what home is like

657
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,306
and what the people are like

658
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,683
that you love and to get a

659
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,643
letter, and to just hear them

660
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,686
tell you that they miss you and

661
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,437
they're proud of you and they

662
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,062
just...

663
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:44,229
Oh!

664
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,856
That was just the icing on the

665
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:46,064
cake.

666
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,524
I would have been sick if I had

667
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,068
to go to Exile and miss that.

668
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,784
>> This is not much for us to

669
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:57,326
eat, you know.

670
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,286
>> Out of all the challenges so

671
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,788
far, I wanted that one the most.

672
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,081
>> Mm-hmm.

673
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,546
>> Yeah.

674
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,604
>> Yeah.

675
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:26,855
Brendan right now, the way he's

676
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,315
going to Exile, and the people

677
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,150
that he's choosing for Exile,

678
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,694
is making strong allies.

679
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,406
If we merge, he has control of

680
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,617
the game, and I'm a bystander.

681
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,243
And I certainly don't want that

682
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,370
to happen.

683
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,293
Feel the breeze shift?

684
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,174
I've noticed that the wind

685
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:57,219
blows this way predominantly.

686
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:57,719
But when there's a storm

687
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,721
coming, it switches directions.

688
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,973
It turns this way.

689
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,182
But it doesn't look too crazy

690
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,183
because it looks like the

691
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:03,767
clouds are breaking up on the

692
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,435
horizon.

693
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,986
(thunder rumbles)

694
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,076
>> Oh, my gosh.

695
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:22,744
Coach is kind of a jackass.

696
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,163
He's been running his mouth

697
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,789
about the weather at camp.

698
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,374
I think Coach really, truly

699
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,667
wants to be this, like,

700
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,669
"Survivor Man."

701
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:38,093
I would not be surprised if,

702
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:40,512
when this game is all said and

703
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,390
done, Coach said, "Gotcha!

704
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,017
I'm an accountant.

705
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,144
I've never left Nebraska."

706
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,027
>> So, uh, this is your

707
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,737
Brazilian hideaway?

708
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,907
>> This is my vacation pad.

709
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,992
>> It's-it's quite stunning.

710
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:03,327
>> Yeah.

711
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:03,660
>> Okay, cool.

712
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,286
So this will be fun.

713
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,954
>> Yeah.

714
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:06,705
>> Awesome.

715
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:07,289
Awesome, awesome, awesome.

716
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,208
I picked Stephen to go to Exile

717
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,877
in order to put the final piece

718
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,377
of the puzzle in place.

719
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,880
He didn't know me, didn't know

720
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,007
Sierra, so I'm really excited

721
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,133
to catch up with him about,

722
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:19,176
you know, how we could work

723
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,136
together, just to make him feel

724
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:22,471
comfortable with that alliance.

725
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,555
So this is the view from the

726
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,348
top.

727
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:24,640
>> Oh, man.

728
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,265
Oh, wow.

729
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,433
>> It's pretty, right?

730
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,768
>> It is.

731
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:28,644
>> It's crazy.

732
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,269
It's like an oasis.

733
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,437
>> We've got the hidden immunity

734
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,396
idol.

735
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,981
>> You brought it with you?

736
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:33,357
>> Yeah.

737
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,191
>> Oh, nice.

738
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:34,942
You guys actually have it.

739
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:35,359
>> Yeah.

740
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:35,984
>> I was concerned she didn't

741
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:36,818
have it.

742
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,320
>> No. We got it this morning.

743
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,029
>> You did?

744
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:39,488
>> Yeah.

745
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,948
>> When Stephen and I first

746
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,491
arrived, we started talking

747
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,451
immediately, and he told me that

748
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,911
he had the hidden immunity idol.

749
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,412
I told him I had also had found

750
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,247
the idol, so now this

751
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,415
four-person alliance has both

752
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,167
immunity idols, which is great

753
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,543
because it's going to put us in

754
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,378
a powerful spot.

755
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:54,628
>> Yeah.

756
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,463
So, there's more wood.

757
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,297
We should probably just go grab

758
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,466
more big trunks like that and

759
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:00,467
load up for tonight.

760
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,844
>> Cool.

761
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:03,762
Brendan.

762
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:04,346
My first impression of him is

763
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,391
positive, but wary.

764
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,142
He's obviously an extremely

765
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,060
strong player.

766
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,770
He's mentally strong and he's

767
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,188
clearly strategically strong.

768
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:14,690
But, you know, it's hard to

769
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,233
trust someone who...

770
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:16,817
You know, I've known him for

771
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,026
five minutes.

772
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,194
I can't place my entire faith in

773
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:19,528
the game on him.

774
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,488
So, I might keep this two-tribe

775
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,490
alliance in the back of my head

776
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,533
as something that might be

777
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,867
there, but I can't place my

778
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:26,702
entire faith on this

779
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,829
four-person alliance.

780
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,428
>> I had a crazy dream last

781
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,971
night.

782
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:46,722
>> About what?

783
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,140
>> My boyfriend, Kelly.

784
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,642
He had, like, a salsa...

785
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,311
a, like, chips and salsa thing

786
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,647
in his hand as this earthquake

787
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:56,523
was going on.

788
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,567
It was just really strange.

789
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,694
But it was nice to see Kelly.

790
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,029
>> Right.

791
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:02,654
>> I woke up.

792
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:03,822
I'm like, "I have to marry this

793
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,240
guy."

794
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:06,825
I can't live without this guy."

795
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,619
So, no girls to whet your

796
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,621
appetite?

797
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,665
No one does it for you?

798
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,042
>> None, uh...

799
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:15,459
None right now.

800
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,835
There are a lot of cute girls at

801
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:17,502
U.F., though.

802
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,170
>> Yeah?

803
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,796
>> A lot of them, yeah.

804
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,672
I'm not in a rush.

805
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,590
There's, there are those people

806
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,799
who just need to be in a

807
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:23,133
relationship.

808
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:23,717
They just need to have that

809
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,718
person.

810
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:25,844
I'm like, I'm not one of those

811
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:26,720
people.

812
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:26,928
>> Yeah.

813
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,972
>> So I don't know.

814
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:29,473
>> It's nice to be free.

815
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,849
>> Yeah.

816
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:31,975
>> Especially at your age.

817
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,644
>> Feel like that's pretty cool.

818
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,396
My tribe mates are not aware

819
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:36,730
that I'm gay.

820
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,066
I haven't told them, only

821
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,068
because I feel like, in the

822
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,069
culture that we live in,

823
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,570
there's nothing really to gain,

824
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,238
or not much to gain, by people

825
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:45,822
finding out that you are gay.

826
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,824
I figure, I've got time in the

827
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:48,533
future.

828
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,159
I'm not getting married anytime

829
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:49,868
soon.

830
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:50,869
>> Gosh, all you have is time.

831
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,497
>> I know, so...

832
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,456
I don't like hiding it, though.

833
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,791
I would like to be able to have

834
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,708
those conversations.

835
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:57,959
When we're talking about girls,

836
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,336
I-I wouldn't mind, you know,

837
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:00,420
making like, "Spencer, what type

838
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,588
of guy do you like?" or

839
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:02,255
something.

840
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:02,839
But I know that that's not the

841
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,633
best option for me in the game

842
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,301
at this point, so...

843
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:09,679
>> Tree mail!

844
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,139
"Connecting with your tribe

845
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,641
will keep you alive.

846
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,475
Battling the others is part of

847
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,476
the game.

848
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,145
The meek and the slow will lose

849
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:17,604
one more.

850
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,898
The aggressive protect their

851
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:20,857
flame."

852
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:21,983
>> "Connecting with your tribe."

853
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,944
>> "Connecting with your tribe."

854
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,029
>> Guys like J.T., typical

855
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,322
Southerners, you know, people

856
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,116
who are generally not quite as

857
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,535
accepting of homosexuality, and

858
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,828
I don't know if he's one of

859
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,496
those guys, but they are maybe

860
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,540
inclined to get rid of somebody

861
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:37,874
like me just based on fact that

862
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:38,750
I am gay.

863
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,168
>> This is definitely my kind

864
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:40,627
of game right here.

865
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,838
I can catch and throw anything.

866
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:43,672
>> And that's disappointing.

867
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,298
And it's one of the reasons why

868
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,467
I keep it a secret.

869
00:23:53,932 --> 00:24:06,736
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

870
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,487
We'll now bring in Brendan and

871
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,447
Stephen, returning from Exile

872
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,741
Island.

873
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:14,953
>> Welcome back.

874
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,580
>> What's up, Stevie?

875
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:16,872
>> Hello.

876
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:20,125
>> Oh.

877
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,168
You need some water?

878
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:21,543
>> Awesome.

879
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,586
>> PROBST: Guys ready to get to

880
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:23,003
today's challenge?

881
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:23,837
>> Yeah.

882
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,337
>> PROBST: First things

883
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,339
first; Debbie, give it up.

884
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:29,801
>> I missed you guys.

885
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:30,635
>> PROBST: Once again, immunity

886
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,637
is back up for grabs.

887
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,015
For today's challenge, two

888
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,349
members of each tribe will

889
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,226
alternate launching balls out

890
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,727
onto the course, where the

891
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,979
remaining tribe members will

892
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,606
catch the ball.

893
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:43,732
It doesn't matter what color

894
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:44,024
the ball is.

895
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,567
You catch a ball from either

896
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,152
tribe, you score a point for

897
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,111
your tribe.

898
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,238
First tribe to five wins

899
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:50,989
immunity.

900
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:54,159
Losing tribe, Tribal Council,

901
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:54,784
where somebody will be voted out

902
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,078
of this game.

903
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,371
Worth playing for?

904
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:58,580
>> Yeah!

905
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,664
>> PROBST: All right, give you

906
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:00,165
a minute to strategize.

907
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:03,501
We'll get started.

908
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,464
Here we go.

909
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,049
The launchers for Jalapao:

910
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:09,633
Sydney and Stephen.

911
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:13,220
For Timbira: Erinn and Debbie.

912
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:13,637
Guarding each other:

913
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,597
Brendan and Taj;

914
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,724
Coach and Joe;

915
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,392
Spencer and Tyson;

916
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,311
Sierra and J.T.

917
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,938
It's first to five.

918
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,564
Survivors ready?

919
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:27,984
Three, two, one, launch!

920
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,444
Erinn goes short over to

921
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,071
Brendan, who just misses.

922
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,072
>> J.T.!

923
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,198
>> PROBST: Sydney goes deep to

924
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,282
J.T.

925
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,992
J.T. with a great snag for

926
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:36,660
Jalapao!

927
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:36,910
>> J.T.!

928
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,161
>> Yeah!

929
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,287
>> PROBST: Jalapao on the board

930
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,039
with their first point.

931
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,415
Okay, here we go.

932
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,917
Next round.

933
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,628
Three, two, one, launch.

934
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:49,798
Debbie goes deep.

935
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,217
Stephen goes deep.

936
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:52,676
>> Wow!

937
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:53,969
>> PROBST: J.T. with another

938
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,220
great catch!

939
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:55,679
Joe!

940
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:56,054
>> In his hand.

941
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:58,515
>> PROBST: In and out, in and

942
00:25:58,598 --> 00:25:59,516
out.

943
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,226
Does not count.

944
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,061
Got to catch it in the net.

945
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,646
J.T. snags one for Jalapao.

946
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,898
We are now at 2-zip.

947
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,109
>> Oh, boy.

948
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:12,737
>> PROBST: Here we go.

949
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,657
Three, two, one, launch.

950
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,158
Erinn and Sydney both release

951
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,368
their balls.

952
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:18,910
Brendan with a nice stab.

953
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:22,289
J.T. just misses.

954
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:23,957
Timbira on the board now with

955
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,958
their first point.

956
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,293
>> All right, Brendan!

957
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,712
>> PROBST: Jalapao leads 2-1.

958
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:29,879
>> Let's go, guys.

959
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:30,714
>> PROBST: Three, two, one,

960
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,841
launch.

961
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,968
Both balls in the air.

962
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,806
Brendan with a great snag for

963
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:42,350
Timbira.

964
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,020
We are now at 2-2.

965
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,104
>> Taj, come on, baby.

966
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,731
>> Hey, I am doing my best.

967
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:50,108
>> PROBST: Taj is wearing down.

968
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:50,817
That's giving Brendan a big

969
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,777
opening.

970
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,237
Here we go.

971
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:58,074
Three, two, one, launch.

972
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,826
Both balls in the air.

973
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,873
J.T. snags another one for

974
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,499
Jalapao!

975
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,878
>> Oh, he knocked a tooth.

976
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:10,712
>> We've got a tooth out.

977
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:11,963
>> He just lost a tooth.

978
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,089
>> PROBST: Ah.

979
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,258
J.T. has lost a tooth.

980
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:15,508
>> J.T.!

981
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,968
>> PROBST: Wait, J.T., did you

982
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,054
just throw it?

983
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,141
>> PROBST: Let's find the tooth.

984
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,184
Let's find the tooth.

985
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:24,893
You're going to want that tooth.

986
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,728
>> It's only half of it.

987
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,064
>> I-I didn't see him get hit.

988
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,566
>> Is that it?

989
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:32,901
You want this back, J.T.?

990
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:33,443
>> No, it-it don't matter.

991
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,069
>> PROBST: Here, I'll hold it.

992
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,696
Give it to me.

993
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:36,988
(Taj groans)

994
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,074
>> Oh, my God.

995
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,658
(Sydney exhales sharply)

996
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:41,951
>> Are you bleeding, J.T.?

997
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,287
You all right, man?

998
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,497
>> PROBST: For the first time

999
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,581
ever in the history of

1000
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,583
<i>Survivor,</i> a point was scored

1001
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,085
while losing a tooth.

1002
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,545
We are now at 3-2.

1003
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,463
Jalapao leads.

1004
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:54,172
Here we go.

1005
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:57,550
Three, two, one, launch.

1006
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,594
Both balls in the air.

1007
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,012
Tyson almost snags it for

1008
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:01,930
Timbira.

1009
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:02,806
>> Yeah, J.T.!

1010
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:03,765
>> PROBST: J.T., unbelievable!

1011
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:07,477
Another catch for Jalapao!

1012
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:07,894
>> Yeah, J.T.!

1013
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:11,356
>> PROBST: We are now at 4-2.

1014
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,108
Jalapao needs just one more

1015
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,651
point to win.

1016
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:15,652
>> Yeah!

1017
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:15,944
We got this.

1018
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,862
>> PROBST: Three, two, one,

1019
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,739
launch.

1020
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,032
>> Get it, Spencer!

1021
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,034
>> Come on, Spence!

1022
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,203
>> PROBST: Tyson, nice grab for

1023
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,121
Timbira.

1024
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,080
>> Tyson!

1025
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:27,914
>> Come on, Spence.

1026
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,457
>> PROBST: Tyson keeps Timbira

1027
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,166
alive.

1028
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,167
>> Yeah, Tyson!

1029
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,545
>> PROBST: Jalapao leads 4-3.

1030
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:34,462
>> Let it go, Spence.

1031
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,630
Let's do this.

1032
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,549
>> PROBST: Three, two, one,

1033
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:40,260
launch.

1034
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,928
Debbie short, Stephen long.

1035
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,888
>> Get it, Spence!

1036
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,682
>> PROBST: Tyson right there!

1037
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,434
Tyson snags another one for

1038
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,144
Timbira!

1039
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,192
>> Let's go, Tyson.

1040
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,283
>> PROBST: Jalapao's lead has

1041
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:03,908
evaporated.

1042
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:07,412
We're now tied 4-4, playing to

1043
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:07,829
five.

1044
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,498
Whoever scores the next point

1045
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,584
wins immunity.

1046
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,252
>> They want them shorter, yeah.

1047
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,003
>> Here we go, guys.

1048
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,838
Here we go, guys.

1049
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,339
>> PROBST: Three...

1050
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,299
>> Short, short!

1051
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,009
>> PROBST: ...two, one, launch.

1052
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,970
Erinn goes short.

1053
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,763
Sydney goes deep.

1054
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,057
Tyson scores for Timbira!

1055
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,727
J.T. just misses for Jalapao.

1056
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,270
Timbira wins immunity!

1057
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,397
(women shrieking)

1058
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,858
(J.T. grunts)

1059
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,029
>> Good job, guys.

1060
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,617
>> Good job.

1061
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,701
>> My man!

1062
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:50,038
Mwah!

1063
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,080
>> PROBST: Timbira,

1064
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,333
congratulations, immunity again.

1065
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:53,666
>> Thank you.

1066
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,003
>> Thank you.

1067
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,213
>> PROBST: No Tribal Council,

1068
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:58,922
nobody going home.

1069
00:29:59,005 --> 00:29:59,964
Grab your stuff.

1070
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:00,340
Head back camp.

1071
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:03,176
Have a good night.

1072
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,178
>> Good job, y'all.

1073
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:08,640
>> Great job, J.T.

1074
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,475
>> PROBST: J.T., amazing effort,

1075
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,101
almost single-handedly won that

1076
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,770
challenge for Jalapao.

1077
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,230
Instead, you came up short.

1078
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,940
The only thing I have for you

1079
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,608
is your tooth.

1080
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,281
Tribal Council tonight, Jalapao.

1081
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,032
Somebody going home.

1082
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:26,866
You have the afternoon to

1083
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,992
figure out who it's going to be.

1084
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:28,826
Grab your stuff.

1085
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,619
Head back to camp.

1086
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,412
See you at Tribal.

1087
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,789
>> I'm doing everything I can

1088
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:33,540
to win.

1089
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,165
Broke the back half of my front

1090
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,000
tooth off, but it just seemed

1091
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,168
like some people wasn't giving

1092
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:37,627
it all.

1093
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,920
I don't want to get rid of

1094
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,046
anyone, but it's got to be

1095
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,715
Spencer.

1096
00:30:49,931 --> 00:31:01,818
(birds chirping)

1097
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,194
>> I was hot today.

1098
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,113
I was so hot, I was exhausted.

1099
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,198
And I was hot meaning angry.

1100
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:07,949
Today's challenge frustrated me

1101
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,450
to no end.

1102
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,076
I just, I'm telling you, I just

1103
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,495
really felt like it was brutal.

1104
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:13,621
>> No, it's already scabbed up

1105
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,289
a little bit.

1106
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,207
>> Oh, yeah, it is swollen up

1107
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:16,958
around it.

1108
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:17,208
>> Yeah.

1109
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,960
>> Joe and J.T. got beat up bad.

1110
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:22,297
And I was angry because I fell

1111
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,214
short today.

1112
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,550
I think I'm a target, but I

1113
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:26,175
completely believe that they're

1114
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,761
crazy to keep Spencer over me

1115
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:29,345
if they're trying to keep the

1116
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,848
tribe strong because I think,

1117
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,017
uh, Spencer, his play today was

1118
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,311
far worse than anybody else's.

1119
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,565
We're only down one.

1120
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:41,149
I think whatever we need to do

1121
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,984
next needs to be the best

1122
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,902
chance to make it even, 5-5 at

1123
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:45,778
the merge.

1124
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:46,821
That means everybody needs to

1125
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:47,822
leave their little emotions out

1126
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:49,824
of it and think for the team.

1127
00:31:49,907 --> 00:31:50,783
Everybody.

1128
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,285
You, him, everybody.

1129
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,578
I'm-I'm hot today.

1130
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,621
So I don't give a ... what

1131
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:55,204
nobody thinks about me today.

1132
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:58,458
Everybody can kiss my ass.

1133
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,500
>> Can we talk through this

1134
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,084
thing?

1135
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,127
>> We can talk, but I just

1136
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:01,502
want it to be...

1137
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,170
I'm not going to sit here and

1138
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,671
talk bull.

1139
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,756
I'm not going to sit here and

1140
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:05,673
talk stuff, and then we do

1141
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:06,341
something different at Tribal

1142
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,175
Council.

1143
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,343
Do what's going to be best for

1144
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,178
the team.

1145
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,096
>> If it makes you feel any

1146
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,181
better, Taj, I trust you more

1147
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,474
than I do other people in the

1148
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:14,974
tribe.

1149
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:15,892
>> Well, thank you.

1150
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:19,771
>> Me, too.

1151
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,439
>> I trust you, for sure.

1152
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:22,315
>> You trust me?

1153
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:22,857
>> I trust everybody here.

1154
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,150
>> Why haven't you never come to

1155
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,234
me for an-an ally?

1156
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,444
Why have you never come to me

1157
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,236
like that?

1158
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,446
No, you've never come to me like

1159
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:28,655
that.

1160
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:29,197
You've never said to me and

1161
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,865
said, "Let's do this together"

1162
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:31,491
or "Let's try to..."

1163
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,242
You've never...

1164
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,952
>> It's a two-way road, right?

1165
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,579
>> Hey, I've tried to talk to

1166
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,205
you.

1167
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,289
I'm not attacking you.

1168
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,374
I'm just pissed today, and I'm

1169
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,502
sick of this game, sick of it.

1170
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,048
>> Taj was-was hot at me.

1171
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,925
I-I really don't know why.

1172
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:51,511
She can bat every eyelash and

1173
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:52,929
raise every feather that she

1174
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,514
has, but, you know, I think

1175
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:55,098
moves like that out here will

1176
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:58,643
get you voted off, bottom line.

1177
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:01,187
And if Taj has the idol, I

1178
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,147
think it's the best decision.

1179
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,024
>> I think she's just scared.

1180
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,234
I mean, you know, at least...

1181
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,360
she has an emotional outburst,

1182
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:10,405
but it's totally honest.

1183
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:17,412
What do you think?

1184
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,081
>> I have a really tough choice

1185
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,124
ahead tonight because,

1186
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,918
theoretically, I am better

1187
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:26,421
served by Taj going home

1188
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:29,173
without the idol because that

1189
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,384
means it's mine to keep,

1190
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,386
but right now, Taj, she's my

1191
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:34,846
real connection with the

1192
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:35,388
Timbira side of the Exile

1193
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,932
alliance, Brendan and Sierra.

1194
00:33:38,015 --> 00:33:40,059
So I'm not totally clear what

1195
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,186
I'm going to do.

1196
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,688
>> I'm just pissed off, man.

1197
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,857
I'm so pissed off.

1198
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,816
I feel like we just let that

1199
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,151
one go.

1200
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,485
It could very well possibly be

1201
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,737
it for me tonight, but I still

1202
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,237
have the immunity idol.

1203
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,322
And I have Steve kind of

1204
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:54,407
keeping an ear out for

1205
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,324
everything that's going on.

1206
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,868
He'll let me know if I really

1207
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:57,452
need to pull it out or not.

1208
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,786
They're down there

1209
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,871
whispering, so if you all want

1210
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,998
to get a piece, go ahead.

1211
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,128
>> Today's challenge was very

1212
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,589
frustrating because I'm a

1213
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,131
competitive person.

1214
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,841
And I hate not only to lose,

1215
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,843
but also to perform badly.

1216
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:14,302
And I knew that J.T.

1217
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,303
was probably going to be

1218
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,888
frustrated with me.

1219
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,931
>> I don't have any problem

1220
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,183
writing his name down because

1221
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,726
Spencer try and guess where it

1222
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:22,977
was going.

1223
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,394
That was obvious.

1224
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,146
He's not going to listen to

1225
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,147
what you tell him.

1226
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:26,689
He's going to do it his way.

1227
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:27,273
He wants everybody to do it

1228
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:28,816
his way.

1229
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,110
His way... you know.

1230
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,404
Whatever.

1231
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,114
I just want to win, man.

1232
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,116
>> We have to win now.

1233
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,163
>> Yeah, I hate losing.

1234
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,957
>> It's rough around camp.

1235
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,125
It's very, very tense.

1236
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,169
And it's scary for sure

1237
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:51,088
because things switch so

1238
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,423
quickly in this game.

1239
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,342
>> What do you think, Spencer?

1240
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,803
>> I figured you'd come back

1241
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:57,303
pissed at me, so...

1242
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,639
>> I was pissed at you,

1243
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:00,264
especially the challenge.

1244
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,308
>> You think I wasn't giving my

1245
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,392
effort?

1246
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,560
>> It didn't look like you

1247
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,353
tackled him.

1248
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,979
I said, "Tackle him."

1249
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,272
>> I knew I was probably going

1250
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,232
to be on the chopping block,

1251
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,316
so...

1252
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,192
>> I can't speak for the whole

1253
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,235
team.

1254
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,903
I'm just telling you how I

1255
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:14,529
feel, you know.

1256
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,530
>> I know, but, obviously, you

1257
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,782
have pull in the tribe, and...

1258
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,158
I feel like it would be

1259
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:22,286
beneficial to the tribe to keep

1260
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,288
me for the next immunity

1261
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:24,539
challenge.

1262
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,249
I feel... obviously, I want to

1263
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,918
stay, but I feel like I'm not

1264
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,336
the worst person to keep around.

1265
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,880
But that's...

1266
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:33,756
obviously up to the other five

1267
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,799
people who are voting, not just

1268
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,926
me.

1269
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,719
Who do you think should go?

1270
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:39,804
>> I don't know.

1271
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:40,304
>> You can tell me.

1272
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:43,432
>> I think you or Taj.

1273
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,874
>> PROBST: Let's talk about

1274
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:08,332
today's challenge.

1275
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,292
Spencer, how did you feel about

1276
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,669
your performance today?

1277
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,462
>> My performance today was

1278
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,172
pretty pathetic.

1279
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:15,798
I definitely felt like I let my

1280
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,341
guys down, and I was just very

1281
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,634
upset with myself just the whole

1282
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,177
time.

1283
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:20,761
>> PROBST: Taj, do you feel

1284
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:21,429
this tribe is still staying

1285
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,639
together well or, after a loss,

1286
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,641
can you feel the effect of

1287
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:26,475
losing?

1288
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,476
>> We can definitely feel the

1289
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,811
the effect of losing.

1290
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:29,395
And, of course, everybody's

1291
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,856
frustrated, so we're just

1292
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:32,481
trying to believe that the next

1293
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,317
challenge we'll be able to tie

1294
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,359
it up and go into the merge

1295
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,862
even, at least.

1296
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:38,779
>> PROBST: So how does that

1297
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,615
manifest itself back at camp?

1298
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,824
>> Well, initially, we all kind

1299
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,034
of blew up.

1300
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,160
Well, I won't say we all...

1301
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:44,744
I kind of blew up because I

1302
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,871
just felt like it was so

1303
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,331
mismatched that... I don't know,

1304
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,624
I just felt like we could have

1305
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:50,875
definitely done a better job,

1306
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:51,334
and I got upset.

1307
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,335
>> PROBST: Joe, what does it

1308
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,295
feel like to have somebody walk

1309
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,713
up and start attacking you?

1310
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:56,672
>> You don't ever like to walk

1311
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,341
into a room and have fingers

1312
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,342
pointed at you, especially when

1313
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,468
it's not necessarily

1314
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,427
even warranted.

1315
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,386
>> PROBST: Taj, does it worry

1316
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,304
you that you could have an

1317
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,806
outburst that could cost you in

1318
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:06,515
this game?

1319
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,642
>> Anything you do could cost

1320
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,643
you this game.

1321
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,269
So an outburst is just another

1322
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,520
form of anything that can

1323
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,980
happen to get you out of this

1324
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:13,773
game.

1325
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,398
And at that point, I felt like I

1326
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,734
was on my way out the door.

1327
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:17,652
>> PROBST: And what made feel

1328
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:18,819
that, your performance?

1329
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:19,946
>> You know what, I don't know,

1330
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,489
it's just a feeling you get that

1331
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,199
your head is next.

1332
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:23,824
And I was pissed off because,

1333
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,493
at every challenge, I do give

1334
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,620
110%, no matter if we lose or

1335
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,372
win, and to even have the idea

1336
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,666
that you're going to go out, and

1337
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,542
I'm trying to figure out why.

1338
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,460
I was hot.

1339
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:35,711
So whoever was there was going

1340
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:36,754
to get it, and I didn't care

1341
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,255
who.

1342
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:38,881
>> PROBST: Spencer, do you know

1343
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,216
what she's talking about in

1344
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,592
terms of just a gut: "People

1345
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:42,635
aren't talking to me the same

1346
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,553
way, or they're avoiding me."

1347
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,930
>> Absolutely.

1348
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,431
It definitely changes when you

1349
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,349
get back to camp, and you know

1350
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,351
that your head could be on the

1351
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,477
chopping block.

1352
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,896
Today, I had the same feeling

1353
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,939
because of my performance in

1354
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:55,856
the challenge and the

1355
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,066
frustration with J.T.

1356
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:58,109
during the challenge.

1357
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:58,651
I came back knowing that I

1358
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,403
could very well be going home

1359
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,570
tonight.

1360
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,030
It's not a feeling that is

1361
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,240
enjoyable, for sure.

1362
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,032
But I know what she's talking

1363
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,200
about, and I definitely felt it

1364
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:07,868
a bit today, too.

1365
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:08,953
>> PROBST: Taj, you've spent a

1366
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,579
lot of time out on Exile Island.

1367
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,580
>> That I have.

1368
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,164
>> PROBST: That can work two

1369
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,624
ways: you're gone so much,

1370
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:14,542
they don't have any reason to

1371
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,835
get rid of you; you're gone so

1372
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:16,460
much they don't know you, might

1373
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,503
as well get rid of her.

1374
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,463
>> Yeah, and, I mean, what can

1375
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,840
I do about it?

1376
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,508
I don't ask to go to Exile, so

1377
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,218
it's not like I had a choice.

1378
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:25,428
There's nothing I can do about

1379
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:26,721
it except for fit in when I

1380
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:27,513
come back.

1381
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:28,055
>> PROBST: Do you feel the

1382
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,515
target on your back, spending so

1383
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,726
much time away from the tribe?

1384
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,853
>> I didn't start feeling that

1385
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:36,147
until maybe this week, just

1386
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,773
because we're down to no more

1387
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,150
expendable people.

1388
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,735
I'm, like, that person, I

1389
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:41,986
guess, if they thought I had

1390
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,112
the idol, they didn't think I'd

1391
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,196
need to be here because,

1392
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,406
obviously, I would be a threat.

1393
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,033
>> PROBST: Joe, how do you deal

1394
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:47,575
with Taj, knowing she's been

1395
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,202
out there three times, a lot of

1396
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,454
opportunities to find the

1397
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:52,913
hidden immunity idol.

1398
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,206
>> You can't ever be certain.

1399
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:54,790
She could definitely have it.

1400
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,959
I haven't actually heard her

1401
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,419
say the words, "I do not have

1402
00:38:58,502 --> 00:38:59,503
the immunity idol."

1403
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,546
>> Would you like me to say it

1404
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:00,713
now?

1405
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:02,131
>> No, you don't have to.

1406
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,007
>> Okay.

1407
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,133
>> See, so stuff like that

1408
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:04,675
makes you think that she's

1409
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,385
really being aggressive about

1410
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,095
hiding this thing or lying

1411
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:08,679
about it if she does have it.

1412
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:09,513
>> If I did say something,

1413
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,556
would it mean I did had it.

1414
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:11,390
>> No, I'm just saying, little

1415
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,434
indicators like that,

1416
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,560
>> I can't win.

1417
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:15,603
>> So she hasn't slipped once,

1418
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,604
so I believe her.

1419
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,564
>> PROBST: And yet she still

1420
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:19,648
has not said she doesn't have

1421
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,524
it.

1422
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,650
>> You want to say it for me?

1423
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,401
>> I do not have the idol.

1424
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,111
>> Okay, see, I believe her.

1425
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,154
>> Should I say it to everyone

1426
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,447
here?

1427
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,158
>> I believe her.

1428
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:29,784
>> PROBST: And that is what it

1429
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,994
comes down to: whether or not

1430
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:32,620
you believe what the people in

1431
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,331
your tribe are telling you.

1432
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:36,290
Somebody is about to find out

1433
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:37,208
the truth.

1434
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,042
It is time to vote.

1435
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,294
Joe, you're up.

1436
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,430
>> I'm pretty sure it's either

1437
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,557
me or you tonight.

1438
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,699
>> You played a hell of a game

1439
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,201
and I'm sorry it came down to

1440
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,536
this.

1441
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:25,548
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1442
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:28,592
votes.

1443
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,017
If anybody has the hidden

1444
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:37,935
immunity idol and you want to

1445
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:38,519
play it, now would the time to

1446
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:41,981
do so.

1447
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,151
All right, once the votes are

1448
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,402
read, the decision is final.

1449
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,444
Person voted out will be asked

1450
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,195
to leave the Tribal Council

1451
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:48,571
area immediately.

1452
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,614
I'll read the votes.

1453
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:56,412
First vote: Spencer.

1454
00:40:59,081 --> 00:40:59,498
Taj.

1455
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:03,127
One vote Spencer; one vote Taj.

1456
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:05,713
Spencer.

1457
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,673
Two votes Spencer; one vote Taj.

1458
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,137
Spencer.

1459
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,930
That's three votes Spencer;

1460
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,057
one vote Taj.

1461
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:20,728

<i>Survivor: Tocantins:</i> Spencer.

1463
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,274
That's four votes.

1464
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:25,816
That's enough.

1465
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,527
You need to bring me your torch.

1466
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,367
Spencer, the tribe has spoken.

1467
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,412
Time for you to go.

1468
00:41:38,495 --> 00:41:40,539
>> Bye, guys.

two tribe members in a row.

1472

Worse than that, you lost

1473

momentum.

1474
00:41:58,891 --> 00:41:59,225
Grab your torches.

I lasted 15 days, but

they feel the same way.

00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,078
feel like as far as my attitude

1506
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,454
in tense situations.

1507
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,623
I'm going to work on that.
