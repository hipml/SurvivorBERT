1
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:04,134
Previously on Survivor...

2
00:00:05,134 --> 00:00:06,556
After a surprise mix...

3
00:00:06,681 --> 00:00:07,906
Throw away your bandanas!

4
00:00:08,031 --> 00:00:10,609
... Domenick was free 
from his worst enemy.

5
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:14,109
Chris was always after me. 
Getting away from him is a relief.

6
00:00:14,234 --> 00:00:16,470
And he was armed 
with a real idol, ...

7
00:00:16,595 --> 00:00:18,747
Oh my God !

8
00:00:18,872 --> 00:00:20,709
...of a false idol... 
Terrible!

9
00:00:20,834 --> 00:00:22,515
...and the Heir Advantage.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,309
"You can only use it when 
there are 13 or 6 people left in play."

11
00:00:27,434 --> 00:00:29,920
And Domenick controlled the vote.

12
00:00:30,045 --> 00:00:33,034
I have the choice 
of releasing Libby or Bradley.

13
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,670
At the council,

14
00:00:35,795 --> 00:00:39,009
Domenick made his choice 
and broke the divisions by tribes.

15
00:00:39,134 --> 00:00:40,816
Bradley, the tribe has spoken.

16
00:00:43,434 --> 00:00:44,662
There are 13 left.

17
00:00:44,787 --> 00:00:46,534
Who will be eliminated tonight?

18
00:01:01,634 --> 00:01:03,839
This morning we received a message saying

19
00:01:03,987 --> 00:01:07,297
that we had reached a new 
phase of the game. Fusion!

20
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,927
Reach the point 
where we're all together

21
00:01:11,052 --> 00:01:13,309
and where the game becomes individual,

22
00:01:13,434 --> 00:01:15,934
it's a real accomplishment.

23
00:01:16,706 --> 00:01:19,247
Now 
my efforts to bond

24
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:21,409
during the mixes, will pay.

25
00:01:21,534 --> 00:01:24,006
I wish I could 
do some damage!

26
00:01:28,634 --> 00:01:30,509
Yes ! 
Seriously ?!

27
00:01:30,634 --> 00:01:32,438
What's going on ?!

28
00:01:38,134 --> 00:01:39,209
Welcome !

29
00:01:39,334 --> 00:01:42,909
As soon as they arrived, I was happy 
to see my friend Wendell.

30
00:01:43,034 --> 00:01:46,138
It's good to have a reasonable and intelligent interlocutor .

31
00:01:46,298 --> 00:01:47,577
Older sister !

32
00:01:47,702 --> 00:01:50,109
And then there's Chris, 
my nemesis.

33
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:51,709
He refuses to leave.

34
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:55,391
But I hope he doesn't want 
to kill me at this stage of the game.

35
00:01:55,534 --> 00:01:59,015
"Gather all 
of you on the other side of the island,

36
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,055
a celebration awaits you there."

37
00:02:07,134 --> 00:02:11,609
This stage of the game represents... 
the hope that I can win.

38
00:02:11,734 --> 00:02:14,649
Being 18, wanting to be 
the youngest Survivor...

39
00:02:14,774 --> 00:02:16,609
It's been hard for me so far.

40
00:02:16,734 --> 00:02:19,352
So achieve fusion, 
and an idol in your pocket,

41
00:02:19,498 --> 00:02:21,109
for me, it's Christmas.

42
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:22,509
To eat !

43
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:24,489
Oh my God ! 
Oh yeah !

44
00:02:25,134 --> 00:02:27,160
I know it's gonna be the apocalypse

45
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:30,125
but for me, at this stage, 
we are all on equal terms.

46
00:02:30,277 --> 00:02:31,909
Thank you, Survivor gods!

47
00:02:32,034 --> 00:02:34,809
Everyone has a place at the table, 
at random.

48
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:37,809
At each seat: a black bandana.

49
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:40,336
We are a family,

50
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:44,473
but as soon as the feast is over, 
we will begin to devour each other.

51
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:47,034
I have something to say. 
Yeah !

52
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,001
I have been at Naviti Hotel 
since day one.

53
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:52,749
I cherish the new bonds 
I've made,

54
00:02:52,874 --> 00:02:55,417
but above all, I hope to strengthen

55
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,170
old relationships can 
no doubt be stronger.

56
00:02:59,295 --> 00:03:01,770
So play with the heart, 
that's the main thing!

57
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:02,809
Health !

58
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:05,834
I have high hopes 
for my second half.

59
00:03:06,044 --> 00:03:08,609
And apparently I have options.

60
00:03:08,734 --> 00:03:11,031
I have a four-way alliance 
with Donathan,

61
00:03:13,034 --> 00:03:15,804
I'm glad to see you. 
Me too.

62
00:03:16,054 --> 00:03:19,409
Bonus I can stick 
with the original Naviti

63
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:22,881
and have the majority. 
But Chris is too unpredictable.

64
00:03:23,006 --> 00:03:25,409
“Life is precious, 
use it.

65
00:03:25,564 --> 00:03:28,517
Like LeBron in the Finals, 
I will be relentless."

66
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,109
He's still a pain in the ass, sorry.

67
00:03:32,234 --> 00:03:34,254
So if I can get rid of it,

68
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,895
what I've been trying to do 
from the start,

69
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,534
That would take a hell of a weight off me.

70
00:03:46,086 --> 00:03:47,750
I feel really bad.

71
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:50,057
I got back to my original weight!

72
00:03:51,115 --> 00:03:54,710
I lay in the shelter, 
and I ate so much

73
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,146
I can barely move or speak.

74
00:03:57,294 --> 00:03:59,217
I put my bandana back on

75
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:01,834
and he looked different.

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,809
Something weird. Well.

77
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:06,090
I open it and it says:

78
00:04:06,215 --> 00:04:08,931
"Hush! A secret awaits 
at the mail tree."

79
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:11,109
Inside, I'm freaking out.

80
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:12,638
It's incredible.

81
00:04:12,763 --> 00:04:15,100
Anyone could have 
had this bandana.

82
00:04:15,225 --> 00:04:18,421
I am blessed ! This is exactly 
the remedy I needed!

83
00:04:19,234 --> 00:04:21,779
Now that we've merged, 
someone like me,

84
00:04:21,904 --> 00:04:25,600
athletic and good in trials, 
will be one of the first targets.

85
00:04:26,358 --> 00:04:30,209
I must be smart. 
People are walking everywhere.

86
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:33,048
I have to do this without everyone knowing.

87
00:04:33,234 --> 00:04:36,885
"Congratulations, you have found 
a clue for an idol,

88
00:04:37,034 --> 00:04:40,709
valid at the next council 
and maybe more.

89
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:42,334
But beware.

90
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:44,334
The idol is on Ghost Island.

91
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:46,850
Tonight, a boat 
will come to exfiltrate you

92
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,309
for a quick round trip 
to Ghost Island.

93
00:04:49,434 --> 00:04:52,633
Will you risk being seen 
to gain power?"

94
00:04:53,234 --> 00:04:54,334
And how !

95
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,809
All my life I have found success 
by taking risks.

96
00:04:58,934 --> 00:05:00,609
So I'm going to look for the idol.

97
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:03,312
At this point, you have to put the package.

98
00:05:03,534 --> 00:05:06,134
Especially when you're scary like me.

99
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:09,334
But at the same time, 
can I really get there?

100
00:05:09,534 --> 00:05:13,609
Leaving the island at night 
for hours is very risky.

101
00:05:13,734 --> 00:05:16,511
If I'm caught and questioned,

102
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,234
I'm fucked.

103
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:23,139
How does it feel, eight five,

104
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,077
Navigation contre Rest?

105
00:05:25,202 --> 00:05:27,759
Yes, but can we 
stay united between Naviti?

106
00:05:27,884 --> 00:05:30,209
Yes, you know... As long as...

107
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:34,509
My problem is to settle 
my conflict with Chris. Can we?

108
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:38,121
I'd like to mediate 
between you two. Calm the game.

109
00:05:38,246 --> 00:05:40,207
We had to do it before mixing.

110
00:05:40,332 --> 00:05:42,399
Especially if it's just for a vote.

111
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:46,909
Is there a Malolo 
we can all agree on?

112
00:05:47,034 --> 00:05:50,109
Probably on Michael or Libby. 
Yeah.

113
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:54,209
For this vote at least, I 
'd love it to be quiet Navitou

114
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:56,909
and we take out Michael or Libby.

115
00:05:57,034 --> 00:05:59,053
But alas, between Chris and Domenick,

116
00:05:59,178 --> 00:06:01,876
it's the cold war, 
the arms race.

117
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:05,434
And... These two can 
blow it all up if they want to.

118
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:10,331
I just wanted to yell at you, 
Dom and you, together,

119
00:06:10,456 --> 00:06:13,734
to see if we could 
target a common enemy.

120
00:06:14,297 --> 00:06:16,709
I love Dom. He is my ally.

121
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:20,180
Maybe I can find a way 
to be the bridge between them.

122
00:06:20,305 --> 00:06:23,009
Maybe I'll find out 
it's impossible

123
00:06:23,134 --> 00:06:25,134
and only 
the nuclear option remains.

124
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:28,234
Would you like... ? 
Dom, what are you talking about?

125
00:06:28,446 --> 00:06:32,709
All the time we've been here... 
All this...

126
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,678
Whatever it is, 
it goes back to day one.

127
00:06:35,803 --> 00:06:37,836
Absolutely. 
And that's unfortunate.

128
00:06:37,961 --> 00:06:40,709
Because the three of us 
could have collaborated.

129
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:44,409
For me, we could even 
collaborate temporarily.

130
00:06:44,534 --> 00:06:46,489
We can kill each other later

131
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,909
but right now, 
Chris, it's important.

132
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,634
Yeah, I don't know.

133
00:06:52,534 --> 00:06:54,911
If we can protect 
each other

134
00:06:55,036 --> 00:06:57,242
and fire someone...

135
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:59,934
I haven't decided anything at all yet.

136
00:07:00,078 --> 00:07:03,834
And those who are there? 
Would one of these three suit you?

137
00:07:04,534 --> 00:07:06,134
Any of them ?

138
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,592
Tell me. 
I don't know anyone yet.

139
00:07:08,717 --> 00:07:11,134
I just named three people.

140
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:15,210
But if you can't say yes... 
I can't.

141
00:07:15,346 --> 00:07:17,109
So no agreement is possible.

142
00:07:19,698 --> 00:07:22,234
I'm too sweet to walk.

143
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:25,109
They want to put me to sleep 
to kill me better.

144
00:07:25,234 --> 00:07:28,009
Do you have a mug for me? 
We open the wine!

145
00:07:28,134 --> 00:07:29,105
Go on !

146
00:07:29,374 --> 00:07:32,309
I left this thread 
as I entered it.

147
00:07:32,434 --> 00:07:34,970
There's been too much turbulence 
between Dom and me.

148
00:07:35,113 --> 00:07:38,700
So for me, I have to eliminate 
the one that threatens me the most.

149
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,771
I knew it would be 
ten minutes of anything.

150
00:07:42,934 --> 00:07:45,109
Let's organize his premature departure.

151
00:07:45,234 --> 00:07:46,534
Let's drink to that!

152
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,434
The talks 
came to an abrupt end.

153
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:52,531
I was ready to work with Chris,

154
00:07:52,656 --> 00:07:55,249
but finished the soft method. 
It's the war.

155
00:07:55,574 --> 00:07:57,153
To season 36!

156
00:08:23,065 --> 00:08:25,210
Domenick and Wendell 
want me gone.

157
00:08:25,335 --> 00:08:28,810
The only real protection for me 
is an immunity idol.

158
00:08:28,935 --> 00:08:30,864
And the idol is on Ghost Island.

159
00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:34,610
Sneaking away without getting caught 
is crucial.

160
00:08:34,942 --> 00:08:37,810
It was dark night, 
everyone crushed.

161
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,862
It was time 
to take action.

162
00:08:41,035 --> 00:08:44,310
Boots already on my feet, 
fully equipped, I was ready.

163
00:08:44,435 --> 00:08:47,406
But you gotta be smart, 
make sure you do that

164
00:08:47,552 --> 00:08:49,653
stealthily.

165
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,479
I live for these moments.

166
00:08:57,653 --> 00:09:00,035
Fortunately, I left unscathed.

167
00:09:00,265 --> 00:09:02,735
I'm pretty awesome, actually.

168
00:09:18,815 --> 00:09:20,769
Ghost Island 
is new to me.

169
00:09:20,931 --> 00:09:23,755
I came 
there but never arrived there at night.

170
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,235
Following these torches 
is a bit scary.

171
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,535
A little weird.

172
00:09:29,366 --> 00:09:33,213
But I'm ready to find out 
what fate has in store for me.

173
00:09:39,935 --> 00:09:43,258
"This is JT's authentic 
immunity idol

174
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,672
in Survivor Game Changers, 
in 2017."

175
00:09:49,212 --> 00:09:51,933
Great news. 
This idol will keep me in play.

176
00:09:52,183 --> 00:09:56,535
"He went to the council 
, leaving the idol at the camp.

177
00:09:57,009 --> 00:09:59,015
It was a bad decision." 
Damn!

178
00:09:59,157 --> 00:10:01,010
"That night he was eliminated."

179
00:10:01,135 --> 00:10:03,135
I made a very stupid mistake.

180
00:10:03,294 --> 00:10:05,508
I was a little overconfident.

181
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:09,274
"This tainted idol 
has lost some of its power.

182
00:10:09,635 --> 00:10:12,187
It is only valid 
at the next council."

183
00:10:12,437 --> 00:10:13,435
It's crazy.

184
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,005
Most idols, 
when you have them,

185
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,360
can be used 
whenever desired.

186
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,131
But this one is 
only good for the next tip.

187
00:10:21,256 --> 00:10:23,810
And then I read something else.

188
00:10:23,935 --> 00:10:26,435
"JT's idol is yours, 
safe.

189
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,510
But if you're willing to risk 
your vote at the next council,

190
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:32,810
you can increase its power."

191
00:10:32,935 --> 00:10:34,909
Alright, I'm intrigued.

192
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:37,810
"Whenever you choose 
the right bamboo,

193
00:10:37,935 --> 00:10:42,035
you will prolong 
the life of this idol with a council.

194
00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:47,447
You can do this up to 5 times, 
or until you lose your vote."

195
00:10:48,535 --> 00:10:51,313
So the game has ten bamboos, 
five on each side.

196
00:10:51,438 --> 00:10:53,361
One in two chance every time.

197
00:10:53,535 --> 00:10:57,499
"You can extend 
the life of this idol."

198
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:59,173
If I'm lucky.

199
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:01,210
But beware.

200
00:11:01,335 --> 00:11:03,745
If I play, it is also possible

201
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,710
that I cannot vote 
at the next council.

202
00:11:06,835 --> 00:11:10,345
It's crucial, because I'm trying 
to orchestrate Dom's elimination.

203
00:11:10,535 --> 00:11:12,480
I can win or lose.

204
00:11:15,835 --> 00:11:17,435
I start, clearly.

205
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,995
Taking risks 
is important in this game.

206
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,357
It's the only way to get to the end.

207
00:11:22,535 --> 00:11:24,410
Alright, let's go! Number one !

208
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:27,435
Survivor is not designed 
to take it easy.

209
00:11:30,135 --> 00:11:31,335
"Congratulation !

210
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,538
Your idol has gained power."

211
00:11:33,685 --> 00:11:34,903
Damn, yeah!

212
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:40,135
“She is now valid 
for one of the next two councils.

213
00:11:40,358 --> 00:11:42,235
Will you put your vote on the line?"

214
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:43,723
And how !

215
00:11:43,861 --> 00:11:45,010
Let's go on !

216
00:11:45,135 --> 00:11:47,748
I need 
as much power as possible,

217
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,635
as long as possible, 
in this game.

218
00:11:54,531 --> 00:11:55,608
"No voting."

219
00:11:57,735 --> 00:11:58,860
What a pity.

220
00:12:00,705 --> 00:12:01,837
No voting.

221
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:03,610
But it does not matter.

222
00:12:03,735 --> 00:12:06,310
I will not vote on this council,

223
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:08,603
but I have this idol,

224
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,210
usable 
at either of the next two tips.

225
00:12:11,335 --> 00:12:12,810
Thank you, Survivor gods!

226
00:12:12,935 --> 00:12:14,510
JT was too sure of himself.

227
00:12:14,635 --> 00:12:18,610
I don't want to be the one who leaves 
without having played his idol.

228
00:12:18,735 --> 00:12:21,035
I intend to 
reverse the curse.

229
00:12:21,232 --> 00:12:23,930
It will be in my pocket, 
ready to turn everything upside down.

230
00:12:35,936 --> 00:12:37,106
Lord !

231
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,128
Hot.

232
00:12:41,435 --> 00:12:43,338
Dom, is this coffee coming?

233
00:12:43,483 --> 00:12:44,935
He works hard !

234
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:49,710
Chris is grumpy and tired. 
God knows why.

235
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,254
But he has no problem 
barking orders

236
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:54,735
while he rests 
and perks up.

237
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,106
It's these little things 
that I don't understand about him

238
00:12:58,231 --> 00:12:59,650
and hurt me.

239
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:03,010
Oh, and let's not forget: 
he still wants to shoot me!

240
00:13:03,135 --> 00:13:04,410
It is enough for me.

241
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:06,423
Even though he was super cool,

242
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,097
this rascal wants me dead, 
he has to go.

243
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:12,000
This war, 
when will it end?

244
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,610
Ah, very soon!

245
00:13:13,938 --> 00:13:17,135
One of us is leaving. 
Very soon. Don't worry.

246
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:20,035
We have to annihilate idol.

247
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,910
I don't know who has it. 
Dom.

248
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,310
He showed it to me. 
Really ?

249
00:13:25,435 --> 00:13:29,910
I made the dumbest fake idol 
in the world.

250
00:13:30,035 --> 00:13:33,790
And although almost everyone 
told her she was fake,

251
00:13:33,915 --> 00:13:36,735
he still thinks 
i have a real idol.

252
00:13:37,335 --> 00:13:40,782
I do have a real idol. 
And the Heir Advantage.

253
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,710
And also a false idol.

254
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:45,349
Even if my shell-string 
is a bit of a joke,

255
00:13:45,474 --> 00:13:46,910
Chris believes in it.

256
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,399
Are you sure he has it?

257
00:13:48,524 --> 00:13:51,110
Why so many people, 
so easily...

258
00:13:51,235 --> 00:13:53,092
No no. Even if he has the idol,

259
00:13:53,217 --> 00:13:56,210
you can only get rid of it 
by taking it out by surprise.

260
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,052
You have no idea.

261
00:13:58,177 --> 00:14:00,810
I tried twice, 
but we always won.

262
00:14:00,935 --> 00:14:03,975
The only time we could have 
was on Ghost Island.

263
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,610
Dom and Chris have been rivals 
since day one.

264
00:14:06,735 --> 00:14:09,510
This beach is not big enough 
for both.

265
00:14:09,635 --> 00:14:11,189
As soon as one walks away,

266
00:14:11,314 --> 00:14:13,828
the other speaks of him 
to whoever is present.

267
00:14:14,035 --> 00:14:15,481
Dom is a loser.

268
00:14:15,713 --> 00:14:17,510
He's an idiot.

269
00:14:17,635 --> 00:14:19,810
It's a joke, this guy.

270
00:14:19,935 --> 00:14:23,710
Because some of the stuff he puts out 
is totally ridiculous.

271
00:14:23,835 --> 00:14:28,010
I would love to compare myself 
to a Dwyane Wade.

272
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:30,435
I started from nothing, 
and here I am!

273
00:14:30,914 --> 00:14:33,310
Chris needs to show 
his greatness to the world.

274
00:14:33,435 --> 00:14:35,023
Life is full of opportunities.

275
00:14:35,148 --> 00:14:38,042
Like D-Wade at his top, 
I dive into it with both knees.

276
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:40,711
I tire. It becomes painful.

277
00:14:41,205 --> 00:14:42,847
OK ? 
Yeah.

278
00:14:42,972 --> 00:14:44,810
We agree. 
Cool.

279
00:14:44,935 --> 00:14:46,335
Good discussion.

280
00:14:52,035 --> 00:14:53,505
What do you think ?

281
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,810
Where are you, between Dom and Chris?

282
00:14:55,935 --> 00:14:59,410
The only thing with Chris 
is that he's a big target.

283
00:14:59,535 --> 00:15:01,416
Yeah. 
But after...

284
00:15:01,744 --> 00:15:04,010
I don't think Chris will lie.

285
00:15:04,135 --> 00:15:06,203
But Dom... 
Chris, it's...

286
00:15:06,328 --> 00:15:08,527
And you ask him for a trick,

287
00:15:08,652 --> 00:15:11,235
what he will say, he will doubtless do.

288
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,988
Yeah. 
That's the only thing. He is loyal.

289
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:16,710
OK. 
And then Dom...

290
00:15:16,835 --> 00:15:19,710
He is super dangerous. 
Super dangerous.

291
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,407
Everything will be alright.

292
00:15:21,635 --> 00:15:24,110
We will need a majority. 
Yeah.

293
00:15:24,235 --> 00:15:26,435
I believe we are well placed. 
Yes.

294
00:15:26,617 --> 00:15:29,910
Ideal day. 
Dom and Chris go to war.

295
00:15:30,035 --> 00:15:32,724
It distracts me. 
Even from Michael and Libby.

296
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,128
It's incredible.

297
00:15:34,253 --> 00:15:36,522
I've been so 
low on the ladder.

298
00:15:36,647 --> 00:15:39,210
Now that I have more power,

299
00:15:39,335 --> 00:15:40,944
it's nice to know

300
00:15:41,268 --> 00:15:43,985
that we have a 
lot of control now.

301
00:15:58,213 --> 00:15:59,677
Over here, everyone!

302
00:16:12,813 --> 00:16:17,025
Ready for your first 
individual immunity test?

303
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,697
First of all, 
I'm taking up tribal immunity.

304
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,490
Merci Kelly, merci Domenick.

305
00:16:26,013 --> 00:16:28,513
Tribal immunity is over!

306
00:16:30,307 --> 00:16:32,276
This is what you want 
now.

307
00:16:32,413 --> 00:16:33,254
Attractive.

308
00:16:34,314 --> 00:16:35,788
Individual immunity.

309
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:38,983
With that around your neck, 
you're protected on the board.

310
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:40,688
Without, you are not.

311
00:16:40,813 --> 00:16:43,088
Are we attacking this first test? 
Yes !

312
00:16:43,213 --> 00:16:46,188
Today you will stand 
on a narrow beam,

313
00:16:46,313 --> 00:16:48,158
now a statue in balance

314
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:50,499
on a long pole, 
over your head.

315
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,113
Regularly, 
you will advance on the beam,

316
00:16:53,238 --> 00:16:54,588
running the thing.

317
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,557
If you fall

318
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,288
or lose your statue, it's lost.

319
00:16:59,413 --> 00:17:03,105
The last person standing wins 
immunity, is safe from the vote.

320
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,705
The losers: on the council, 
someone will be the eighth person

321
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,588
eliminated from this game.

322
00:17:08,713 --> 00:17:11,084
We draw the places at random 
and we get started.

323
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,335
Everyone is in place.

324
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,768
Raise the poles 
above your heads.

325
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:30,134
And this test... is launched.

326
00:17:34,813 --> 00:17:37,833
Your first 
individual immunity test

327
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,988
and already the air is hot.

328
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,709
You have 
to balance on the beam

329
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:45,888
while holding 
a pole carrying a statue,

330
00:17:46,013 --> 00:17:49,413
with a million dollars at stake.

331
00:17:53,013 --> 00:17:54,788
Things are already moving at Jenna.

332
00:17:54,913 --> 00:17:55,948
It's finish.

333
00:17:56,073 --> 00:17:58,696
Put down the pole, go to the bench.

334
00:18:02,313 --> 00:18:05,488
Donathan suddenly loses his statue. 
It's lost.

335
00:18:05,613 --> 00:18:08,113
It can happen in the blink of an eye.

336
00:18:09,513 --> 00:18:11,413
And the wind picks up.

337
00:18:12,513 --> 00:18:14,213
It's lost on Desiree.

338
00:18:15,113 --> 00:18:18,413
Mother Nature is always an obstacle 
in Survivor.

339
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:26,913
Angela loses her statue, 
it's lost for her.

340
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:28,719
You are only nine.

341
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:31,102
It doesn't take much.

342
00:18:31,372 --> 00:18:34,113
The room for maneuver is zero.

343
00:18:36,303 --> 00:18:39,388
You will stay five minutes 
on the first section.

344
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:42,354
Then you will step on the beam

345
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:44,237
and it will be harder.

346
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,826
Elapsed Time: 5 Minutes

347
00:19:01,684 --> 00:19:02,826
It's time

348
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:04,888
to move on to the next section.

349
00:19:05,112 --> 00:19:07,788
You have to do it or it's lost.

350
00:19:08,282 --> 00:19:10,613
You have 15 seconds.

351
00:19:10,913 --> 00:19:12,522
You have to ask yourself:

352
00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:15,088
"How to maintain the balance

353
00:19:15,213 --> 00:19:17,463
advancing on the beam,

354
00:19:17,588 --> 00:19:19,781
knowing that it is getting 
narrower?"

355
00:19:21,613 --> 00:19:25,688
Everyone arrived 
on the second section, congratulations.

356
00:19:26,127 --> 00:19:27,679
The ordeal continues.

357
00:19:42,313 --> 00:19:44,513
Subitemant, Sebastian lost his statue.

358
00:19:45,513 --> 00:19:47,313
You are only eight.

359
00:19:51,713 --> 00:19:54,288
There is never certainty 
on the board.

360
00:19:54,413 --> 00:19:55,741
especially

361
00:19:56,106 --> 00:19:57,381
to the merger.

362
00:19:57,506 --> 00:19:59,632
The only certainty

363
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,123
that's when you have immunity 
on the board.

364
00:20:07,413 --> 00:20:09,326
Good. It's time 
Elapsed Time: 20 Minutes<br>

365
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,613
to skip to the last section.

366
00:20:12,313 --> 00:20:15,441
Your foot 
should touch the red paint

367
00:20:15,566 --> 00:20:19,212
at the very end of the beam, 
where it is very narrow.

368
00:20:19,477 --> 00:20:21,474
I leave you time.

369
00:20:22,824 --> 00:20:24,508
Chelsea, there you are.

370
00:20:25,913 --> 00:20:28,113
Kellyn, inches away.

371
00:20:33,013 --> 00:20:34,824
Domenick fails.

372
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:39,294
No immunity for Domenick. 
The others continue to advance.

373
00:20:39,662 --> 00:20:41,913
You have 30 seconds.

374
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:45,965
C'est bon, Kelly.

375
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:53,142
Michael fails, it's lost.

376
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:56,251
Chris fails.

377
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:58,555
It's lost, no immunity for him.

378
00:21:06,313 --> 00:21:08,213
Wendell, you have to be at the end.

379
00:21:15,213 --> 00:21:18,001
Wendell fails, he is eliminated!

380
00:21:18,813 --> 00:21:22,388
Many eliminated at once. 
You are only three.

381
00:21:22,513 --> 00:21:26,112
Kellyn, Chelsea and Libby 
are vying for immunity.

382
00:21:26,237 --> 00:21:30,169
After 22 days, the first 
individual immunity challenge.

383
00:21:30,294 --> 00:21:33,713
Three women show others 
how it's done!

384
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:38,749
The wind shakes your statues a little...

385
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:43,048
... forcing you 
to work even harder

386
00:21:43,203 --> 00:21:44,913
to balance them.

387
00:21:47,902 --> 00:21:50,013
Things are moving a bit at Chelsea.

388
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,259
Well recovered.

389
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,113
She does not move.

390
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:04,813
Come on, Chelsea!

391
00:22:04,938 --> 00:22:07,792
It's lost for Chelsea. 
You are only two.

392
00:22:08,113 --> 00:22:09,546
The face-to-face.

393
00:22:12,213 --> 00:22:13,513
For immunity.

394
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:15,852
It is now !

395
00:22:22,598 --> 00:22:23,982
It moves a little

396
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,815
for the statues of the two women.

397
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,041
Libby trembles. 
Kelly's aussi.

398
00:22:33,013 --> 00:22:34,566
Here comes the wind again,

399
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:36,531
who moves the statues

400
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:38,084
and remind you

401
00:22:38,366 --> 00:22:40,210
to stay focused.

402
00:22:44,007 --> 00:22:45,813
The flags are flying.

403
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:49,912
More wind, more instability.

404
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:03,012
And suddenly, Libby loses her statue!

405
00:23:03,137 --> 00:23:06,781
Kellyn wins the first 
individual immunity!

406
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:10,092
Away from the council! 
And his legs give out!

407
00:23:10,217 --> 00:23:13,513
Yeah, but you made it! 
You won the first!

408
00:23:17,113 --> 00:23:18,882
Kelly's !

409
00:23:19,713 --> 00:23:22,813
In brutal mode! 
Brute mode!

410
00:23:23,913 --> 00:23:25,322
Kelly's, venez ici !

411
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:26,745
My God !

412
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:27,961
Well done, Kel!

413
00:23:28,086 --> 00:23:32,134
Kellyn, safe on the board tonight, 
can't be eliminated.

414
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:34,722
As for you, after 22 days,

415
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:37,292
someone will be 
the 8th person eliminated.

416
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:38,888
It won't be you. Cheer.

417
00:23:39,013 --> 00:23:40,788
Go away. See you tonight at the council.

418
00:23:40,913 --> 00:23:42,488
Good job. 
Thanks.

419
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,234
Miss Kellyn 
brings back the trophy.

420
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:46,912
I hardly believe it.

421
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,430
So I'm not leaving tonight

422
00:23:49,555 --> 00:23:52,612
but this vote still makes me 
very nervous,

423
00:23:52,737 --> 00:23:56,212
because Dom and Chris Noble 
tear each other apart.

424
00:23:56,337 --> 00:23:58,718
It is to this council that finally,

425
00:23:58,843 --> 00:24:01,513
the demarcations 
will be really clear.

426
00:24:18,342 --> 00:24:21,309
Bravo, Kellyn! 
Well done.

427
00:24:21,434 --> 00:24:22,646
It was great.

428
00:24:22,771 --> 00:24:24,935
Kelly won, 
I'm happy for her.

429
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:29,142
But not having the necklace, 
I have to come up with a plan.

430
00:24:29,392 --> 00:24:32,553
Are we just gonna... sit embarrassed,

431
00:24:32,678 --> 00:24:34,114
where to start playing?

432
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:35,543
I go to the well.

433
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,186
Des, are you coming?

434
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:39,019
Michael? Ready for action?

435
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,242
I decided to take the lead

436
00:24:41,367 --> 00:24:44,591
and take everyone to the well 
except Domenick and Wendell.

437
00:24:47,274 --> 00:24:49,777
Question: what do you all think?

438
00:24:49,902 --> 00:24:53,263
I spoke with some. 
There is an idol in the game.

439
00:24:53,388 --> 00:24:57,239
We could split the votes, 
if you're interested.

440
00:24:57,364 --> 00:24:59,093
Divide between...

441
00:25:00,764 --> 00:25:02,309
Libby was their target.

442
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:05,315
Doing that would benefit 
the whole tribe.

443
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,615
Can we all agree on this?

444
00:25:08,775 --> 00:25:10,248
What do you think ?

445
00:25:10,373 --> 00:25:13,018
We are open, of course. 
The idol must jump.

446
00:25:13,143 --> 00:25:14,061
Absolutely.

447
00:25:14,186 --> 00:25:16,467
For me, it's personal, okay?

448
00:25:16,592 --> 00:25:18,561
Dom must go.

449
00:25:18,686 --> 00:25:20,397
Problem: I don't have a vote.

450
00:25:20,522 --> 00:25:22,729
So I shield the plan. 
It is very simple.

451
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,310
If Dom plays an idol, Wendell leaves.

452
00:25:25,435 --> 00:25:28,029
If he doesn't play it, he leaves.

453
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:32,673
Isn't that a great plan 
for everyone?

454
00:25:32,923 --> 00:25:34,571
Let's blow up an idol and...

455
00:25:34,724 --> 00:25:36,424
Do you think any of them have it?

456
00:25:38,252 --> 00:25:39,913
Chris' plan is solid.

457
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:43,131
Domenick and Wendell 
are a dangerous duo.

458
00:25:43,256 --> 00:25:46,737
They are smart 
and are threats to me.

459
00:25:46,862 --> 00:25:48,335
But is it real?

460
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,862
What to believe? Dom has one

461
00:25:50,987 --> 00:25:53,878
or is Chris lying 
to make him a target?

462
00:25:54,003 --> 00:25:56,582
The council will show the truth 
of each other's positions,

463
00:25:56,707 --> 00:25:59,724
and if it gets crazy, 
I'm ready to play my idol.

464
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:03,771
Well, tell me, there...

465
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:06,403
I do not see anyone. 
They scattered.

466
00:26:06,528 --> 00:26:09,189
Let Chris go! 
He fucks too much the bronx.

467
00:26:09,314 --> 00:26:12,156
Yes. 
He must go. Let him go!

468
00:26:12,281 --> 00:26:16,248
When they return from the event, 
Chris takes everyone to the pit,

469
00:26:16,373 --> 00:26:18,019
except Dom and me.

470
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:20,035
So... I'm sick of it.

471
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,418
Enough, man!

472
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:25,760
Chris' ego is grotesque and out 
of control. Let him go!

473
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,229
unite against him

474
00:26:28,479 --> 00:26:30,548
and we'll see who doesn't follow us.

475
00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:33,801
If we can get a majority.

476
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:35,083
Dude.

477
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,025
Okay, listen to me.

478
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,502
I have an idol.

479
00:26:38,627 --> 00:26:40,253
A real ? 
Yes.

480
00:26:40,378 --> 00:26:42,592
If you want to see her, 
let's go for a walk.

481
00:26:42,717 --> 00:26:43,633
Useless.

482
00:26:43,758 --> 00:26:45,621
I'm ready to play it today.

483
00:26:45,746 --> 00:26:46,803
Let's do it!

484
00:26:47,724 --> 00:26:49,713
Seen how Chris talks to people,

485
00:26:49,838 --> 00:26:52,734
I can't believe 
he can have enough people

486
00:26:52,859 --> 00:26:54,917
to take out Domenick or me.

487
00:26:55,042 --> 00:26:58,463
So maybe I won't have 
to play my idol.

488
00:26:58,765 --> 00:27:01,301
But if I feel threatened, 
I'll take her out

489
00:27:01,426 --> 00:27:03,245
and gain a few more days.

490
00:27:05,034 --> 00:27:07,970
They're splitting the votes 
between Wendell and you.

491
00:27:08,095 --> 00:27:11,198
If we regroup, 
we can surprise Chris.

492
00:27:11,677 --> 00:27:13,808
Absolutely. 100 %.

493
00:27:14,058 --> 00:27:15,642
Vote Chris. 
OK.

494
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,310
There, we are only four,

495
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:20,936
but Libby and Jenna want to 
vote with us, get Chris out.

496
00:27:21,061 --> 00:27:22,620
No, don't tell them.

497
00:27:22,912 --> 00:27:24,760
Don't tell Jenna and Libby.

498
00:27:24,885 --> 00:27:27,889
They want him gone. 
They bluff you.

499
00:27:29,017 --> 00:27:31,462
I don't know who to trust here.

500
00:27:32,292 --> 00:27:35,216
Apparently you could 
split the votes on me.

501
00:27:36,278 --> 00:27:37,447
It is an option.

502
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,810
But it shouldn't 
be a dictatorship,

503
00:27:39,935 --> 00:27:41,424
rather a democracy.

504
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:44,936
I swear, I'm voting Chris tonight. 
We can take it out.

505
00:27:45,061 --> 00:27:48,456
Then we can live 
as civilized beings.

506
00:27:48,781 --> 00:27:50,816
Tonight is war.

507
00:27:50,941 --> 00:27:54,841
And people 
have to choose sides.

508
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:56,818
Chris's or Dom's.

509
00:27:57,068 --> 00:27:58,127
The friends.

510
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,940
Things are clear.

511
00:28:00,065 --> 00:28:01,860
Choosing a side is hard,

512
00:28:01,985 --> 00:28:05,293
but being safe 
is very nice. Frankly.

513
00:28:10,706 --> 00:28:12,999
How do you see all this?

514
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:15,477
Do the boys face each other or...?

515
00:28:15,602 --> 00:28:17,436
Yeah, that's... 
Looks like.

516
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:20,784
If the four of us Naviti girls 
vote together,

517
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:23,146
we can take out one more Malolo.

518
00:28:23,627 --> 00:28:26,281
Who would you target? 
Me, Libby.

519
00:28:26,406 --> 00:28:29,083
Because Michael is a blatant threat.

520
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:32,799
Eliminating Michael 
is not very hard to plead.

521
00:28:32,924 --> 00:28:35,630
For Libby, yes. 
And she can bond

522
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:37,352
and go unnoticed.

523
00:28:37,477 --> 00:28:41,425
There's a war going on, 
and it's great for me,

524
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,298
because they lose sight of 
what is really going on.

525
00:28:44,548 --> 00:28:47,855
While everyone 
votes for Dom, Wendell or Chris,

526
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:51,480
Naviti girls can date 
who I want to date.

527
00:28:52,872 --> 00:28:56,112
We have to play it carefully. 
Yeah.

528
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:03,869
This is going to be the hardest part of the game.

529
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:04,816
Yeah.

530
00:29:04,941 --> 00:29:07,599
If they target me, I play my idol. 
Yeah.

531
00:29:07,724 --> 00:29:11,025
I'm not afraid to do it. 
I know I know.

532
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:15,963
It's the evening I've been waiting for. 
This rivalry with Chris is going to end.

533
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:19,767
Again and again he refuses 
to bury the hatchet.

534
00:29:20,017 --> 00:29:23,974
This is our chance to release it, 
which I've been waiting for since day 1.

535
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:26,226
There are definitely advantages.

536
00:29:26,351 --> 00:29:28,915
Ghost Island offers a bunch of...

537
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,141
Not just benefits, 
but arguably idols.

538
00:29:32,266 --> 00:29:34,148
How many can there be?

539
00:29:34,312 --> 00:29:36,027
I don't think Chris has anything.

540
00:29:36,152 --> 00:29:39,239
I don't know how many relics there are 
ready to be played,

541
00:29:39,364 --> 00:29:41,531
but I have the Heir Advantage.

542
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:43,964
I can play it at 13 or at 6,

543
00:29:44,089 --> 00:29:46,335
and we are 13 in play.

544
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,068
Fear sharpens the senses.

545
00:29:48,193 --> 00:29:50,865
Keep the fear in your stomach, 
all the time.

546
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:53,250
Whether it's me or Chris 
leaving tonight,

547
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:56,566
this is the time 
when i'll play it all out

548
00:29:56,691 --> 00:29:58,877
and say, "I'm going to shoot this guy."

549
00:30:03,346 --> 00:30:06,504
I'm a little worried 
that not everyone will follow.

550
00:30:06,629 --> 00:30:09,200
If in doubt, 
maybe I should play the idol.

551
00:30:09,325 --> 00:30:12,367
But at the same time, I could 
stay much longer

552
00:30:12,492 --> 00:30:15,289
if I can pass this advice 
and use it on the next one.

553
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:19,329
Tonight is a war. 
It's time to get Dom out.

554
00:30:19,454 --> 00:30:21,963
The animal is injured, 
it's time to finish it off.

555
00:30:47,338 --> 00:30:49,647
Chris, take the single unlit torch 
.

556
00:30:49,966 --> 00:30:51,907
Light it in the fire.

557
00:30:55,204 --> 00:30:57,430
It is part of the council ritual ,

558
00:30:57,571 --> 00:30:59,866
because in this game, 
fire represents your life.

559
00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:02,999
If he disappears, so do you.

560
00:31:05,288 --> 00:31:07,385
Chris. First time on the board.

561
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:10,192
Is this where the game 
really begins for you?

562
00:31:10,317 --> 00:31:12,124
Absolutely. Being here at the council,

563
00:31:12,249 --> 00:31:14,061
I feel more alive than ever.

564
00:31:14,186 --> 00:31:17,224
I know that at some point, 
it can represent death,

565
00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:20,920
but experimenting 
takes the game to another level.

566
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,017
Donathan. What has changed 
in recent days?

567
00:31:24,142 --> 00:31:26,181
now that you are 13?

568
00:31:26,306 --> 00:31:30,215
I was finally able to meet 
those I didn't know.

569
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,175
There are the old bonds of the beginnings,

570
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,628
then those of the mixtures. 
There are so many relationships

571
00:31:36,753 --> 00:31:38,087
it's stunning.

572
00:31:38,212 --> 00:31:42,473
Sebastian. It's interesting, 
this game can be so complicated,

573
00:31:42,598 --> 00:31:45,779
and yet, often, 
be played on an impression.

574
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:49,616
In your normal life, 
do you rely on your impressions?

575
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,661
Completely.

576
00:31:51,786 --> 00:31:54,363
It feels like riding 
on a fishing boat,

577
00:31:54,488 --> 00:31:57,690
we say to ourselves: "He looks like a jerk, 
he looks cool."

578
00:31:57,847 --> 00:31:59,859
And it can be the exact opposite

579
00:32:00,023 --> 00:32:02,678
when we go for a beer with them,

580
00:32:02,803 --> 00:32:04,508
Domenick. It's essential.

581
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:08,507
Because in this game, you have to be able to 
adapt and reassess,

582
00:32:08,632 --> 00:32:11,197
and say, 
"Maybe I should talk to him again."

583
00:32:11,322 --> 00:32:14,417
It actually applies perfectly, 
Jeffrey,

584
00:32:14,542 --> 00:32:17,710
to the situation 
I have been living for 22 days

585
00:32:17,861 --> 00:32:19,412
with my good friend Chris.

586
00:32:20,034 --> 00:32:23,437
Can I give my version? 
Go ahead, I don't care.

587
00:32:23,562 --> 00:32:26,121
On day 1, 
I made a crucial mistake.

588
00:32:26,246 --> 00:32:28,288
Right now we have a test.

589
00:32:28,538 --> 00:32:31,969
You ask, "Would anyone 
have made a different choice?"

590
00:32:32,094 --> 00:32:34,648
I was the only jerk 
to raise my hand.

591
00:32:34,773 --> 00:32:37,584
I waited a day 
and explained to Chris:

592
00:32:37,709 --> 00:32:40,567
"Look, I said that without thinking."

593
00:32:40,727 --> 00:32:43,395
And his response was, 
"Do you have an idol?"

594
00:32:43,652 --> 00:32:46,406
I went, 
"Wow! What do you mean by that?"

595
00:32:46,578 --> 00:32:48,833
Him: 
"You seem to be after me."

596
00:32:48,958 --> 00:32:52,612
It was almost an interrogation, 
more than a conversation.

597
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:56,277
So, after this "conversation", 
I went to find an idol.

598
00:32:56,402 --> 00:32:57,951
What a coincidence !

599
00:32:58,201 --> 00:33:01,505
That he looked for her and found 
her right after that, I don't believe.

600
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,590
And shit! So there you go, Jeff...

601
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,716
I don't even hide it anymore.

602
00:33:06,113 --> 00:33:07,694
The. Here it is, friend.

603
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:10,561
I'm going to put it on, because... 
It's the shell.

604
00:33:10,686 --> 00:33:12,468
So I show it to him,

605
00:33:12,593 --> 00:33:16,163
but no way to convince him. 
What should I do with him, Jeffrey?

606
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:19,526
I will say one thing: 
tonight is an important night.

607
00:33:19,651 --> 00:33:22,919
It's a showdown! 
Yes, for me anyway.

608
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:25,772
So I put 
on my finest attire.

609
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,844
Wow.

610
00:33:28,327 --> 00:33:30,633
Domenick. You captivated 
everyone.

611
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,795
Now the replica. Chris.

612
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,288
Yes, Dom showed me the idol.

613
00:33:35,455 --> 00:33:37,601
But then, 
returning from Ghost Island,

614
00:33:37,726 --> 00:33:41,195
I find out that they tried 
to eliminate Angela

615
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,691
because they wanted to get rid 
of my closest ally.

616
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:46,933
When we were all Naviti.

617
00:33:47,085 --> 00:33:49,113
Hold on. Immediately after mixing,

618
00:33:49,238 --> 00:33:52,226
you went directly 
to the Malolo side.

619
00:33:52,351 --> 00:33:54,006
It's not "staying together",

620
00:33:54,131 --> 00:33:56,197
what we wanted. 
I was suspicious of him.

621
00:33:56,322 --> 00:33:59,352
Why, when he told you everything?

622
00:33:59,477 --> 00:34:01,147
I understand your frustration.

623
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:04,050
But it's mostly between Dom, me 
and my instinct,

624
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,654
who tells me to beware of him. 
OK.

625
00:34:08,394 --> 00:34:10,723
It's crazy, 
that everything is on the carpet.

626
00:34:10,973 --> 00:34:11,874
Sorry.

627
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:14,558
But now that we're 
finally here together,

628
00:34:14,683 --> 00:34:16,971
let it be a showdown, fine with 
me.

629
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:20,298
Domenick. Does that mean 
one of you two is leaving tonight?

630
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:23,645
I know I'm in the hot seat, 
no doubt about it.

631
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,888
It started when we got back to camp. 
Eleven of them left.

632
00:34:27,013 --> 00:34:28,656
Wendell and I were alone.

633
00:34:28,781 --> 00:34:31,390
It was Dom and I in the living room.

634
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:34,577
What happened ? 
Where were they all?

635
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,527
Apparently 
they were all very thirsty.

636
00:34:37,652 --> 00:34:41,071
Eleven, in single file, 
left to fetch water.

637
00:34:41,196 --> 00:34:43,855
Angela. Is it fair to say,

638
00:34:46,132 --> 00:34:48,503
that we have been kept out 
of discussions

639
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,620
that could impact this advice?

640
00:34:50,745 --> 00:34:52,842
Very clearly, Jeff.

641
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:56,223
And it's easy to say, 
"Let's go with this big plan!"

642
00:34:56,348 --> 00:34:59,747
But I don't know how many 
smaller plans there are.

643
00:34:59,872 --> 00:35:03,571
So, if I see a majority 
emerging, I follow it.

644
00:35:03,696 --> 00:35:08,109
Libby. Who led the group? 
Someone must have said, "I'm thirsty!"

645
00:35:09,465 --> 00:35:11,563
Yeah, that guy! 
Chris, so.

646
00:35:11,688 --> 00:35:13,786
Chris, are you still the leader?

647
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:17,651
You were chosen on the first day, 
and apparently you are still being followed.

648
00:35:17,881 --> 00:35:22,068
I am at least someone 
with whom we get along well.

649
00:35:22,193 --> 00:35:25,722
Maybe they easily discuss 
certain situations with me.

650
00:35:25,847 --> 00:35:27,626
Domenick. It's a fear

651
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:31,037
that Chris and the whole band 
do something without you.

652
00:35:31,287 --> 00:35:33,740
Absolutely. 
Fortunately, I have this object,

653
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,350
but my friend doesn't. 
They could play it tricky.

654
00:35:36,475 --> 00:35:41,010
I might have to decide: 
protect him or protect myself?

655
00:35:41,553 --> 00:35:43,939
I don't know more than you.

656
00:35:44,064 --> 00:35:46,132
But I'm really scared tonight.

657
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:49,801
Libby. What is this revelation 
about Dom and Chris

658
00:35:49,926 --> 00:35:52,308
said about the stakes of this game?

659
00:35:52,433 --> 00:35:54,293
So far we are 13.

660
00:35:54,448 --> 00:35:57,168
We form bonds, 
we experience alliances.

661
00:35:57,293 --> 00:36:00,112
We all listened to Chris, listened to Dom.

662
00:36:00,237 --> 00:36:03,219
We don't know who we can trust, 
who we can no longer trust.

663
00:36:03,344 --> 00:36:06,538
That's crazy. 
The stakes are so high!

664
00:36:06,663 --> 00:36:10,779
Kellyn. Only you, at this moment, 
are completely safe.

665
00:36:10,904 --> 00:36:12,686
What does it do ?

666
00:36:12,811 --> 00:36:16,183
Everyone knows that in Survivor 
the first vote after the merger

667
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:17,996
is crazy about crazy.

668
00:36:18,121 --> 00:36:20,733
There may be idols, 
benefits.

669
00:36:20,858 --> 00:36:23,836
And with such an open council,

670
00:36:23,961 --> 00:36:26,706
I'm glad to know 
that it won't be my name

671
00:36:26,831 --> 00:36:28,621
who will come out of the ballot box.

672
00:36:29,011 --> 00:36:31,652
Chris. As the vote draws near,

673
00:36:31,777 --> 00:36:34,685
there is talk of a group of 11, 
but in fact, you do not know.

674
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:37,779
What can you do to make sure 
it won't be you?

675
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:41,556
I try to develop 
as much confidence as possible.

676
00:36:41,681 --> 00:36:45,173
The frustrations, between Dom and me, 
are frustrations.

677
00:36:45,298 --> 00:36:46,448
It's like that.

678
00:36:46,573 --> 00:36:50,216
At the end of the day, there are 
key alliances, real links,

679
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:53,352
but above all, 
you have to trust your instincts.

680
00:36:53,602 --> 00:36:56,089
And I will do it again.

681
00:36:56,938 --> 00:36:59,465
Well, let's see how it turns out.

682
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:02,716
It's time to vote. 
Chris, over to you.

683
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,137
Tear it all down, man!

684
00:37:05,798 --> 00:37:07,166
Thank you, friend.

685
00:37:12,385 --> 00:37:14,163
Nothing against you.

686
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,654
I love you. Love !

687
00:37:30,565 --> 00:37:33,626
It was a pleasure serving you 
coffee for 22 days.

688
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,080
See you on the other side, 
my brother.

689
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:52,385
We... have won a lot together.

690
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,070
For that, respect.

691
00:37:54,409 --> 00:37:56,983
But socially, 
you don't know what you're doing.

692
00:37:57,129 --> 00:37:59,384
I hope you stop 
saying "I" so much

693
00:37:59,509 --> 00:38:01,492
and start listening to people.

694
00:38:01,617 --> 00:38:03,189
Oh yeah, and finally,

695
00:38:03,371 --> 00:38:05,769
someone had to say it, 
it will be me:

696
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:07,693
stop rapping!

697
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:09,211
You are a shit.

698
00:38:09,924 --> 00:38:11,117
A rap.

699
00:38:11,242 --> 00:38:14,404
You're useless. You can't rap. 
Your rhymes are creepy.

700
00:38:16,624 --> 00:38:18,343
Put the mic down, man.

701
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:20,495
Put down the pencil, man.

702
00:38:20,729 --> 00:38:22,484
Use an eraser.

703
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,724
I will count the votes.

704
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,823
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

705
00:38:53,948 --> 00:38:55,866
now is the time to do it.

706
00:39:09,355 --> 00:39:10,466
OK.

707
00:39:15,721 --> 00:39:17,463
Jeff, Jeff, Jeff!

708
00:39:19,194 --> 00:39:20,949
I have a better idea.

709
00:39:25,168 --> 00:39:26,092
So...

710
00:39:26,217 --> 00:39:30,343
This is the Heir Advantage 
of Sierra Dawn Thomas.

711
00:39:31,005 --> 00:39:33,406
In fact, Jacob won it,

712
00:39:33,531 --> 00:39:34,888
first day.

713
00:39:35,013 --> 00:39:36,616
He bequeathed it to Morgan,

714
00:39:36,866 --> 00:39:38,150
who gave it to me.

715
00:39:38,963 --> 00:39:42,521
He gives me immunity 
when there are 13 people left in play

716
00:39:42,771 --> 00:39:43,677
or six.

717
00:39:43,971 --> 00:39:46,248
I'm playing it tonight for me, at 13.

718
00:39:47,121 --> 00:39:48,498
Thanks. 
You're welcome.

719
00:39:55,249 --> 00:39:57,269
This is the Heir Advantage.

720
00:39:57,419 --> 00:39:59,922
Votes against Dom 
will not count.

721
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:06,514
I will read the votes.

722
00:40:16,326 --> 00:40:18,325
Chris. 
Two votes Chris.

723
00:40:25,845 --> 00:40:26,617
Libby.

724
00:40:26,742 --> 00:40:29,135
Two votes Libby, two votes Chris.

725
00:40:33,858 --> 00:40:34,735
Chris.

726
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:37,238
Three votes Chris, two votes Libby.

727
00:40:41,683 --> 00:40:42,536
Chris.

728
00:40:42,661 --> 00:40:44,150
Four votes Chris.

729
00:40:46,536 --> 00:40:47,336
Chris.

730
00:40:47,461 --> 00:40:48,790
Five votes Chris.

731
00:40:53,901 --> 00:40:56,286
Six votes Chris, two votes Libby.

732
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,834
Eighth person eliminated 
and first member of the jury:

733
00:41:01,986 --> 00:41:03,306
Chris. 
Good game.

734
00:41:03,452 --> 00:41:06,109
Seven is enough. 
Bring me your torch.

735
00:41:09,537 --> 00:41:11,942
Good luck, brother. 
No worries, man.

736
00:41:13,562 --> 00:41:15,715
Good game. 
You know I love you.

737
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,850
Oh, the torch!

738
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,458
Chris, the tribe has spoken.

739
00:41:25,534 --> 00:41:26,832
Thank you, Probst.

740
00:41:26,957 --> 00:41:28,025
I appreciate.

741
00:41:28,785 --> 00:41:30,196
It's time to go.

742
00:41:41,323 --> 00:41:43,752
If this advice is an indicator

743
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:46,390
the course 
of the second half of the game,

744
00:41:46,515 --> 00:41:50,616
everyone has an interest in playing 
every moment, every day.

745
00:41:50,866 --> 00:41:53,565
Take your torches, 
return to the camp. Good night.

746
00:42:05,797 --> 00:42:08,464
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

747
00:42:12,002 --> 00:42:14,255
Next time in Survivor...

748
00:42:14,425 --> 00:42:16,019
When you're left out...

749
00:42:16,144 --> 00:42:17,890
I have an idol. 
What ?!

750
00:42:18,015 --> 00:42:20,094
Domenick and Wendell 
have too much power.

751
00:42:20,254 --> 00:42:21,793
...that we don't know who to trust...

752
00:42:23,019 --> 00:42:24,999
I want to see the ultimate battle.

753
00:42:25,163 --> 00:42:27,294
... you have to keep the objective in sight.

754
00:42:27,877 --> 00:42:30,192
Now 
let's move on to the delicacies.

755
00:42:30,317 --> 00:42:31,906
Go ahead ! 
Wow !

756
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:35,518
I just got eliminated 
with an idol in my pocket.

757
00:42:35,643 --> 00:42:37,849
At least 
I didn't leave her on the island.

758
00:42:37,974 --> 00:42:39,798
Clearly, Dom organized this,

759
00:42:39,923 --> 00:42:42,570
and some of my comrades 
wanted me out.

760
00:42:42,695 --> 00:42:46,237
JT and Chris Noble, 
aka The Noble One: zero out of two.

761
00:42:46,362 --> 00:42:48,670
This idol 
is definitely cursed.

762
00:42:48,795 --> 00:42:52,031
This little haunted thing 
will give me nightmares for a long time.
