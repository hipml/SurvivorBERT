THREE TRIBES BASED ON THE

42
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:29,339
PERSONALITY TRAITS THEY USED

43
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,634
MOST IN THEIR DAILY LIVES.

I DON'T KNOW.

>> Jeff: AND BEAUTY.

55
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:46,189
>> I THINK WE'RE BEAUTY.

56
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,107
>> Jeff: THE ONLY QUESTION WAS

57
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,943
WHICH QUALITY WOULD PROVE THE

58
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:53,154
MOST VALUABLE.

59
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,406
THE BRAWN TRIBE QUICKLY LIVED UP

60
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,325
TO THEIR NAME.

61
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,536
PUTTING THEIR MUSCLES TO GOOD

63
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,872
>> I COULD TELL THAT WE'RE

64
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:03,665
DEFINITELY GOING TO DOMINATE.

69
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,880

>> I'M LOVIN' 'OUR TRIBE.

73
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,513
YOU GUYS ARE THE BOMB.

74
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:19,973
>> Jeff: BUT THE BRAIN TRIBE

75
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:20,974
WAS A DIFFERENT STORY.

76
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,393
>> NO, NO, NO, FLAT SIDE.

77
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,061
>> Jeff: THEY OVERTHOUGHT

78
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:25,395
EVERYTHING.

79
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,187
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FOUR

80
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,188
STAKES, THREE FEET HIGH.

81
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,356
>> Jeff: AND IT WAS A

82
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:28,606
DISASTER.

83
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,358
>> NOT VERY SMART FOR THE BRAIN

84
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:30,567
TRIBE.

85
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,192
>> Jeff: THEY WERE ONE OF THE

86
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,404
WORST TRIBES IN "SURVIVOR"

87
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:34,612
HISTORY.

88
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:38,533
THEY COULDN'T GET ALONG--

89
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,118
>> SOUND LIKE THE MENTAL

90
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:40,368
PATIENT.

91
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,120
YOU LEFT THE MENTAL PATIENT

92
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,621
ALONE AND I WENT CRAZY.

93
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:44,289
>> Jeff: AND THEY COULDN'T WIN

94
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,415
A CHALLENGE.

95
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,207
THERE IT IS, BRAWN WINS, SENDING

96
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,084
THE BRAIN TRIBE TO TRIBAL

97
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:48,543
COUNCIL ONCE AGAIN.

98
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,670
>> HOW DID WE COME UP WITH THE

99
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:51,296
CRITERIA FOR BRAINS?

100
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,007
I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT DATA.

101
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,174
>> Jeff: FORTUNATELY FOR THEM,

102
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,426
THERE WAS A TWIST IN THE GAME.

103
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,304
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY, DROP YOUR

104
00:02:59,387 --> 00:02:59,512
BUFFS.

105
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,723
WE'RE GOING TO FORM TWO NEW

106
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:01,931
TRIBES.

107
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,766
AFTER THE SWITCH, THE THREE

108
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,351
REMAINING BRAIN MEMBERS WERE ALL

109
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:11,232
ON THE NEW APARRI TRIBE WHERE

110
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:15,945
THEY FOUND THEMSELVES ON THE TOP

111
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,780
THE FOOD CHAIN.

112
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:18,406
OVER ON THE NEW SOLANA TRIBE.

113
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,325
>> MAN, LOOK AT THE SHELTER.

114
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,952
>> Jeff: BRAWN HAD A 5-2

115
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,245
ADVANTAGE OVER L.J. AND JEFRA.

116
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,330
BUT MATH WAS NEVER THEIR STRONG

117
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:25,538
SUIT.

118
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,415
>> I WANT TO GET CLIFF OUT.

119
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,834
>> HEY, LET'S POUND ON IT, ALL

120
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:30,043
RIGHT.

121
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:30,710
>> Jeff: AND THEY BEGAN TO

122
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:31,294
TURN ON EACH OTHER.

123
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,754
>> I DON'T LIKE CLIFF.

124
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,131
CLIFF IS A VERY INFLUENTIAL

125
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:35,381
PERSON.

126
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:35,965
>> Jeff: FIFTH PERSON VOTED

127

CLIFF.

129
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,346
CLIFF WAS BLINDSIDED IN A

130
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,388
SHOCKING VOTE.

131
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,515
AND WHEN THEY COULDN'T GET ALONG

132
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,183
--

133
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,392
>> EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU I CANNOT

134
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:46,601
STAND.

135
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:47,644
>> LET ME MAKE THIS REALLY CLEAR

136
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,104
TO YOU-- I DON'T LIKE YOU.

137
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,357
>> Jeff: LINDSEY JUST PLAIN

138

LINDY IS PULLING HERSELF FROM

140
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:54,484

TWO FOR THE PRICE OF ONE.

144
00:03:59,072 --> 00:03:59,781
>> IS THAT A ROW BOAT?

145
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,824
>> I THINK SOMETHING'S BREWING.

146
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,493
>> Jeff: WHEN THE TRIBES

147
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:03,701

>> Jeff: THE DIVISION OF POWER

150

>> YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT

192
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,141
ALLIANCES LOOKING FOR AN IDOL AT

193
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:08,474
THE SAME TIME.

195
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:11,060
ADVANTAGE.

196
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:11,853
TONY DRAWS THE ADVANTAGE.

197
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:12,979

198
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:16,691

00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,443
>> Jeff: AND EVEN A SPY SHACK.

201
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:21,612
>> BING!

202
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:22,488
>> Jeff: THERE WERE ALSO

203
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,282
IMMUNITY RUNS.

SUPERPOWER SHE DOES IT, TASHA

206
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,370
WINS IMMUNITY.

207
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,832
TASHA WINS.

208
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:33,082
BLUNDERS.

209
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:37,670
>> COME ON DOWN, BROTHER.

>> Jeff: IDOL FINDS.

211
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,342
>> I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

212
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,385
I HAVE TWO IDOLS.

213
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,386
EVEN THE SPECIAL IDOL.

214
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,431
>> Jeff: AND GOOD

215
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,183
OLD-FASHIONED BLINDSIDES.

216
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,185
L.J.

217
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,604
JEFRA.

218
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,398
WHEN ALL THE DUST SETTLED, TWO

219
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,317
BRAIN AND THREE BRAWN REMAINED,

220
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,194
AND THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS

221
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,529
NO DIFFERENT THAN THE REST.

222
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,074
WOW, BIG REACTION.

223
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,408
TONY BLUFFED ABOUT HIS POWERLESS

224
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,910
IDOL THAT HE'S HOPING WILL BE

225
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,328
HIS TICKET TO THE END.

226
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,287
>> FIVE PEOPLE LEFT.

227
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,539
I HAVE TO USE IT, AND I HAVE

228
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,165
ANOTHER SURPRISE FOR THEM WHEN I

229
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:17,376
USE THIS IDOL, JEFF, BUT I WON'T

230
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,337
DISCLOSE THAT YET AS OF NOW.

231
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,088
>> Jeff: TRISH.

232
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,590
>> IT WAS ANOTHER DEVASTATING

233
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:22,965
BLINDSIDE.

234
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:23,633
>> Jeff: TRISH, THE TRIBE HAS

235
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:23,841
SPOKEN.

236
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,135
>> THANK YOU, GOOD LUCK.

237
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,678
>> Jeff: AND SPENCER WAS LEFT

238
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,805
AT THE BOTTOM ONCE AGAIN.

239
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,348
>> Jeff: WELL, YOU HAVE MADE

240
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,557
IT TO THE FINAL FOUR, AND MY

241
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,558
PREDICTION IS IT IS GOING TO BE

242
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:38,356
A WILD FINISH.

243
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,650
POWER ARE LEFT.

244
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,777
TONY-- THIS NEW JERSEY COP WILL

245
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,737
STOP AT NOTHING TO WIN THE GAME.

246
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,156
HE'S FOUND THREE IMMUNITY IDOLS

247
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,951
AND HAS OH, STRAIGHT MULTIPLE

248
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:50,243
BLINDSIDES.

249
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,661
WILL HIS AGGRESSIVE GAME GET HIM

250
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:55,748
TO THE END OR WILL IT BACKFIRE?

251
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,167
>> I'M PROBABLY THE VILLAIN, BUT

252
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,669
EVERYTHING I DID WAS SURVIVAL

253
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,294
BASED.

254
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,879
I CAME TO WIN A MILLION DOLLARS,

255
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:02,630
AND MY FOCUS IS STILL TO WIN A

256
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,258
MILLION DOLLARS.

257
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,051
>> Jeff: WOO-- THIS MARTIAL

258
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,886
ARTS INSTRUCTOR IS A SOCIAL AND

259
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,762
PHYSICAL THREAT.

260
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,514
BUT TO GET TO THE END, IT WILL

261
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,225
TAKE SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM

262
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:14,475
WITHIN.

263
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,811
>> BEING ABLE TO ADAPT IS VERY

264
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:17,186
CRITICAL.

265
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,355
YOU PUT WATER INTO A BOWL, YOU

266
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:20,356
GOTTA BECOME BOWL.

267
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,024
IF I CONTINUE TO DO THAT, THEN I

268
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,026
HAVE A GREAT SHOT AT COMING OUT

269
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,070
ON TOP.

270
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,113
>> Jeff: KASS.

271
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,614
SHE NICKNAMED HERSELF "CHAOS

272
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,367
KASS" AND IT WASN'T FAR FROM THE

273
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:31,534
TRUTH.

274
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,076
SHE HAS BEEN THE CENTER OF

275
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,702
CONFLICT, AND NEVER AFRAID TO

276
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,705
CHANGE THE GAME.

277
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:36,706
SHE'LL TAKE DOWN ANYONE WHO

278
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,416
STANDS IN HER WAY.

279
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,250
>> THIS IS A GAME.

280
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,334
I'M NOT YOUR FRIEND.

281
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,669
I'M NOT HERE TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

282
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,462
I MEAN, IT'S "SURVIVOR."

283
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:43,921
NO ONE HAS INTEGRITY.

284
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,882
IT'S A MILLION BUCKS.

285
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:46,591
>> Jeff: SPENCER-- HIS GAME

286
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,927
HAS BEEN ONE WILD RIDE.

287
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,804
HE'S GONE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM

288
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,598
MORE THAN ANY OTHER SURVIVOR.

289
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,517
BUT THROUGH IT ALL, HE HAS NEVER

290
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,685
GIVEN UP.

291
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,687
WILL THIS UNDERDOG FINALLY CATCH

292
00:07:59,770 --> 00:07:59,896
A BREAK?

293
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,024
>> I HAVE TO GO INTO THIS OUT

294
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,650
FOR BLOOD, READY TO WIN AT ALL

295
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,193
COSTS BECAUSE THIS IS IT.

296
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,111
THIS IS MY SHOT AT THE MILLION

297
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,697
DOLLARS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

298
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,158
>> Jeff: FIND OUT TONIGHT WHO

299
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,701
WILL WIN THE MILLION DOLLAR

300
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,329
PRIZE AND TITLE OF SOLE

301
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:19,999
SURVIVOR.

302
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:21,959
Captioning brought to you by

303
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,045
Survivor Productions, CBS,

304
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,139
>> NICE TRIBAL, GUYS.

305
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,308
THAT'S ONE FOR THE BOOKS.

306
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:41,562
THAT WAS CRAZY.

307
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,106
WAIT, SO, TONY, YOU VOTED FOR

308
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:44,398
TRISH?

309
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:44,607
>> YEAH.

310
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,733
>> WHY DID YOU VOTE FOR TRISH?

311
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,777
>> BECAUSE I DON'T PLAY THE GAME

312
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,570
ON EMOTIONS, KASS.

313
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,240
I PLAY IT STRATEGICALLY.

314
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,366
>> DID YOU TALK TO WOO ABOUT THE

315
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,659
FACT YOU WERE GOING TO DO THAT?

316
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:55,701
>> AND I DO NOT FEEL GOOD ABOUT

317
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,620
IT AT ALL.

318
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,871
SHE HASN'T HURT NOBODY.

319
00:08:58,955 --> 00:08:59,705
SHE HASN'T BLINDSIDED ANYBODY.

320
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,791
SHE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING FOR

321
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,334
ANYBODY TO DISLIKE, AND YOU

322
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,502
CAN'T TAKE SOMEBODY LIKE THAT TO

323
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,419
THE END.

324
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:05,920
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

325
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:09,048
I'M A LITTLE SAD THAT I HAD TO

326
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,175
OUST ONE OF MY BEST ALLIES, ONE

327
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,636
OF MY MOST LOYAL, MOST HONEST,

328
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,888
MOST SINCERE ALLIES WHICH WAS

329
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:16,264
TRISH.

330
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:16,681
BUT I HAD NO CHOICE.

331
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,267
AND I FEEL HORRIBLE ABOUT IT,

332
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,685
BUT I THINK IT WAS THE MOST

333
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,562
STRATEGIC MOVE FOR ME TO MAKE.

334
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,396
>> CONGRATS, GUYS.

335
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,648
>> CONGRATS, SPENCE, MAN.

336
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,608
>> CONGRATS, KASS.

337
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,485
>> FINAL FOUR, THAT'S AWESOME.

338
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:30,778
>> CONGRATS, EVERYONE.

339
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:31,862
>> IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING, MAN.

340
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:32,822
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M AT THE

341
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:33,114
FINAL FOUR.

342
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,366
I MEAN GETTING THROWN UNDER THE

343
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,576
BUS TIME AFTER TIME AFTER TIME.

344
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,661
I'M AMAZED THAT I'M HERE.

345
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:42,581
BUT TRIBAL WAS DEMORALIZING WHEN

346
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,959
TONY PULLED OUT HIS SECOND IDOL

347
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,627
THAT LOOKED SIMILAR TO THE

348
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,505
NORMAL IDOL THAT WAS HEAVIER AND

349
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:49,964
TIED AROUND A STRING.

350
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,383
>> THE SAME THING, AS YOU KNOW,

351
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,718
THAT IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A

352
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,052
NECKLACE, YOU CAN'T GO TO THE

353
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:55,928
FINALS BECAUSE YOU'RE A THREAT.

354
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:56,178
>> RIGHT.

355
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,430
>> SAME THING AS ME.

356
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:58,889
I KNOW IF I DIDN'T HAVE

357
00:09:58,973 --> 00:09:59,515
PROTECTION, I WASN'T GOING TO

358
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:01,100
THE FINALS.

359
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,476
I'M GUARANTEED FINAL THREE SO

360
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,603
IT'S UP TO ME PRETTY MUCH.

361
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,440
>> SOMEONE COULD WIN IMMUNITY.

362
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,191
>> FENDING ON WHAT THE POWERS

363
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:09,358
ARE.

364
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,818
THAT I'M NOT GOING TO DISCUSS IT

365
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:11,527
ANY FURTHER.

366
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,487
>> IF TONY IS ACTUALLY

367
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,113
GUARANTEED THE FINAL THREE, LIKE

368
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,366
HE CLAIMS, IT'S GOING TO MEAN

369
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,492
PROBLEMS FOR ME.

370
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,494
WE'VE BEEN ARCH RIVALS THE

371
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,329
ENTIRE GAME, AND IF HE MAKES IT

372
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,748
TO THE END, IT CAN BE GOOD FOR

373
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:27,418
MY GAME.

374
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,920
>> POTENTIALLY WHO YOU WINS.

375
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,881
>> THE VOTE WILL BE 3-1 OR 2-2

376
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,966
FOR THE OTHER TWO, AND I DON'T

377
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:34,842
KNOW HOW TONY'S IDOL FIGURES

378
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:35,676
INTO ALL OF THAT.

379
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,220
WE'LL SEE.

380
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,764
>> WE WILL SEE, MAN.

381
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,975
BACK HOME, ON MY MOTHERLAND, I'M

382
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:43,893
A POLICE OFFICER, I CAN'T BE

383
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:44,101
CORRUPT.

384
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,062
OUT HERE ALL I'M DOING IS

385
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,480
BLUFFING AND I'M LYING MY ASS

386
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:47,646
OFF.

387
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,649
>> KASS, HOW SHOCKED WERE WERE

388
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:54,695
YOU WHEN HE PULLED THAT OUT.

389
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,697
>> I WAS SURPRISED HE HAD IT.

390
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,158
>> I HAVE BEEN TELLING THEM

391
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:02,828
ABOUT THE IDOL, AND I'VE BEEN

392
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,080
BLUFFING SAYING I CAN USE IT FOR

393
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:04,789
FINAL FOUR.

394
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:08,542
THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN A SOUV

395
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:08,751
YEAR.

396
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,377
IT'S USELESS IN THIS GAME.

397
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,711
TODAY WAS THE LAST DAY I COULD

398
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:11,921
USE IT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

399
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,297
THE ONLY THING I HAVE GOING FOR

400
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,132
ME RIGHT NOW IS MY BLUFF BUT IF

401
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,550
I DON'T PULL THIS OFF AND I

402
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,636
DON'T WIN AN INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY

403
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,845
NECKLACE, I MIGHT BE IN SERIOUS

404
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,138
TROUBLE SO CLOSE TO THE END

405
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,223
WHERE IT'S GOING TO HURT THE

406
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:25,309
MOST.

407
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,281
♪

408
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:57,800
>> TRISH HAD AN EVIL SIDE.

409
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,428
SHE WAS PRETTY HARSH YESTERDAY.

410
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,929
SHE HAS A HUGE CAPACITY TO HATE.

411
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,472
SHE HATES LINDSEY.

412
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,932
SHE HATES ME.

413
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,226
SHE HATES MORGAN.

414
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:07,852
WHY DOES SOMEONE HATE SOMETHING

415
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:11,605
SO MUCH?

416
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,858
TONY IS AN IDIOT.

417
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,025
PARANOID, AND EMOTIONAL.

418
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,193
AND LAST NIGHT, HE MADE A

419
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:16,610
PARANOID DECISION.

420
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,778
HE DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT.

421
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,321
HE DIDN'T THINK THAT PEOPLE WERE

422
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,823
CAPABLE OF DISLIKING TRISH.

423
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,534
WHEN IN REALITY, I'M PRETTY SURE

424
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,119
ALMOST EVERYONE DISLIKES TRISH.

425
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:25,870
WHY SHOULD I LET HER WALK ALL

426
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,037
OVER ME?

427
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:27,997
>> SHE DIDN'T.

428
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,415
SHE'S OUT.

429
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:29,874
SHE'S OUT.

430
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:30,124
YOU WON.

431
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,293
YOU GET THE LAST LAUGH.

432
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,169
DON'T YOU GET IT?

433
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,086
>> I GET THAT.

434
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,629
I THINK THEY MADE A MISTAKE

435
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,755
YESTERDAY IN VOTING OUT TRISH,

436
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,549
BUT IT WASN'T ME, SO I DON'T

437
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:38,841
CARE.

438
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,926
AND TONY, I MEAN HE'S GOT ALL

439
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,470
THESE IDOLS.

440
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:42,761
>> I'M SAFE.

441
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:43,220
>> I KNOW YOU'RE SAFE.

442
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,805
>> I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT.

443
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,058
THAT'S WHY I CAN GO AND BE COCKY

444
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,351
AND CONFIDENT IN MY GAME.

445
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,019
>> BUT HE HASN'T HAD TO DO MUCH.

446
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,021
HE WAS ON A WINNING TEAM ALL THE

447
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:59,653
WAY UP TO THE MERGE.

448
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:11,832
>> WHAT'S THAT?

449
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,918
MAYBE IT'S FINAL FOUR TREATMENT.

450
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,878
>> I HOPE IT'S LIKE A PICNIC.

451
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,922
A COUPLE OF BASKETS OF BREAD AND

452
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:18,172
CHEESE.

453
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,382
>> I'LL TAKE IT.

454
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,842
>> WHO'S THAT?

455
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:22,885
FOOD?

456
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,261
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

457
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,221
>> THAT'S YOUR HUSBAND.

458
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,555
>> OH, MY GOD!

459
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,848
MY HUSBAND'S HERE.

460
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:34,396
>> WHAT?

461
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,773
WE WERE LAYING AROUND, AND IT

462
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,359
WAS, LIKE, THE "LOVE BOAT"

463
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,319
SHOWED UP, AND THERE WAS MY

464
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:40,569
HUSBAND.

465
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,820
THIS IS A HUGE PART OF ANYONE

466
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,197
OUT HERE'S LIFE.

467
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,867
SO, YEAH, I MIGHT CRY.

468
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:47,826
DAMN IT.

469
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,078
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE-- WHERE

470
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,121
ARE MY DEVIL HORNS.

471
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,998
>> YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN

472
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:53,249
THROUGH.

473
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,543
>> I CAN IMAGINE.

474
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,835
>> I LOVE YOU.

475
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:57,503
>> I LOVE YOU.

476
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,004
>> I'M NOT AN EMOTIONAL GUY, BUT

477
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,382
IT WAS POWERFUL.

478
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,550
>> EVERYONE GIVES YOU A HUG AND

479
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:02,758
A KISS.

480
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,051
>> RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME IS MY

481
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:07,513
SISTER, WHO LOVES ME

482
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,681
UNCONDITIONALLY, AND IT WAS THE

483
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:16,021
BEST SURPRISE OF THE GAME.

484
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,650
GAME.

485
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:22,987
>> MAN.

486
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,446
WHY COULDN'T SHE MAKE IT,

487
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,197
BECAUSE OF THE BABY?

488
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,782
I'M LOOKING AROUND, LOOKING

489
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:26,991
AROUND.

490
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,075
I WAS LOOKING FOR MY WIFE, AND I

491
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:31,579
DIDN'T SEE MY WIFE.

492
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,830
>> MAN, YOU LOOK LIKE A

493
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:33,497
DIFFERENT MAN.

494
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,000
>> I SEEN MY BEST FRIEND ARNOLD,

495
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,793
AND IT SUCKED BECAUSE I WAS

496
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:38,836
ANTICIPATING MY WIFE,UN.

497
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,461
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING

498
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,379
MY WIFE.

499
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,506
BUT I JUST DON'T THINK SHE COULD

500
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,132
LEAVE A FOUR-MONTH-OLD BABY TO

501
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,508
COME OUT HERE.

502
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,218
IT WAS HARD ENOUGH FOR ME TO DO

503
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,970
IT, BUT I KNOW IT WAS HER MOM'S

504
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:48,137
HANDS.

505
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,306
DID YOU SEE BABY BEFORE YOU GOT

506
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:50,472
HERE?

507
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,640
>> YES, YES.

508
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,308
>> HOW WAS SHE?

509
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,601
>> BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL.

510
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:53,976
GROWN, AWESOME.

511
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,352
WHEN YOU SEE HERK I MEAN, IT'S

512
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,854
GOING TO BE SUCH A CHANGE.

513
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,063
>> ARNOLD TOLD ME EVERYTHING

514
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:02,484
ABOUT MY LITTLE BABY.

515
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,113
HE TOLD ME-- HE TOLD ME THAT MY

516
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,657
BABY IS ALMOST TWICE THE SIZE.

517
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,825
I WAS SO HAPPY TO HEAR THAT.

518
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:12,786
YOU KNOW, MY DAUGHTER IS IN HER

519
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,204
MOM'S HANDS.

520
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,080
I'M AT PEACE.

521
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,374
>> HEY, WOO.

522
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,542
THIS IS MY FRIEND ARNOLD.

523
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,794
>> ARNOLD.

524
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,213
>> MARISSA COULDN'T MAKE TMAN.

525
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,299
>> YOUR WIFE'S DOING WELL, THE

526
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,092
BABY'S DOING AWESOME.

527
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,511
AFTER 37 DAYS OUT HERE, SEE

528
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,597
BLOOD, SEE FAMILY.

529
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,849
THERE'S NOTHING MORE FULFILLING.

530
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:35,809
MY LITTLE COUSIN MIKEY LOOKED

531
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,853
LIKE AN ANGEL.

532
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:41,315
I SAW HIS FACE-- AND YOU JUST

533
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,191
GET PSYCHED.

534
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,901
>> CONGRATS, EVERYBODY.

535
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:44,568
>> FINAL FOUR.

536
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,986
>> CONGRATS, GUYS.

537
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,906
>> CHEERS.

538
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:49,531
>> I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US TO

00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,574
EAT, MAN.

540
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:50,824
>> YEAH.

541
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,535
>> I SEE SOME BREAD.

GRAPE JUICE.

545
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:00,376
OH!

546
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:05,673
IT WAS SO GOOD AND THEN WE HAVE

547
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,675
A FAT THING OF CRUNCHY PEANUT

548
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:08,258
BUTTER I HAVE BEEN DREAMING OF

GO AHEAD AND JUMP RIGHT ON IN.

558
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,899

564
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,991

>> I'M GOING TO WIN THIS

566
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:35,619
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

567
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:39,748
I'M PICTURING IT NOW, SOLE

AND I CAN PICTURE POSING WITH

571
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,089
CHRISTINA HAMILTON, MY LOVELY

572
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,133
GIRLFRIEND, AFTER GETTING

573
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,175
PERMISSION FROM HER MOM AND DAD,

574
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:50,968
OF COURSE.

575
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:51,969
STARTING MY FAMILY.

576
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,345
STARTING A LIFE.

577
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,555
BUT, YOU KNOW, ONE STEP AT A

578
00:16:54,638 --> 00:17:01,019
TIME.

579
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:04,940
>>> YUP.

580
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,066
>> BUT IT'S GONE FAST.

581
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,359
DID IT GO FAST AT HOME?

582
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,485
>> OH, YEAH.

583
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:08,861

00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,447
>> FINAL FOUR.

586
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,030
>> YEAH.

587
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:12,448
>> I'M NOT A GOAT.

588
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,115
I'M JUST HATED.

589
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,367
PEOPLE WILL COME DOWN ON ME,

590
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,243
ESPECIALLY THE WOMEN.

591
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,328
BUT I'M JUST GOING TO ARGUE TO

592
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,038
THE WOMEN THAT I CAME OUT HERE

593
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,249
AND I PLAYED LIKE A MAN, AND YOU

594
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,667
CAN'T FAULT ME FOR THAT.

595
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,127
IF I WERE A MAN AND I MADE ALL

596
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,670
THE MOVES I MADE, I WOULD BE-- I

597
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,463
WOULD BE STRATEGIC.

598
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:31,216
BUT BECAUSE I'M A WOMAN, I'M A

599
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:31,425
BITCH.

600
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:32,301
I DO RESPECT MY HUSBAND AND I

601
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,635
LOVE HIM.

602
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,013
AND I AM THE LAST WOMAN, YOU

603
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:36,221
KNOW.

604
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,390
I GUESS FOR HIM TO SEE THAT

605
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:38,974
PROBABLY SHOWS HIM A DIFFERENT

606
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:39,308
SIDE OF ME.

607
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,226
I'M JUST GOING TO BE LIKE,

608
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,311
"THINK ABOUT IT, GIRLS.

609
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,270
THINK ABOUT IT.

610
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,938
YOU WANT ME TO COME OUT AND BE

611
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:45,564
YOUR MOMMA OR DO YOU WANT ME TO

612
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:46,273
COME OUT AND WIN?

613
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:49,193
WHAT'S THE BETTER ROLE MODEL."

614
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,069
HOPEFULLY PEOPLE WILL GIVE ME

615
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:51,779
CREDIT FOR THAT.

616
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,823
MY HUSBAND KNOWS I'M TENACIOUS.

617
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,117
HE'S SEEN ME BATTLE IN COURT AND

618
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,411
KICK SOME ASS, AND OFTEN CHAOS

619
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,704
IS A PART OF THAT, KEEPING THE

620
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:06,168
OTHER SIDE ON THEIR TOES.

621
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,295
>> I KNOW I'M GOING TO GIVE

622
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,631
EVERYTHING I HAVE, AND I CAN BE

623
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,049
AT PEACE WITH WHAT HAPPENS

624
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,593
BECAUSE I KNOW I'LL LEAVE HAVING

625
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:15,427
TRIED EVERYTHING I CAN TRY.

626
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,303
I HAVE TO GO INTO THIS IMMUNITY

627
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,347
CHALLENGE OUT FOR BLOOD, READY

628
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,265
TO WIN IT'S ALL COSTS BECAUSE

629
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,935
THIS IS IT.

630
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,895
THIS IS MY SHOT AT THE MILLION

631
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,271
DOLLARS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

632
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:26,647
IT'S DO OR DIE.

633
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:32,319
AND I DON'T PLAN ON DYING.

634
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,364
>> Jeff: AND YOU THOUGHT THERE

635
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,407
WASN'T GOING TO BE A LOVED ONE

636
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:37,616
VISIT.

637
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,617
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I GET A LOT

638
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,369
IS WHILE THE FINALE IS GOING ON,

639
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,037
THIS FINAL TWO-HOUR EPISODE,

640
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,622
WHERE ARE THE CONTESTANTS?

00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,165
BASEMENT HERE AT CBS IN THE

00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:45,874
GREEN ROOM.

644
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,669
WE MADE A LITTLE "SURVIVOR"

645
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:48,877
LOUNGE.

646
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:49,461
COME ON IN.

647
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,712
IT'S ONLY THE PLAYERS.

648
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,255
THERE'S NO FAMILY MEMBERS IN

649
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,422
HERE.

650
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,259
WE'VE GOT-- YEAH, WOO TRYING TO

651
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,343
GET A LITTLE CAMERA TIME LIKE HE

00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,344

653
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:01,431

HERE'S THE VIBE IN HERE TONIGHT.

657
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,728
BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE VIBE IS

658
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,729
UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE OF WHAT'S

659
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,897
GONE ON IN THE SHOW, BUT THIS

660
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,315

THINK WE JUST HAD THE RIGHT

665
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:16,530
BALANCE.

666
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,155
THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT GROUPS

667
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,658
OF ALL TIME IN "SURVIVOR.

668
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,952
OF OKAY, WE HAVE IT.

669
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,537

674
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,085
EPIC!

>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

677
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,795
WELCOME, LOVED ONES.

678
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,506
SO, KASS, WHAT IS THAT LIKE TO

679
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,676
SEE YOUR HUSBAND ROLL UP IN A

680
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:19,885
BOAT?

681
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:20,552
>> GREAT SURPRISE.

682
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:24,139
ESPECIALLY FOR ME WHO AS WE ALL

WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR BUD WEYOU?

687
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,312
IS THERE A SENSE OF SAFETY THAT

688
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,688
FOR A MOMENT THERE'S SOMEONE

689
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:32,814
HERE I KNOW I CAN TRUST?

690
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,149
>> OH, ABSOLUTELY, JEFF.

691
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:35,317
I MEAN, EVERYBODY COULD AGREE TO

692
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,401
THAT.

ALLIANCEFROM CHILDHOOD FRIEND

695

FRIENDSHIP IN REAL LIFE IS

696
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:41,406
TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

697
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,158
ALLIANCES HERE, YOU COULD BREAK

698
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:43,325
THEM.

YOU COULD MAKE ALL THE PROMISES

YOU WANT TO ANYBODY YOU DON'T

JEFF.

706
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:51,333

>> COME ON, YOU CAN CATCH THEM!

938
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:34,694
>> Jeff: IT IS A COMPLICATED

939
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:34,903
PUZZLE.

940
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,405
YOU CAN EXPECT NOTHING LESS 37

941
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,406
DAYS INTO THIS GAME.

942
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,908
THERE IS A LOT OF TRIAL AND

943
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:40,992
ERROR.

944
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,202
TONY HASN'T HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS

945
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,036
WITH PUZZLES.

946
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:43,286
KASS BACK.

947
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,747
SHE CAN UNLOCK HER PUZZLE

948
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:45,955
PIECES.

949
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,958
>> IT'S YOUR STRONG SUIT, HONEY.

950
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,960
>> Jeff: KASS IS GOOD AT

951
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:51,920
PUZZLES, BUT SHE'S LOST A TON OF

952
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,798
TIME TO SPENCER, WOO, AND TONY.

953
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:57,884
TONY STILL LOOKING FOR HIS FIRST

>> Jeff: KASS SLOW AND STEADY

959
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,813
LIKE SHE ALWAYS DOES IN PUZZLES.

960
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,232
KASS NEVER PANICS.

961
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,775
TONY AND WOO TEND TO THROW

962
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,653
PIECES AROUND, MAKE QUICKER

963
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:16,861

KASS WITH ANOTHER PIECE.

967
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:21,574
>> YOU'RE GOOD.

968
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,033
THERE YOU GO.

969
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,536
THERE YOU GO.

970
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,328
>> Jeff: KASS WAS COMPLETELY

971
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,163
OUT OF THIS CHALLENGE BUT SHE'S

972
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,498
STILL FIGHTING.

00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:29,874
TONY SWAPS ONE PIECE FOR

974
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:30,125

KASS MAKING SOME PROGRESS NOW,

978
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,301
STARTING TO CLOSE THE GAP.

979
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:40,969
KASS IS DEFINITELY BACK IN THIS

980
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,971

981
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:43,888
BEGINNING.

>> I HAD TO WIN, AND IT MEANT SO

1037
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,988
MUCH, AND SO LOSING IN ITSELF IS

1038
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,741
DEVASTATING, BUT TO LOSE TO A

1039
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:28,368
BRAIN-DEAD WEASEL LIKE KASS.

1040
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,453
THAT'S THE MOST HUMILIATING WAY

1041
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:30,995
I COULD HAVE LOST TODAY.

1042
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:34,499
BUT I CARE TOO MUCH TO GO OUT OF

1043
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:35,083
A GAME LIKE THIS WITHOUT DOING

1044
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,544
EVERYTHING I CAN.

1045
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,630
IT'S TIME TO PLAY MY ASS OFF.

1046
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:58,106
THE BEST PART OF TODAY IS I

1047
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:01,901
GET TO SEND SPENCER HOME.

1048
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,486
AND IT LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD.

1049
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,112
IT GIVES ME A FAR BETTER SHOT AT

1050
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:04,362
WINNING.

1051
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:07,699
>> I'M GLAD YOU GOT A CHANCE TO

1052
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:07,865
WIN.

1053
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,200
>> THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE, KASS.

1054
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:09,617
THAT WAS AWESOME.

1055
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,828
>> MY PLAN WHEN I FLIPPED WAS TO

1056
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,621
TRY TO GO TO THE END WITH TWO

1057
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:13,830
BRAWNS.

1058
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,164
TODAY I SEALED MY FATE.

1059
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,916
I'M GOING WITH TWO BRAWNS, AND I

1060
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,752
FEEL GOOD AGAINST EITHER WOO OR

1061
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:20,295
TONY.

1062
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,129
THE CHALLENGE BEAST IS OUT.

1063
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,047
YOU CAN'T PUT IT WAY.

00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,301
WEAR THAT NECKLACE, AND I CAN'T

IDOL I CAN USE AT IDOL FOYER SO

1070
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:34,809
I STILL FEEL SAFE.

1071
00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:37,395

I WANTED TO WIN ONE CHALLENGE.

1074

>> TONY, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE

1075
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,737
NOW, BUT COULD WE HAVE A

1076
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,738
CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW.

1077
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,448
>> I'M CRYING NOT GETTING A

00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:50,617
SPENCER SAID THAT'S WHAT I WANT

1080
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,871

00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,587
IT IS A FINAL TWO.

1088
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,464

00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,633
>> NOT A GREAT POSITION FOR YOU.

1119
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,009
IF I'M THERE I'M STILL THE

1120
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,427
PERSON PEOPLE WANT OUT.

1121
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,680
IF IT'S ME, YOU AND, KASS, KASS

1122
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:57,100
VOTES ME OUT OVER YOU.

1123
00:32:57,183 --> 00:33:00,186
>> I UNDERSTAND.

1124
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,729
>> I'M TRYING TO MAKE A PITCH TO

1125
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,107
TONE TOW KEEP ME, BELIEVING IT'S

1126
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,566
A FINAL, TWO AND BEING THAT

1127
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,734
THAT'S THE BEST WAY FOR HIM TO

1128
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,445
GET TO THE END.

1129
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,947
WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT IF YOU

1130
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,408
GO WITH WOO AND KASS, IF EITHER

1131
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,660
OF THEM WIN--

1132
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,828
>> I'M OUT.

1133
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,037
>> YOU'RE SCREWED.

1134
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,455
>> IT MAKES SENSE.

1135
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:19,747
>> UH-HUH.

1136
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,500
>> AT FINAL FOUR, A TIE IS A

1137
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,084
FIRE-MAKING COMPETITION.

1138
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,919
A TIE IS A LOT BETTER THAN GOING

1139
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:25,086
HOME.

1140
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,295
IF IT'S A FINAL THREE, I

1141
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,714
WOULDN'T EVEN TRY TO PLEAD A

1142
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:28,965
CASE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE SO

1143
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:29,799
OBVIOUS THEY NEED TO GO.

1144
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:30,383
BUT I REALLY THINK IT MAKES

1145
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,427
SENSE TO TAKE ME.

1146
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,302
ME.

1147
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:37,557
TONY IS MY LAST HOPE.

1148
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:44,981
>> I JUST NEED TO THINK, MAN.

1149
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,441
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK SPENCE IS

1150
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,066
WORKING ON?

1151
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,235
>> PROBABLY WORKING ON GETTING

1152
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,113
ME OUT.

1153
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,240
>> WE WOULD BE STUPID NOT TO GET

1154
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,032
RID OF SPENCE.

1155
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:55,324
>> YEAH.

1156
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,868
>> AND I'M NOT CHANGING MY MIND

1157
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:57,452
ON THAT.

1158
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,328
>> OKAY, COOL.

1159
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:02,999
>> NO MATTER WHAT TONY'S ANTICS

1160
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:03,958
OR SHENANIGANS ARE.

1161
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:05,585
>> I SIT DOWN WITH KASS AND

1162
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,879
SHE'S LIKE, WE'RE VOTING FOR

1163
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:08,296
SPENCER.

1164
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,965
AND I'M LIKE PHEW!

1165
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:11,132
GOOD.

1166
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,675
BUT SPENCER IS STILL MAKING

1167
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,385
MOVES, BEING TIRED, BEING

1168
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:17,346
HUNGRY, BEING THIRSTY, I DON'T

1169
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,639
RECALL WHAT HAPPENS IF IT'S A

1170
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:22,059
TIE IN THE FINAL FOUR, HOW DOES

1171
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,644
THAT WORK?

1172
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,980
I KNOW I WON'T BE ABE TO VOTE.

1173
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:27,440
SPENCER WON'T BE ABE TO VOTE.

1174
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:30,359
THEN IF IT GOES TO ANOTHER TIE,

1175
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,695
THEN, MAN, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

1176
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:36,449
TO DRAW ROCKS?

1177
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,493
THE JURY?

1178
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,119
WE FIGHT FOR IT?

1179
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,662
I DON'T KNOW.

1180
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,540
WHAT HAPPENS?

1181
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:45,875
IS THE FIRST ONE TO BE ABLE TO

1182
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,127
MAKE A FIRE?

1183
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,755
ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN AT TRIBAL

1184
00:34:50,838 --> 00:35:01,682
COUNCIL.

1185
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,309
>> I KNOW I'M VOTING SPENCER.

1186
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,228
AND I KNOW WOO IS VOTING

1187
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:05,728
SPENCER.

1188
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,397
IF TONY AND SPENCER VOTE WOO, IT

1189
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,441
COULD END UP A TIE, WHICH IS

1190
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,820
BROKEN AT THIS STAGE BY A

1191
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,196
FIRE-MAKING CHALLENGE.

1192
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,698
DOES TONY WANT TO FORCE THAT?

1193
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,242
SPENCER WOULD PROBABLY LOVE TO

1194
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,744
TRY THAT OR TRY ANYTHING.

1195
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,704
AND EITHER WAY, IT'S NOT ME.

1196
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,206
SO FIRE OFF, DO WHATEVER YOU

1197
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,208
BOYS WANT TO DO, TO MED WELYOUR

1198
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,002
GAME, BUT I'M SITTING PRETTY AND

1199
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,712
I'M NOT HANDING MY NECKLACE TO

1200
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,757
ANYONE.

1201
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,150
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

1202
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:58,656
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1203
00:35:58,739 --> 00:35:59,323
SARAH.

1204
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,450
MORGAN.

1205
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,994
L.J.

1206
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:04,245
JEREMIAH.

1207
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,705
JEFRA.

1208
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:06,038
TASHA.

1209
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,999
AND TRISH VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

1210
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:11,377
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1211
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,713
ALL RIGHT, SO LET'S TALK ABOUT

1212
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:14,922
TODAY'S CHALLENGE.

1213
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,299
KASS, YOU HAD A COMEBACK THAT IF

1214
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,676
I HADN'T SEEN IT WITH MY OWN

1215
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,428
EYES I WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED

1216
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:20,595
IT.

1217
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,345
>> JEFF, THERE WAS A POINT WHEN

1218
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,055
I WAS THINKING, YOU KNOW, THIS

1219
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,056
CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE OVER,

1220
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,975
AND I'M STILL GOING TO BE STUCK

1221
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,351
UP HERE ON THIS GIANT POLE IN

1222
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,811
THE WATER BECAUSE I AM SCARED TO

1223
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:29,437
DEATH TO JUMP FROM THIS HEIGHT.

1224
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,314
BUT HEARING MY HUSBAND'S VOICE

1225
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:35,026
AND HAVING HIM ENCOURAGE ME, I

1226
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,277
MEAN, JUST HAVING SOMEONE THERE

1227
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,488
CHEERING ME ON, I KNEW IT.

1228
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,240
>> Jeff: TONY, YOU GUYS GOT A

1229
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:41,866
SURPRISE VISIT THIS MORNING FROM

1230
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,242
YOUR LOVED ONES.

1231
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,870
WHAT DID THAT DO TO THE SPIRIT

1232
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:46,162
INSIDE YOU?

1233
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:49,332
>> IT WAS BITTERSWEET, JEFF.

1234
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,792
WE SAW A BOAT PULL UP.

1235
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,544
I'M LOOKING THROUGH THE CROWD

1236
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,713
HOPING TO SEE A SHORT BLOND

1237
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:56,881
GREEN-EYED LADY WHICH IS MY

1238
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,966
WIFE, AND I SEE MY FRIEND.

1239
00:36:59,050 --> 00:36:59,550
BUT I WAS VERY PLEASED TO SEE

1240
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,469
HIM AND IT GIVES YOU A BIG LIFT,

1241
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,470
A HUGE LIFT.

1242
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,264
>> Jeff: SPENCER, THE LOOK OF

1243
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,308
DESPAIR ON YOUR FACE WHEN KASS

1244
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,351
WON THE CHALLENGE TODAY.

1245
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:12,021
IT'S THE FIRST TIME IN 37 DAYS

1246
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:12,855
I'VE SEEN EMOTION IF YOU.

1247
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:13,481
>> TODAY WAS AN EMOTIONAL DAY

1248
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,607
FOR ME.

1249
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,692
I MEAN, THE LOVED ONES.

1250
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:17,318
TONY SAYS IT WAS BITTERSWEET.

1251
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,029
FOR ME, THAT WASN'T THE CASE.

1252
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:22,198
IT SOFTENED ME UP.

1253
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,574
AND MY SISTER SAID IT BEST TODAY

1254
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,701
AT THE CHALLENGE EYE AM

1255
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:25,993
NEUROTIC.

1256
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,955
AND THIS WILL BITE IF I LEAVE

1257
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:32,541
THE GAME TWO DAYS SHORT OF MY

1258
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,793
DREAM.

1259
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,503
>> Jeff: SO WHAT CASE DO YOU

1260
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:35,711
MAKE?

1261
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,630
>> I THINK TONY IS IN A GREAT

1262
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:38,547
SPOT TO WIN.

1263
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:39,423
RIGHT NOW, IF WE'RE LOOKING AT A

1264
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:42,301
FINAL TWO, AND TONY TAKES ME

1265
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,845
OUT, THEN IF KASS WINS OR IF WOO

1266
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:48,099
WINS THE NEXT IMMUNITY, SHOULD

1267
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:50,017
VOTE TONY OUT RIGHT BEHIND ME.

1268
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,269
HOWEVER, IF TONY KEEPS ME IN THE

1269
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:52,853
GAIRNLG VOTES OUT WOO, BECAUSE

1270
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,231
KASS HAS IMMUNITY, THEN IF KASS

1271
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:56,482
WINS OR IF TONY WINS, TONY GETS

1272
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:59,318
TO THAT FINAL TWO.

1273
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,528
AND I WILL SAY, TONY, IN FRONT

1274
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,614
OF THE JURY, IF WE ENDED UP IN A

1275
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,282
SITUATION WHERE I HAD TO CHOOSE

1276
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,367
BETWEEN TAKING YOU AND SOMEONE

1277
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,327
ELSE TO THE END, I WOULD TAKE

1278
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,621
YOU, AND I WOULD ASK THE JURY DO

1279
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:10,997
NOT VOTE FOR ME.

1280
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,290
I WILL TAKE MYSELF OUT OF THE

1281
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,918
RUNNING, IF I DID NOT HONOR

1282
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:16,127
THAT.

1283
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,712
>> THE WAY IT IS NOW, I WOULD BE

1284
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:18,629
NERVOUS TO GO TO THE END WITH

1285
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:18,796
YOU.

1286
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,798
>> I THINK YOU WOULD BEAT ME

1287
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,008
HANDILY, TONY.

1288
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,217
YOU PLAYED THE BETTER GAME.

1289
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,760
>> Jeff: WOO, HOW ABOUT FOR

1290
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:24,927
YOU?

1291
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:25,553
YOU'RE EITHER A PERFECT PERSON

1292
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,014
TO TAKE TO THE END BECAUSE THE

1293
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,473
STORY WILL BE WHAT DID WOO DO?

1294
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,850
OR YOU'RE THE WORST PERSON TO

1295
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,435
TAKE TO THE END BECAUSE YOU

1296
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,770
HAVEN'T OFFENDED ANYBODY.

1297
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,439
>> I'VE BEEN A PLAYER.

1298
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:39,191
I'VE JUST BEEN A LITTLE MORE

1299
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,151
INCONSPICUOUS BECAUSE I'M NOT

1300
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,737
VERY OUTSPOKEN, BUT I'VE BEEN AN

1301
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,488
INSTRUMENTAL PART IN THOSE BIG

1302
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:44,697
MOVES.

1303
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,531
>> Jeff: KASS, YOU'RE REALLY

1304
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:46,699
IN AN INTERESTING SITUATION.

1305
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:50,870
YOU ARE A PART OF THIS THREESOME

1306
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:52,329
WITH TONEY AND WOO, BUT YOU

1307
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,330
STARTED THE GAME WITH SPENCER.

1308
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,124
YOU HAVE IMMUNITY AROUND YOUR

1309
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:55,332
NECK.

1310
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,168
SO IT GIVES YOU SOME FREEDOM TO

1311
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,544
SIT BACK AND SAY I HAVE ONE

1312
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,921
BULLET IN THIS GUN.

1313
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,381
I AM GOING TO TAKE AT SHOT AND

1314
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,717
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

1315
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,887
>> I LOVE OPTIONS JEFF.

1316
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,890
WE CAN'T GET RID OF TONY

1317
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:11,098
TONIGHT.

1318
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:11,682
WOO IS A POTENTIALLY LIKABLE

1319
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,226
PLAIB PLAIR THAT HASN'T BURNED

1320
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,146
ANY BRIDGES AND HASN'T LIED TO

1321
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:17,396
ANYONE.

1322
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,397
SO IF IT'S A BITTER JURY, WOO

1323
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,065
WILL WIN.

1324
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,484
IF IT'S NOT A BITTER JURY, TONY

1325
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,986
OR I HAVE A SHOT.

1326
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:24,570
>> Jeff: IS THERE A PART OF

1327
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:27,281
YOU CONCERNED, TONY, IF THERE IS

1328
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:28,407
ANOTHER TRIBAL, YOU MOEB THE

1329
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:28,616
TARGET.

1330
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,826
>> WELL--

1331
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,077
>> YES.

1332
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,162
>> KASS, DO YOU THINK YOU COULD

1333
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,747
BEAT ME OVER WOO?

1334
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,998
>> I HAVE A BETTER CHANCE

1335
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,000
AGAINST WOO, I THINK.

1336
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:41,087
NOT TONY.

1337
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:46,258
>> WHOA!

1338
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:49,095
>> OH, SNAP.

1339
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:49,845
OH, SNAP.

1340
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:50,221
ALL RIGHT.

1341
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:50,805
SO, YEAH, THAT MAKES ME THE

1342
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,057
TARGET OF ELIMINATION FOR THE

1343
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:53,349
NEXT ROUND.

1344
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:53,891
>> RIGHT.

1345
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:56,143
>> WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT HE'S

1346
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:56,435
SAYING.

1347
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,603
>> IF WOO HAD HIS HEAD ON

1348
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,438
STRAIGHT, HE WOULD TAKE KASS

1349
00:39:59,522 --> 00:39:59,688
OVER YOU.

1350
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,024
KASS IS EASIER TO BEAT THAN YOU

1351
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,359
ARE, AND KASS WOULD TAKE WOO

1352
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:04,735
OVER YOU, MEANING YOU WOULD HAVE

1353
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:08,531
TO WIN IMMUNITY.

1354
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:08,989
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1355
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,158
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1356
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:26,423
KASS, YOU'RE UP.

1357
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,678
>> I MADE THE ONLY ARGUMENT I

1358
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:33,681
COULD MAKE.

1359
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,151
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1360
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:52,658
VOTES.

1361
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,869
>> JEFF.

1362
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,204
I JUST WANT TO EXPLAIN THE

1363
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:57,621
SPECIAL IDOL.

1364
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,416
IT SAYS THIS IDOL CAN BE PLAYED

1365
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:06,130
AFTER THE VOTE ARE READ.

1366
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,048
THAT'S THE SPECIAL POWERS THAT

1367
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:08,841
THIS IDOL HAS.

1368
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,384
HOWEVER IT CAN ONLY BE PLAYED

1369
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:12,178
WITH FIVE REMAINING PLAYERS

1370
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:12,386
LEFT.

1371
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:13,596
THAT'S THE LAST TIME I CAN PLAY

1372
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:13,929
IT.

1373
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:14,555
TODAY THERE ARE ONLY FOUR, SO

1374
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,433
THIS IDOL IS ABSOLUTELY USELESS

1375
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:17,683
TONIGHT.

1376
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,059
SO THE WAY I USED IT TONIGHT IS

1377
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,603
BY WEARING IT AROUND MY NECK.

1378
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:21,687
IF MY NAME APPEARS THREE TIMES,

1379
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,981
I'M GOING HOME TONIGHT.

1380
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:27,568
I HOPE THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

1381
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,111
>> Jeff: OKAY.

1382
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,780
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1383
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:32,698
FIRST VOTE.

1384
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:38,495
SPENCER.

1385
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:39,121
WOO.

1386
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:44,877
ONE VOTE SPENCER, ONE VOTE WOO.

1387
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,085
SPENCER.

1388
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,129
THAT'S TWO VOTES SPENCER, ONE

1389
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:47,880
VOTE WOO.

1390
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:56,305
ONE VOTE LEFT.

1391
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:56,847
14th PERSON VOTED OUT AND

1392
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:02,311
THE EIGHTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

1393
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:02,561
SPENCER.

1394
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:14,448
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1395
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:17,076
SPENCER, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1396
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,369
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1397
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:25,042
>> ADIOS.

1398
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,674
>> Jeff: WELL, CONGRATULATIONS

1399
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:35,636
ON MAKING IT TO THE FINAL THREE.

1400
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,471
TOMORROW, YOU'LL COMPETE IN YOUR

1401
00:42:37,554 --> 00:42:37,972
FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

1402
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:42,184
TRY TO GET SOME SLEEP.

1403
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,894
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

1404
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:44,603
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1405
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:49,984
GOOD NIGHT.

1406
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:50,609
>> I GAVE THE ONLY ARGUMENT I

1407
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,278
COULD AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1408
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:52,778
IT WAS TOUGH.

1409
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:55,906
I'M HEATED.

1410
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,242
"SURVIVOR" ISN'T A GAME FOR ME.

1411
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:58,826
"SURVIVOR "IS A APPROXIMATION

1412
00:42:58,909 --> 00:42:59,910
FOR ME.

1413
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,996
SO 37 DAYS OF "SURVIVOR" BEING

1414
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:02,705
MY LIFE AND THAT BEING OVER IS A

1415
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:03,706
TOUGH PILL TO SWALLOW.

1416
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,833
I THINK I LEARNED A LOT FROM THE

1417
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,459
GAME, AND SOMETHING CAN COME OF

1418
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:12,131
THIS MISERY THAT WAS "SURVIVOR."

1419
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,099
YOU'RE FEELING AT HOME, BUT WE

1420
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:26,186
HAVE AN EXCITED AUDIENCE.

1421
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,272
BUT I WAS GOING TO SAY WE HAVE A

1422
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:29,732
LOT OF DISAPPOINTED PEOPLE IN

1423
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,650
THE HOUSE BECAUSE SPENCER WAS

1424
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,402
ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR PLAISHZ

1425
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,278
THIS SEASON.

1426
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,989
YOU SAW HIM WALKING OUT OF

1427
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:37,197
TRIBAL.

1428
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,365
AND I GET THIS QUESTION A LOT--

1429
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,325
THEY'RE WALKING.

1430
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:39,950
WHERE ARE THEY GO?

1431
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,660
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S LITERALLY WHAT

1432
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,912
HAPPENS SECONDS AFTER THEY ARE

1433
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:44,580
VOTED OUT.

1434
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:45,748
TAKE A LOOK.

1435
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,791
>> I'M A LITTLE FIRED PUP.

1436
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,294
I FEEL LIKE I COULD HAVE DONE

1437
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:51,712
BETTER AND SHOULD HAVE DONE

1438
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:51,920
BETTER.

1439
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:53,255
>> 136.

1440
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,340
>> WHAT!

1441
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:55,341
>> BLOOD PRESSURE, HEART RATE.

1442
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:58,260
>> THE LAST TIME I WEIGHED 136,

1443
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,720
I PROBABLY HADN'T KISSED A GIRL

1444
00:43:59,803 --> 00:43:59,887
YET.

1445
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,890
>> Jeff: WE ARE WITH JOANNIE,

1446
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,308
SPENCER'S MOM.

1447
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,477
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).

1448
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,895
I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION.

1449
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:11,023
SPENCER AND I HAVE HAD A FUN,

1450
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:11,607
VOLATILE RELATIONSHIP, BUT DID

1451
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,942
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHEN HE

1452
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,486
FINALLY GOT ON THAT HE WOULD

1453
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:15,861
LAST THIS LONG?

1454
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:18,155
>> WHEN HE LEFT TO GO TO THE

1455
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:19,323
AIRPORT, KAREN AND I LOOKED AT

1456
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:20,532
EACH OTHER AND SAID HE'S GOING

1457
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:21,116
TO BE ONE OF THE FIRST TO GO.

1458
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,911
>> Jeff: WHICH IS WHAT I

1459
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:24,119
THOUGHT.

1460
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:24,286
OOB.

1461
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,830
BUT YOU HATE TO SEE HIM GO, BUT

1462
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,040
THAT'S WHY WINNING IS SO SWEET

1463
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,500
BECAUSE THIS GAME IS SOATIVELY.

1464
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:30,876
YOU GUYS ARE NOT FROM CA

1465
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:35,339
>> I'M FROM TULSA, OKLAHOMA AND

1466
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,965
WE DROVE OVER 24 HOURS TO GET

1467
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:37,174
HERE.

1468
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:38,801
>> Jeff: THAT'S A "SURVIVOR"

1469
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:39,843
FAN.

1470
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,136
ADAM, ONE OF OUR SOLDIERS,

1471
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,013
FOUGHT IN AFGHANISTAN.

1472
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:47,810
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

1473
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,437
SEVERELY INJURED.

1474
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,897
YOU HAD 120 SURGERIES?

1475
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,690
>> ROUGHLY, JEFF, YES.

1476
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:54,274
>> Jeff: AND IS THIS TRUE, OR

1477
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:54,942
ARE YOU JUST SAYING THAT?

1478
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,820
PART OF YOUR RECOVERY WAS

1479
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:00,864
BONDING WITH YOUR FAMILY OVER

1480
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:01,156

HE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE IT AGAIN

1815
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,507
>> Jeff: CONGRATS.

1816
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:26,966
>> IF YOU'RE IN THE OLYMPICS,

1817
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,094
AND YOU RUN THE MARATHON, AND

1818
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:31,221
YOU LOSE BY HALF A SECOND,

1819
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:33,431
THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

1820
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:34,849
IT'S CRAZY.

1821
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,142
AND I NEEDED IT.

1822
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,144
I NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS

1823
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,813
DECISION.

1824
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,022
I THINK WOO MIGHT BE ABLE TO

1825
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:41,356
BEAT ME.

1826
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:42,398
I DON'T KNOW.

1827
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,109
I HOPE HE THINKS SO.

1828
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,616
>> Jeff: THAT WAS PROBABLY THE

1829
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:54,077
CLOSEST FINISH IN "SURVIVOR"

1830
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:54,327
HISTORY.

1831
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:55,495
IT TRULY WAS LESS THAN HALF A

1832
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,622
SECOND, AND IT WOULD BE A

1833
00:56:57,705 --> 00:57:00,166
MILLION-DOLLAR WIN FOR WOO IF HE

1834
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,085
CHOOSES THE RIGHT PERSON TO TAKE

1835
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:02,919
TO THE END.

1836
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:06,589
WHO DO YOU TAKE IF YOU'RE WOO?

1837
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:10,927
>> PROBABLY KASS BECAUSE

1838
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,053
NOBODY-- I THINK NOBODY REALLY

1839
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:14,764
HAS RESPECT FOR HER.

1840
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,641
>> Jeff: GOOD JOB.

1841
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:19,602
YOU'D BE GREAT AT TRIBAL

1842
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:19,853
COUNCIL.

1843
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:20,478
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING?

1844
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:21,646
>> PROBABLY SINCE I WAS EIGHT,

1845
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:23,189
SO, LIKE, THREE YEARS.

1846
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:23,648
>> Jeff: THREE YEARS.

1847
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:23,982
( LAUGHTER ).

1848
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:26,693
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SO THAT

1849
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:27,360
MEANS YOU'RE 11.

1850
00:57:27,443 --> 00:57:28,444
>> UH-HUH.

1851
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:29,863
>> Jeff: JUST CHECKING MY

1852
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:30,155
MATH.

1853
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,447
DO YOU WATCH OLD EPISODES

1854
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:31,698
ONLINE.

1855
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:35,618
>> ON iTUNES, IF I'M BORED OR

1856
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:35,827
SICK.

1857
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:36,536
>> Jeff: ARE YOU GUYS

1858
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:37,078
BASICALLY CAUGHT UP WITH THE

1859
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:39,247
HISTORY OF "SURVIVOR?"

1860
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:39,497
>> YES.

1861
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:40,540
>> Jeff: EVEN THOUGH THE SHOW

1862
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,959
WAS ON LONG BEFORE MOST OF YOU

1863
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:43,668
GUYS WERE BORN ONE YEAR BEFORE

1864
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:45,336
YOU WERE BORN?

1865
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,339
THIS IS WHY I LOVE "SURVIVOR."

1866
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,090
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PART OF

1867
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:49,716
THE JOB, TRULY, MEETING KIDS

1868
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,551
LIKE THIS WHO LOVE ADVENTURE.

1869
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:54,429
AND I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF

1870
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:56,097
YOU AT HOME TONIGHT WHO ARE THE

1871
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:57,348
SAME AGE.

1872
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,850
YOU'RE DIEHARD FANS.

1873
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,393
YOU CAN SMELL THE CAMPED FIRE ON

1874
00:58:00,476 --> 00:58:02,437
YOUR CLOTHES, TASTE THE RICE,

1875
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,355
BUT YOU'RE NOT QUITE OLD ENOUGH

1876
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:04,564
YET.

1877
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:05,773
REMEMBER, MALCOLM, COCHRAN,

1878
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:06,858
THOSE GUYS.

1879
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:07,817
THEY WERE LITTLE KIDS.

1880
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,444
WE LASTED LONG ENOUGH FOR THEM.

1881
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:10,737
AND IF WE STAY ON LONG ENOUGH,

1882
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,739
WHO KNOWS YOU MIGHT JUST GET THE

1883
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,408
CHANCE, AND I HAVE TO SAY THIS,

1884
00:58:15,491 --> 00:58:16,826
I CANNOT WAIT TO SNUFF YOUR

1885
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:17,035
TORCH.

1886
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:17,660
AND THAT GOES FOR YOU GUYS, TOO.

1887
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:21,289
ALL RIGHT, THE FINAL TRIBAL IS

1888
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:21,497
NEXT.

1889
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:25,335
39 DAYS COMES TO A HEAD.

1890
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,420
GOOD JOB!

1891
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,025
>> NICE JOB, WOO.

1892
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:49,484
>> THANK YOU.

1893
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:51,361
>> HALF A SECOND, I WAS TURNING

1894
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:54,948
WHILE YOU WERE TURNING.

1895
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:58,034
>> GROWING UP IN TAIWAN DOUGH, I

1896
00:58:58,117 --> 00:58:58,701
WON JUNIOR OLYMPIC

1897
00:58:58,785 --> 00:58:59,035
CHAMPIONSHIPS.

1898
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,162
I WON NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS.

1899
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:03,081
I WON GRAND CHAMPIONSHIP.

1900
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:04,249
THIS RIGHT HERE, MY FRIEND,

1901
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:04,999
DEFINITELY TAKES THE CAKE.

1902
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,960
I WON THE ULTIMATE PRIZE.

1903
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:07,627
YES!

1904
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:07,835
STOKED!

1905
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,797
>> BUT NOW IT'S SCRAMBLE TIME.

1906
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,965
>> BOY, YOU'RE GOING TO BE A

1907
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:13,633
BUSY MAN TODAY, MY FRIEND.

1908
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:15,093
VERY BUSY MAN.

1909
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:15,677
>> I WAS PSYCHED TO BE WEARING

1910
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,888
THIS, BUT THEN AGAIN, I GOT KIND

1911
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:22,016
OF THIS UNEASY FEELING IN MY

1912
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,476
STOMACH LIKE, MAN, THE FACT THAT

1913
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:26,271
I NOW HAVE TO CHOOSE EITHER TONY

1914
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:29,315
OR KASS TO COME WITH ME, IT'S SO

1915
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:29,482
NUTS.

1916
00:59:29,565 --> 00:59:31,109
>> WOO, ARE WE READY?

1917
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:33,736
LET'S GO FOR A WALK MY MAN.

1918
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,322
I HAVE TO POLITIC RIGHT NOW.

1919
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,824
>> HERE I AM DAY 38 AND NOW MY

1920
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:40,451
DESTINY LIES IN WOO'S HAND.

1921
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:41,077
MY BACK IS UP AGAINST THE WALL.

1922
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,663
HE IS NOT GOING TO BE SO EASY TO

1923
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,248
CONVINCE TO VOTE AGAINST KASS.

1924
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:47,000
I'LL EXPLAIN WHY YOU HAVE EVERY

1925
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,459
REASON TO BE NERVOUS ABOUT GOING

1926
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:48,918
WITH KASS.

1927
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,378
THERE'S NO TRICKERY HERE.

1928
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:52,088
YOU'RE IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT, MY

1929
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:52,547
MAN.

1930
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:53,256
NOTHING CAN HAPPEN TO YOU FROM

1931
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:54,215
THIS POINT ON.

1932
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:54,924
YOU'RE GOOD.

1933
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,551
SO I WANT TO BE AS SUBTLE, AS

1934
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:58,177
SOFT AS I CAN, BUT AT THE SAME

1935
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,137
TIME, AGGRESSIVE.

1936
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,139
I'M JUST PLANTING THE SEEDS ONCE

1937
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:01,347
AGAIN.

1938
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:08,062
HOPING SOMETHING CATCHES.

1939
01:00:12,608 --> 01:00:15,653
YOU'RE A TAE KWON DO INSTRUCTOR

1940
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:16,863
YOU HAVE INTEGRITY, AND LOYALTY.

1941
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:18,781
YOU WERE LOYAL TO ME FROM DAY

1942
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:19,824
ONE.

1943
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:21,743
YOU CAN SAY YOU WERE LOYAL, AND

1944
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:23,786
HONOR AND INTEGRITY.

1945
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:24,912
IF YOU'RE IN CONTROL, IF YOU'RE

1946
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:26,706
IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT, AND YOU

1947
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,417
TAKE KASS, YOU HAVE ZERO CHANCE

1948
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:29,792
OF WINNING.

1949
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,627
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT OR NO?

1950
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:32,378
>> WHY IS THAT?

1951
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,671
>> KASS HAS STORIES.

1952
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,757
SHE DID STUFF, EVEN THOUGH THEY

1953
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:36,883
WERE WRONG MOVES, BUT SHE

1954
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:37,091
PLAYED.

1955
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:37,800
SHE PLAYED THE GAME, AS OPPOSED

1956
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:38,843
TO YOU DIDN'T.

1957
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:40,887
TAKING SOMEONE LIKE KASS,

1958
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:41,429
THINKING YOU'RE GOING TO RUN

1959
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:43,931
AWAY WITH IT IS GOING TO BE YOUR

1960
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:44,182
DEMISE.

1961
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:44,807
YOU HAVE A BETTER SHOT TAKING ME

1962
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:45,683
THAN YOU DO WITH KASS.

1963
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:49,103
THAT'S HOW THE GAME GOES.

1964
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:51,481
THAT'S HOW THE GAME GOES, WOO.

1965
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,399
MY ARGUMENT TO WOO IS A PRETTY

1966
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:53,858
VALID ARGUMENT.

1967
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:56,569
WOO HAS BASED HIS GAME AROUND

1968
01:00:56,652 --> 01:00:57,153
LOYALTY, HONOR, INTEGRITY, AND

1969
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:59,864
SO I'M TELL HIM, WOO, FINAL TWO,

1970
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:00,907
FOR TO YOU OUST ME NOW.

1971
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,867
YOU JUST THREW YOUR GAME PLAN

1972
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:04,285
OUT THE WINDOW.

1973
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,245
>> TONY, I RESPECT YOU IN A BIG

1974
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:06,412
WAY.

1975
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:07,538
AND I'M GOING TO CONSIDER

1976
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:07,955
EVERYTHING YOU SAY.

1977
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:08,373
>> I KNOW.

1978
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:10,124
>> I CAN'T GIVE YOU MY WORD NOW.

1979
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:10,833
>> YOU DON'T NEED TO.

1980
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:13,294
YOU DON'T NEED TO, BRO.

1981
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:14,837
>> I'LL DEFINITELY THINK ABOUT

1982
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:15,004
IT.

1983
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:15,797
>> IS HE BUYING IT?

1984
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,091
I WOULDN'T BUY IT.

1985
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:22,637
I'D TAKE MY CHANCES WITH KASS.

1986
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,389
>> REMEMBER WHAT TONY'S BEEN

1987
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:25,515
TELLING YOU THIS WHOLE TIME IS

1988
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:27,100
TAKE KASS, TAKE KASS, BECAUSE WE

1989
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:28,059
CAN BEAT HER.

1990
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:28,267
RIGHT?

1991
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:29,685
>> I HEAR THAT.

1992
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:30,228
>> WHY WOULD HIS REASONING

1993
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:30,728
CHANGE RIGHT NOW.

1994
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,397
>> UH-HUH.

1995
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,441
>> HE CARRIED ME ALL THIS WAY

1996
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,485
BECAUSE HE KNEW I'M UNLIKABLE.

1997
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:40,071
TO ME, YOU ARE LIKE FABIO RIGHT

1998
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:40,405
NOW.

1999
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:43,116
YOU HAVEN'T REALLY HURT ANYBODY.

2000
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:43,908
NOBODY REALLY KNOWS YOU.

2001
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:45,701
EVERYBODY HATES ME.

2002
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:47,620
BUT IF GUWITH TONY, TONY'S GOING

2003
01:01:47,703 --> 01:01:49,831
TO SAY, "I PULLED HIM ALONG.

2004
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:50,790
WE HURT THE SAME PEOPLE, BUT I

2005
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,751
MADE THE MOVES.

2006
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,711
WHY SHOULD HE GET THE MONEY WHEN

2007
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:56,129
I DID ALL THE WORK."

2008
01:01:56,212 --> 01:02:00,258
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY IF I WAS

2009
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:00,466
TONY.

2010
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,844
IF I'M ON THERE, I'M VOTING FOR

2011
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:03,052
TONY.

2012
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:06,764
BECAUSE HE PLAYED THE BEST GAME.

2013
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:10,518
WOO IS LIKE A CUTE SURFER DUDE,

2014
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:11,519
AWESOME, COOL.

2015
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:12,145
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

2016
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:14,063
HOW DO I SPELL THEIR NAME?

2017
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,482
THIS IS SO INSANE RIGHT NOW.

2018
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,568
BUT I HEAR YOU 100%.

2019
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:19,277
>> YEAH.

2020
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:19,944
IT'S HORRIFYING.

2021
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:21,362
THE PERSON WHO HASN'T MADE A

2022
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:22,697
DECISION THE WHOLE GAME IS IN

2023
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,616
CHARGE OF MY FATE.

2024
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:26,242
>> I'M GOING TO TELL YOU EXACTLY

2025
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:28,119
WHAT I TOLD TONY.

2026
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:31,330
I'M GOING TO TAKE A DAY TO THINK

2027
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:34,000
ABOUT THE PROS AND CONS OF BOTH

2028
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:37,336
ARGUMENTS, AND I'LL JUST MAKE MY

2029
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,045
DECISIONA TRIBAL COUNCIL

2030
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:38,296
TONIGHT.

2031
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:39,505
>> I RESPECT THAT.

2032
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,924
I WANT WOO TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR

2033
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:44,177
HIM, WHICH IS TO TAKE ME.

2034
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,845
IF HE UNDERSTANDS HOW PEOPLE

2035
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:48,890
THINK, TAKING ME IS HIS BETTER

2036
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:51,058
OPTION.

2037
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:57,690
REALLY.

2038
01:02:57,773 --> 01:02:58,983
>> I WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE

2039
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:00,818
SITTING AT THE END WITH TONY.

2040
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,028
THIS IS THE GUY I STARTED WITH.

2041
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:05,031
THIS IS THE GUY I COMMITTED

2042
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:06,991
MYSELF WITH.

2043
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:07,950
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, LIKE,

2044
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:12,330
TAKING TONY MEANS MY CHANCES OF

2045
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:14,957
WINNING ARE NOT SO GREAT.

2046
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,751
OH, BRO.

2047
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:19,086
IF I TAKE SOMEONE LIKE KASS, YOU

2048
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,214
KNOW, AND I BREAK MY LOYALTY

2049
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:23,049
WITH TONY, IT COMPLETELY

2050
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,967
CONTRADICTS WHO I AM.

2051
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:28,930
AND I BECOME THE BIGGEST

2052
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:29,222
HYPOCRITE.

2053
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:30,640
SO IT'S TOUGH.

2054
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:32,016
I WANT TO BE A SOLE SURVIVOR.

2055
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:38,189
AND TO HAVE A MILLION DOLLARS.

2056
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:04,340
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

2057
01:04:04,423 --> 01:04:08,219
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

2058
01:04:08,302 --> 01:04:09,053
SARA, MORGAN.

2059
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:11,639
L.J.

2060
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:12,014
JEREMIAH.

2061
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:13,057
JEFRA.

2062
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:15,268
TASHA.

2063
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:15,434
TRISH.

2064
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:18,646
AND SPENCER, VOTED OUT AT THE

2065
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:21,899
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

2066
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:24,068
SO, WOORKS AT THE LAST TRIBAL

2067
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:25,278
COUNCIL, TONY IN PARTICULAR HAD

2068
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:27,530
A BIG DECISION-- STAY TRUE TO

2069
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:28,614
YOU, SOMEBODY HE'S PLAYED THE

2070
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,491
GAME WITH GOING BACK TO DAY ONE.

2071
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:32,201
OR GET RID OF YOU AND TAKE HIS

2072
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:32,952
CHANCES WITH SPENCER.

2073
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,287
HE STAYED TRUE TO YOU.

2074
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,622
AND TODAY YOU MADE HIM PAY FOR

2075
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:36,789
IT.

2076
01:04:36,872 --> 01:04:37,915
HOW DID THAT FEEL IN THAT MOMENT

2077
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:41,252
WHEN YOU KNEW I'D LOCKED IN A

2078
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:43,212
SPOT IN THE FINAL TRIBAL

2079
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:43,462
COUNCIL?

2080
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:45,131
>> AMAZING, JEFF.

2081
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:47,300
I KNEW THAT IF THERE'S ONE DAY I

2082
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:48,092
NEEDED TO DO WELL AT A PUZZLE,

2083
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:51,012
IT WAS TODAY.

2084
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:52,930
AND TO BE ABLE TO WEAR THIS

2085
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:55,641
TONIGHT, I'M-- I'M ABSOLUTELY

2086
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:55,850
HONORED.

2087
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:56,851
I'M GRATEFUL.

2088
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:59,270
I'M NERVOUS.

2089
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:00,855
>> Jeff: DO YOU THINK LAST

2090
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:02,773
NIGHT'S VOTE WAS A TESTAMENT

2091
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,025
FROM TONY TO YOU ABOUT LOYALTY

2092
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:06,777
OR DO YOU THINK IT WAS STRICTLY

2093
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:07,028
STRATEGY?

2094
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:08,362
>> I THINK TONY'S VOTE LAST

2095
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:13,242
NIGHT WAS STRATEGIC, BUT FOR THE

2096
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,035
MOST PART, HIS LOYALTY AND

2097
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:16,871
COMMITMENT TO ME.

2098
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:18,914
>> Jeff: TONY, HINDSIGHT IS

2099
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:19,707
ALWAYS 20/20.

2100
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:21,626
DID YOU SPEND ANY TIME THINKING,

2101
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:23,169
HOW MIGHT THIS HAVE GONE DOWN IF

2102
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,004
I WOULD HAVE BETRAYED MY LOYALTY

2103
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:26,130
TO WOO AND TOOK MY SHOT WITH

2104
01:05:26,213 --> 01:05:26,339
SPENCER?

2105
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:28,674
>> I MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT

2106
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:29,675
ANSWER AFTER TONIGHT, BUT FOR

2107
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:30,217
NOW I'M GOING TO ANSWER NO.

2108
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:33,304
THIS IS THE EXACT SCENARIO THAT

2109
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:34,805
SPENCER PROPOSED TO ME.

2110
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:36,807
HE SAID IF WOO WINS IMMUNITY,

2111
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:37,308
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE, TONY.

2112
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:39,226
TONIGHT IS GOING TO BE THE

2113
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:39,435
NIGHT.

2114
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:40,227
I WAS LOYAL TO WOO.

2115
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:42,146
I KNOW WOO'S GAME PLAY WAS

2116
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:43,022
LOYALTY, NOT TO EVERYBODY ELSE

2117
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:45,816
BUT TO ME DAY ONE.

2118
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,693
HERE WE ARE, DAY 38.

2119
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,362
IT'S HIS TIME TO SHINE.

2120
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,572
>> Jeff: KASS, IT WAS PROBABLY

2121
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:54,408
LESS THAN ONE SECOND THAT

2122
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:56,202
SEPARATED YOU AND WOO AT THE

2123
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:56,410
FINISH.

2124
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:57,953
>> I BELIEVE YOU SAID IT WAS A

2125
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:01,165
HALF A SECOND.

2126
01:06:01,248 --> 01:06:04,585
UMM, I HAVE RELIVED THAT

2127
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:05,378
CHALLENGE ALL AFTERNOON.

2128
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:06,170
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS I COULD

2129
01:06:06,253 --> 01:06:09,048
HAVE DONE TO MAKE UP A

2130
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:09,340
MILLISECOND.

2131
01:06:09,423 --> 01:06:10,841
BUT I CAN'T GO BACK.

2132
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:11,217
I MEAN, I'M HERE.

2133
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:15,012
AND WOO WON, AND HE WON FAIR AND

2134
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:15,846
SQUARE.

2135
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,056
AND IT WAS EXCRUCIATING.

2136
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:18,933
IT'S BEEN A ROUGH AFTERNOON.

2137
01:06:19,016 --> 01:06:19,850
>> Jeff: WHAT'S BEEN THE

2138
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:20,476
ROUGHEST PART, THE REPLAYING OR

2139
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:21,227
THE WONDERING NOW WHAT'S GOING

2140
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,853
TO HAPPEN?

2141
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:24,438
MY FATE IS NOT IN MY HANDS?

2142
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:25,147
>> THE LOSS OF CONTROL OF YOUR

2143
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:28,067
OWN FATE.

2144
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,986
YOU JUST FEEL SICK ALL

2145
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:31,237
AFTERNOON.

2146
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,279
YOU KNOW, WHAT'S GOING TO

2147
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:32,530
HAPPEN?

2148
01:06:32,613 --> 01:06:33,823
WHAT'S WOO GOING TO DO?

2149
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:35,616
IS HE LOYAL TO TONY TO THE POINT

2150
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:40,287
OF POTENTIALLY LOSING A MILLION

2151
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:40,538
DOLLARS?

2152
01:06:40,621 --> 01:06:41,872
>> Jeff: SO WOO WERE YOU

2153
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:43,207
APPROACHED BY BOTH KASS AND TONY

2154
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:43,416
TODAY?

2155
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:44,166
>> YES.

2156
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:44,709
>> Jeff: EXPECTED, RIGHT?

2157
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:45,042
>> RIGHT.

2158
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:48,379
>> Jeff: AND WHAT WERE THEIR

2159
01:06:48,462 --> 01:06:51,257
BASIC PITCHES?

2160
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:56,804
>> YOU MIND IF I GO OFF SUBJECT?

2161
01:06:56,887 --> 01:06:57,138
>> Jeff: YEAH.

2162
01:06:57,221 --> 01:07:01,100
>> OKAY, I HOPE THESE TWO WILL

2163
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:01,600
UNDERSTAND MY DECISION.

2164
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:05,104
AND I JUST WANT TO GET TO THE

2165
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:06,522
VOTE.

2166
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:08,065
>> Jeff: YOU DON'T EVEN WANT

2167
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:11,694
TO HEAR FROM KASS AND TONY.

2168
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:12,695
ALL RIGHT.

2169
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:13,279
HERE'S HOW THE VOTE WILL WORK.

2170
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:15,948
NOBODY CAN VOTE FOR WOO, WHICH

2171
01:07:16,031 --> 01:07:17,533
MEANS KASS YOU CAN ONLY VOTE FOR

2172
01:07:17,616 --> 01:07:18,242
TONY, TONY CAN ONLY VOTE FOR

2173
01:07:18,325 --> 01:07:18,451
KASS.

2174
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,786
YOUR VOTES CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT

2175
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,079
SO YOU WON'T VOTE.

2176
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:23,164
THE ONLY PUBLISH VOTING IS YOU,

2177
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:23,330
WOO.

2178
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:25,916
YOU'RE VOTING OUT THE 15th

2179
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,418
PERSON OF THE GAME, THE NINTH

2180
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:28,669
PERSON OF THE JURY, AND YOU'LL

2181
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:29,295
BE DECIDING WHO YOU'RE GOING TO

2182
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:31,046
SIT WITH TOMORROW AT FINAL

2183
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:31,422
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

2184
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:34,133
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

2185
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:50,816
WOO, YOU'RE UP.

2186
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:12,171
>> Jeff: I'LL GO GET THE VOTE.

2187
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:14,465
ONCE THE VOTE IS READ, THE

2188
01:08:14,548 --> 01:08:15,257
DECISION IS FINAL.

2189
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:16,634
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE

2190
01:08:16,717 --> 01:08:17,676
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

2191
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,178
COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

2192
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:26,310
I'LL READ THE VOTE.

2193
01:08:26,393 --> 01:08:27,228
15th PERSON VOTED OUT AND

2194
01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:29,188
THE NINTH AND FINAL MEMBER OF

2195
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:33,567
OUR JURY KASS.

2196
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:40,032
BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

2197
01:08:40,115 --> 01:08:47,206
>> THANK YOU, WOO, MAN.

2198
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,792
>> Jeff: KASS, THE TRIBE HAS

2199
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:52,211
SPOKEN.

2200
01:08:52,294 --> 01:09:01,011
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

2201
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:06,934
WOO AND TONY, CONGRATULATIONS.

2202
01:09:07,017 --> 01:09:08,894
YOU HAVE GONE AS FAR AS YOU CAN

2203
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:10,855
GO IN THIS GAME.

2204
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:12,398
TOMORROW NIGHT, THE POWER IN THE

2205
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:14,358
GAME SHIFTS TO THE JURY.

2206
01:09:14,441 --> 01:09:16,026
NINE PEOPLE THAT YOU HAD A HAND

2207
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:17,987
IN VOTING OUT WILL NOW DECIDE

2208
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:19,780
WHO THEY THINK IS MOST WORTHY OF

2209
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:21,949
THE TITLE OF SOLE SURVIVOR, AND

2210
01:09:22,032 --> 01:09:22,825
THE MILLION DOLLARS THAT GOES

2211
01:09:22,908 --> 01:09:23,450
WITH IT.

2212
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:26,662
YOU HAVE ONE MORE NIGHT.

2213
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:28,581
TRY TO GET SOME SLEEP.

2214
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:29,999
YOU'RE GOINGS TO NEED TO COME

2215
01:09:30,082 --> 01:09:30,666
STRONG TOMORROW.

2216
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:31,584
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

2217
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:32,543
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

2218
01:09:32,626 --> 01:09:34,336
SEE YOU TOMORROW NIGHT FOR YOUR

2219
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:40,801
FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL.

2220
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:42,511
>> WOO.

2221
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:43,345
STUPID, STUPID, STUPID.

2222
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:46,640
I THINK YOU MADE A HORRIFIC

2223
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:47,141
MILLION-DOLLAR DECISION.

2224
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:48,976
I THINK YOU ACTUALLY COULD HAVE

2225
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:49,643
BEATEN ME.

2226
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:51,520
I'M VERY PLEASE WITH THE GAME I

2227
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:51,770
PLAYED.

2228
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:52,980
SOME PEOPLE WILL HATE ME.

2229
01:09:53,063 --> 01:09:54,690
SOME PEOPLE WILL APPRECIATE THAT

2230
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:57,318
I'M A FAN AND I PLAYED HARD.

2231
01:09:57,401 --> 01:09:58,861
AND I PLAYED TO WIN.

2232
01:09:58,944 --> 01:09:59,486
AND IN THE END, I HAD A HELL OF

2233
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,322
A TIME.

2234
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:22,259
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU,

2235
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:25,137
MY MAN.

2236
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:27,556
>> ONE LOVE, MAN.

2237
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:28,849
>> WHAT DID FOR ME TONIGHT IS

2238
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:29,683
MORE THAN I EVER DID FOR YOU, MY

2239
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:29,934
FRIEND.

2240
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:30,309
I APPRECIATE IT.

2241
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:31,769
>> ONE LOVE, BRO.

2242
01:10:31,852 --> 01:10:32,645
>> ONE LOVE IS RIGHT.

2243
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:35,564
>> FINAL TWO!

2244
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:35,773
WHOOO!

2245
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:38,150
PRIOR TO TRIBAL COUNCIL I WAS

2246
01:10:38,233 --> 01:10:39,443
HAVING A REALLY TOUGH TIME.

2247
01:10:39,526 --> 01:10:40,778
IT'S NOT AN EASY DECISION TO

2248
01:10:40,861 --> 01:10:42,237
MAKE, BUT MY DECISION TONIGHT IS

2249
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:44,573
A BIG POWER MOVE THAT I CAN

2250
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:46,742
FINALLY CLAIM AS MY OWN.

2251
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:48,452
SO WHAT REALLY GOT ME TO LEAN

2252
01:10:48,535 --> 01:10:50,371
MORE TOWARDS TAKING TONY WAS

2253
01:10:50,454 --> 01:10:52,414
WHAT I THOUGHT THE JURY WOULD

2254
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:53,624
RESPECT.

2255
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:55,668
>> LIKEABILITY ALONE DOESN'T WIN

2256
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:56,835
YOU THE MILLION, BUT NOW YOU

2257
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:58,629
HAVE THAT RESPECT BEHIND IT.

2258
01:10:58,712 --> 01:10:59,880
WE BOTH HAVE A SHOT, AND THAT'S

2259
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:00,381
ALL WE WANTED.

2260
01:11:00,464 --> 01:11:02,174
>> YEAH, THAT'S IT, MAN.

2261
01:11:02,257 --> 01:11:03,842
WE GOT 50-50, BRO.

2262
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:06,553
I KNOW THAT TAKING TONY COULD

2263
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:07,846
JEOPARDIZE MY CHANCES OF WINNING

2264
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:08,597
A MILLION DOLLARS.

2265
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:09,390
>> WHAT YOU DID TONIGHT, BLOWS

2266
01:11:09,473 --> 01:11:10,474
EVERYTHING AWAY, BECAUSE I'M

2267
01:11:10,557 --> 01:11:12,309
HERE BECAUSE OF YOU NOW.

2268
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:14,311
>> BUT TAKING HIM JUST FELT

2269
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:16,271
RIGHT IN A MARTIAL ARTS

2270
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:18,065
TOURNAMENT, IF I WENT UP AGAINST

2271
01:11:18,148 --> 01:11:18,691
SOMEONE WHO WASN'T AS TALENTED

2272
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:21,694
AS I WAS, THAT VICTORY WOULDN'T

2273
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:22,611
BE AS SWEET.

2274
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:24,363
YOU WANT TO GO UP AGAINST

2275
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:27,408
SOMEONE WHO IS JUST AS STRONG,

2276
01:11:27,491 --> 01:11:28,325
MAYBE EVEN STRONGER, SO IF YOU

2277
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:31,578
DO WIN, IT'S THAT MUCH MORE

2278
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:38,460
HONORABLE.

2279
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:41,338
>> TREE MAIL, TREE MAIL.

2280
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:43,257
>> TREE MAIL.

2281
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:44,341
>> OH!

2282
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:45,467
WOW, MAN.

2283
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:47,136
>> THIS IS THE BEST TREE MAIL

2284
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:48,178
WE'VE GOT SINCE WE'VE BEEN ON

2285
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:48,554
THIS ISLAND.

2286
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:50,097
LET ME LIFT THIS UP.

2287
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:50,347
>> OKAY.

2288
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:53,976
>> YOU TAKE A LOOK INSIDE.

2289
01:11:54,059 --> 01:11:54,393
>> OH!

2290
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:56,353
>> TODAY WE TAKE A WALK TO TREE

2291
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:57,646
MAIL.

2292
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:02,026
OH, MY GOODNESS.

2293
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,361
EGGS, CROISSANTS, SAUSAGES,

2294
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:04,570
BACON.

2295
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:08,657
I REALLY AM LOVING LIFE.

2296
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:10,993
>> MAYBE THAT'S BEEF BACON.

2297
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:13,412
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN I DON'T

2298
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:14,329
KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

2299
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:16,457
>> I JUST HEAR MY WIFE SAY STUFF

2300
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:16,749
LIKE THAT.

2301
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:18,792
>> I'M NOT THE BEST CHEF, I'M

2302
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:19,543
NOT A KITCHEN INN THIEWZ

2303
01:12:19,626 --> 01:12:22,254
YESTERDAY AT ALL AND NEITHER IS

2304
01:12:22,337 --> 01:12:22,421
TONY.

2305
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:24,465
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO COOK

2306
01:12:24,548 --> 01:12:24,757
EGGS.

2307
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,008
>> WE'RE GOING TO GET SICK FOR

2308
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:26,258
REAL, MAN.

2309
01:12:26,341 --> 01:12:27,885
>> WHAT DO WE DO BEST?

2310
01:12:27,968 --> 01:12:33,682
WE EAT.

2311
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:37,353
>> I'M STILL IN "SURVIVOR" MODE.

2312
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:37,978
AS A MATTER OF FACT, THERE WAS A

2313
01:12:38,062 --> 01:12:38,979
CLUE IN THE BASKET.

2314
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:41,315
I SEE THE CLUE, AND I WENT INTO

2315
01:12:41,398 --> 01:12:41,732
MY BASIC INSTINCT.

2316
01:12:41,815 --> 01:12:44,610
WOO IS COOKING UP THE FOOD, AND

2317
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:47,905
AS I AM TALKING TO HIM I GRAB

2318
01:12:47,988 --> 01:12:49,406
THE CLUE AND PUT IT IN MY POCKET

2319
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:50,574
AND I'M LIKE WHAT COULD THIS BE.

2320
01:12:50,657 --> 01:12:53,786
MAYBE IT'S A FREE VOTE.

2321
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:56,205
IT GAVE ME A HINT ABOUT GOING TO

2322
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:57,414
THE BACK OF THE CAMP AND THERE'S

2323
01:12:57,498 --> 01:12:58,582
ANOTHER SURPRISE WAITING FOR ME.

2324
01:12:58,665 --> 01:13:01,168
SO I SAID, LET ME JUST GO SEE

2325
01:13:01,251 --> 01:13:03,879
WHAT THIS IS.

2326
01:13:03,962 --> 01:13:06,381
AND IT WAS A MIRROR WITH A

2327
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:06,632
SCALE.

2328
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:07,758
I HOOKED IN THE MIRROR, AND

2329
01:13:07,841 --> 01:13:10,094
THANK GOD IT DIDN'T CRACK.

2330
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:11,637
WOW!

2331
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:17,935
OH, MY GOODNESS!

2332
01:13:18,018 --> 01:13:18,519
IT SAYS 171.

2333
01:13:18,602 --> 01:13:20,562
NOW I'M 150.

2334
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:21,563
21 POUNDS I LOST OUT HERE.

2335
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,732
THIS IS SICK.

2336
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:24,525
I CAME OUT HERE NOT KNOWING

2337
01:13:24,608 --> 01:13:27,402
ANYTHING ABOUT MAKING FIRES, NOT

2338
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:28,487
KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT CUTTING

2339
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,030
PALM FRONDS.

2340
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:32,366
I NEVER HELD A MASHET NEMY HAND

2341
01:13:32,449 --> 01:13:33,200
IN MY LIFE.

2342
01:13:33,283 --> 01:13:34,701
I JUST USED MY COMMON SENSE.

2343
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:36,036
>> WOO?

2344
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:36,411
>> WHAT?

2345
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:37,496
>> COME HERE, KID.

2346
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:38,789
I FOUND SOMETHING.

2347
01:13:38,872 --> 01:13:41,208
>> THROUGHOUT THIS GAME, TONY

2348
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:41,750
HAD SO MANY NAMES, TONY IN

2349
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:42,626
TROUBLE.

2350
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:42,960
TONE NECHARGE.

2351
01:13:43,043 --> 01:13:44,628
TONE IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT.

2352
01:13:44,711 --> 01:13:46,171
TONE NECONTROL.

2353
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:48,590
TODAY, I FEEL LIKE I'M TONE

2354
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:49,591
NENEED OF A MILLION DOLLARS.

2355
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,760
A MILLION DOLLARS WAS MY MAIN

2356
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:53,011
PRIORITY TO COME OUT HERE.

2357
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:54,596
TO BETTER MY LIFE, BETTER MY

2358
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:55,180
WIFE'S LIFE.

2359
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:57,975
AND ALL MY WIFE WANTS IS A PINK

2360
01:13:58,058 --> 01:13:59,268
CHANDELIER FOR MY BABY DAUGHTER

2361
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:00,769
AND SHE MY BABY DAUGHTER'S GOING

2362
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:02,813
TO HAVE A BEAUTIFUL PINK

2363
01:14:02,896 --> 01:14:03,939
CHANDELIER WHEN I GET BACK HOME.

2364
01:14:04,022 --> 01:14:06,066
>> OH, DAMN!

2365
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:10,946
I LOOK GOOD!

2366
01:14:11,029 --> 01:14:11,155
WHOA!

2367
01:14:11,238 --> 01:14:12,030
>> I DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME--

2368
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:13,365
>> OH, MAN.

2369
01:14:13,448 --> 01:14:14,533
I'M LOOKING FINE, BRO.

2370
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:16,577
LOOK AT MY MUSTACHE!

2371
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:20,205
OH, MY GOSH, BRO.

2372
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:20,706
ONE 62?

2373
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:24,376
NOW I WAY 143.

2374
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,712
I'M HERE, I MADE THE FINAL TWO.

2375
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:27,713
IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE.

2376
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:30,841
OH, MAN, I WANT THIS MORE THAN

2377
01:14:30,924 --> 01:14:31,091
ANYTHING.

2378
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:31,675
I'M GOING TO GO INTO TRIBAL

2379
01:14:31,758 --> 01:14:33,802
COUNCIL, AND I'M GOING TO LET

2380
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:36,221
THE JURY KNOW EXACTLY HOW I FELT

2381
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:37,431
ABOUT THE GAME.

2382
01:14:37,514 --> 01:14:39,183
I'M A MARTIAL ARTS INSTRUCTOR,

2383
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:42,019
AND WE ABIDE BY THE FIVE CODES

2384
01:14:42,102 --> 01:14:45,022
OF TAIWAN DOUGH-- DISCIPLINE,

2385
01:14:45,105 --> 01:14:46,690
INTEGRITY, LOILTD, RESPECT,

2386
01:14:46,773 --> 01:14:48,025
HARMONY BETWEEN MIND AND BODY.

2387
01:14:48,108 --> 01:14:51,236
I DID A VAL YAPT EFFORT ABIDING

2388
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,571
BY THOSE CODES OF CONDUCT

2389
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:55,365
THROUGHOUT THIS GAME, AND NO ONE

2390
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:56,408

2487
01:17:59,424 --> 01:18:00,550
MAJOR HEART TRANSPLANT.

2523
01:19:02,028 --> 01:19:04,448

COOR SHOULD DO?

2528
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:09,786
>> I THINK THE BIGGEST MISTAKE

2529
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:11,371
GOING UP AGAINST A JURY, IF

2530
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:13,123
THEY'RE A HOSTILE JURY OR

2531
01:19:13,206 --> 01:19:13,915
FRIENDLY JURY IS BEING

2532
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:14,166
DEFENSIVE.

2533
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:16,084
YOU HAVE TO LET YOUR GUARD DOWN.

2534
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:17,461
YOU HAVE TO BE VULNERABLE.

2535
01:19:17,544 --> 01:19:19,045
AND YOU HAVE TO BE OPEN AND

2536
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:19,880
REALLY STAND BEHIND THE MOVES

2537
01:19:19,963 --> 01:19:20,213

DOWN ON YOUR BADGE, AND I SWORE

2569
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:22,484

01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:04,711

01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:17,140
I WAS A GOOD PLAYER.

2639
01:22:17,223 --> 01:22:18,058
I WASN'T A VILLAIN.

2640
01:22:18,141 --> 01:22:20,268
I WAS DOING STRATEGIC MOVES TO

2641
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:22,228

GAME ON THE BEAUTY TRIBE, WHICH

2651
01:22:37,994 --> 01:22:40,747
I FOUND PRETTY FITTING TO BEING,

2652
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:42,123
YOU KNOW, A YOUNG AND ATTRACTIVE

2653
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:42,332
WOMAN.

2654
01:22:42,415 --> 01:22:45,001
I KNOW HOW TO KEEP A MAN IN MY

2655
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:45,543
BACKPOCKET, AND I THINK IT'S

2656
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:46,044
SORT OF A SKILL.

01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:49,714

AND YOU DID IT WITHOUT EVEN

2660
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:52,008
HAVING BREASTS.

2661
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:53,134
SO HOW DID YOU DO IT?

01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:30,917
ALLIANCE WHY I DID IT.

2754
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,460
SO NERVE MY ALLIANCE SAW THE

2755
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,336
ONLY TIME I WOULD BREAK MY

2756
01:25:33,419 --> 01:25:34,170
PROMISE TO YOU IS IF YOU BROKE

2757
01:25:34,254 --> 01:25:36,089
IT TO ME FIRST.

2758
01:25:36,172 --> 01:25:37,549
THE ONLY PERSON I BROKE MY

2759
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:39,342
PROMISE TO REGRETFULLY WAS

2760
01:25:39,425 --> 01:25:39,634
TRISH.

2761
01:25:39,717 --> 01:25:40,760
SHE NEVER DID ANYTHING.

2762
01:25:40,844 --> 01:25:42,303
SHE NEVER WENT BEHIND MY BACK TO

2763
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:44,222
BACKSTAB ME.

2764
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:44,806
SHE WOULD HAVE STAYED LOYAL TO

2765
01:25:44,889 --> 01:25:46,140
ME TO THE END.

2766
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:47,809
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE I FEEL DIDN'T

2767
01:25:47,892 --> 01:25:48,935
BREAK HER PROMISE TO ME FIRST.

2768
01:25:49,018 --> 01:25:49,894
I BROKE IT FIRST.

2769
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:50,228
>> THANK YOU.

2770
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:52,230
WOO, CONGRATULATIONS.

2771
01:25:52,313 --> 01:25:54,023
MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS HOW DID

2772
01:25:54,107 --> 01:25:56,568
YOU CHOOSE TO ALIGN WITH TONY

2773
01:25:56,651 --> 01:25:58,778
VERSUS ANYONE ELSE THAT WAS IN

2774
01:25:58,862 --> 01:26:00,488
YOUR ALLIANCE, STRATEGICALLY?

2775
01:26:00,572 --> 01:26:02,407
>> THE MAJORITY OF THIS GAME,

2776
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:04,033
TONY AND I WERE NOT CLOSE.

2777
01:26:04,117 --> 01:26:04,450
HE DIDN'T TRUST ME.

2778
01:26:04,534 --> 01:26:06,786
HE THOUGHT I WAS A WEASEL.

2779
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:07,412
DAY ONE.

2780
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:09,455
IT WASN'T UNTIL THAT SOLANA 5

2781
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:11,374
THAT HE REALLY TRUSTED ME GOING

2782
01:26:11,457 --> 01:26:11,916
INTO THE MERGE.

2783
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,252
I WAS THE ODD MAN OUT OUT OF OUR

2784
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:16,170
NEW SOLANA 5.

2785
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:17,380
I KNEW IF THE NEXT PERSON WERE

2786
01:26:17,463 --> 01:26:19,215
TO GO IN OUR 5 IT WOULD HAVE

2787
01:26:19,299 --> 01:26:20,550
BEEN ME.

2788
01:26:20,633 --> 01:26:22,468
I MANAGED TO ADAPT AND MOLD

2789
01:26:22,552 --> 01:26:23,428
MYSELF, EVEN THOUGH I KNEW I WAS

2790
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:27,515
ODD MAN OUT.

2791
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:30,894
>> OKAY, THANK YOU.

2792
01:26:30,977 --> 01:26:35,690
>> Jeff: THANKS, TASHA.

2793
01:26:35,773 --> 01:26:36,274
L.J.

2794
01:26:36,357 --> 01:26:39,319
>> I CAN SPEAK.

2795
01:26:39,402 --> 01:26:41,446
I NEED TO KNOW WITH YOU, TONY,

2796
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:43,656
LIKE, WHO ARE YOU?

2797
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:45,325
LIKE, DID YOU BRING YOU OR ARE

2798
01:26:45,408 --> 01:26:49,537
YOU JUST LIVING, YOU KNOW, A

2799
01:26:49,621 --> 01:26:50,997
FANTASY WORLD AND PLAYING A

2800
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:51,205
GAME?

2801
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:53,166
>> WELL, IT DEPEND ON WHETHER

2802
01:26:53,249 --> 01:26:55,043
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE GAME.

2803
01:26:55,126 --> 01:26:56,210
AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED,

2804
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:57,295
WILLING, I SEEN, YOU I WAS

2805
01:26:57,378 --> 01:26:58,922
PETRIFIED OF YOU.

2806
01:26:59,005 --> 01:27:00,256
I KNEW HOW STRATEGIC YOU WERE, I

2807
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:03,593
WAS LOOKING FOR THE QUICKEST

2808
01:27:03,676 --> 01:27:04,260
EXCUSE I COULD FIND BECAUSE I

2809
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:08,932
WAS TERRIFIED OF YOU.

2810
01:27:09,015 --> 01:27:09,557
I YOU SAID MAYBE WE NEED TO GET

2811
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:10,892
WOO OUT.

2812
01:27:10,975 --> 01:27:12,393
I WAS LIKE YES, HE WAS WILLING

2813
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:13,436
TO BRECK HAZE PROMISE AND NOW I

2814
01:27:13,519 --> 01:27:13,811
CAN BREAK MINE.

2815
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:16,022
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I

2816
01:27:16,105 --> 01:27:17,190
RESPECT THAT, HOWEVER, YOU

2817
01:27:17,273 --> 01:27:17,482
PLAYED ME.

2818
01:27:17,565 --> 01:27:19,400
>> I HAVE TO LIE L.J. IN THE

2819
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:19,609
GAPE.

2820
01:27:19,692 --> 01:27:20,735
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT.

2821
01:27:20,818 --> 01:27:23,738
>> AND I USED THAT AS AN EXCUSE.

2822
01:27:23,821 --> 01:27:26,032
OH, L.J. WANTED TO VOTE YOU OUT

2823
01:27:26,115 --> 01:27:26,240
FIRST.

2824
01:27:26,324 --> 01:27:26,783
L.J. WAS WILLING TO MAKE A

2825
01:27:26,866 --> 01:27:27,408
PROMISE HE MADE.

2826
01:27:27,492 --> 01:27:29,494
GUESS WHAT?

2827
01:27:29,577 --> 01:27:30,495
LET'S BREAK THE PROMISE TO HIM.

2828
01:27:30,578 --> 01:27:32,163
>> ALL RIGHT, I HAVE NOTHING

2829
01:27:32,246 --> 01:27:38,169
MORE.

2830
01:27:38,252 --> 01:27:42,674
>> Jeff: KASS, YOU'RE UP.

2831
01:27:42,757 --> 01:27:44,884
>> WOO, LAST NIGHT, YOU BECAME

2832
01:27:44,968 --> 01:27:45,176
THE BOSS.

2833
01:27:45,259 --> 01:27:48,388
YOU HAD THE NECKLACE.

2834
01:27:48,471 --> 01:27:50,223
YOU USURPED THE POWER OF TONY

2835
01:27:50,306 --> 01:27:51,933
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

2836
01:27:52,016 --> 01:27:53,518
WHY ON EARTH DID YOU NOT CUT THE

2837
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:56,104
HEAD OF THE DRAGON OFF?

2838
01:27:56,187 --> 01:27:57,438
THE INTEGRITY OF GAME IS TO HAVE

2839
01:27:57,522 --> 01:27:59,232
THE WINNER MAKE THE RIGHT MOVES.

2840
01:27:59,315 --> 01:28:01,067
YOU DIDN'T MAKE A MOVE WHEN YOU

2841
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:02,860
COULD HAVE THAT WOULD HAVE WON

2842
01:28:02,944 --> 01:28:03,486
YOU A MILLION DOLLARS.

2843
01:28:03,569 --> 01:28:05,446
>> YOU KNOW, LAST NIGHT, I HAD A

2844
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:07,365
HUGE RESPONSIBILITY ON MY HAND

2845
01:28:07,448 --> 01:28:10,284
FOR ME AND MY FIELD OF STUDIES,

2846
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:13,246
I'M A MAN WHO IS TRYING TO BE

2847
01:28:13,329 --> 01:28:14,580
HONORABLE, NO MATTER WHAT.

2848
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:15,832
A MILLION DOLLARS MEANS A WHOLE

2849
01:28:15,915 --> 01:28:16,541
BUNCH TO ME.

2850
01:28:16,624 --> 01:28:21,671
BUT I FELT THAT MY PART TO BRING

2851
01:28:21,754 --> 01:28:23,214
ALONG SOMEONE THAT DESERVED TO

2852
01:28:23,297 --> 01:28:24,549
BE HERE WOULD GIVE ME POINT FROM

2853
01:28:24,632 --> 01:28:26,134
THE JURY.

2854
01:28:26,217 --> 01:28:28,094
>> YOU BROUGHT SOMEONE WHO

2855
01:28:28,177 --> 01:28:29,387
DESERVED IT MORE THAN YOU TO GET

2856
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:30,096
POINTS FOR YOURSELF?

2857
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:32,223
>> WE'RE ALL DESERVING, KASS.

2858
01:28:32,306 --> 01:28:34,684
BUT BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU, I

2859
01:28:34,767 --> 01:28:35,893
DIDN'T FEEL LIKE YOU DESERVED TO

2860
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:40,398
SIT HERE NEXT TO ME BUT TONY DID

2861
01:28:40,481 --> 01:28:40,732
DID.

2862
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:42,317
>> OKAY.

2863
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:43,860
I'M GOOD, I THINK.

2864
01:28:43,943 --> 01:28:48,573
>> Jeff: THANKS, KASS.

2865
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:49,532
TRISH.

2866
01:28:49,615 --> 01:28:51,534
>> HI, GUYS.

2867
01:28:51,617 --> 01:28:51,909
CONGRATULATIONS.

2868
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:53,369
WOO, I HAVE JUST ONE QUESTION

2869
01:28:53,453 --> 01:28:55,246
FOR YOU.

2870
01:28:55,329 --> 01:28:57,498
WAS IT YOUR IDEA OR WAS IT

2871
01:28:57,582 --> 01:28:58,708
TONY'S IDEA TO BLINDSIDE ME?

2872
01:28:58,791 --> 01:29:00,209
>> IT WAS MY IDEA.

2873
01:29:00,293 --> 01:29:02,211
>> WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO DO

2874
01:29:02,295 --> 01:29:02,420
THAT?

2875
01:29:02,503 --> 01:29:03,337
YOU HAVE A GREAT REPUTATION WITH

2876
01:29:03,421 --> 01:29:04,839
THE JURY.

2877
01:29:04,922 --> 01:29:05,882
YOU'RE A SWEETHEART.

2878
01:29:05,965 --> 01:29:06,549
I FELT THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE A

2879
01:29:06,632 --> 01:29:09,218
SHOT WITH YOU AT THE FINAL

2880
01:29:09,302 --> 01:29:09,552
THREE.

2881
01:29:09,635 --> 01:29:10,511
>> THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH.

2882
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:11,929
THANK YOU FOR THE COMPLIMENT.

2883
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:14,557
I APPRECIATE THAT.

2884
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,434
TONY, WHEN I FIRST SHOWED UP,

2885
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:18,144
YOU AND I FIRST DAY, BECAME THE

2886
01:29:18,227 --> 01:29:21,147
BEST OF BUDDIES.

2887
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:22,607
AND INSTANT FRIEND.

2888
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:23,399
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

2889
01:29:23,483 --> 01:29:25,818
WE STARTED TO SHARE INTIMATE

2890
01:29:25,902 --> 01:29:26,152
STORIES.

2891
01:29:26,235 --> 01:29:27,445
NOW YOU SIT HERE NOW, AND YOU

2892
01:29:27,528 --> 01:29:28,446
WOULD NOT BE SITTING THERE IF I

2893
01:29:28,529 --> 01:29:31,532
DIDN'T HAVE A BIG PART IN IT.

2894
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:36,037
BECAUSE NOBODY HERE EVER FOR ONE

2895
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:36,537
SECOND TRUSTED YOU.

2896
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:38,664
THEY TRUSTED ME.

2897
01:29:38,748 --> 01:29:40,500
AND I HAD TO CONVINCE THEM ALL

2898
01:29:40,583 --> 01:29:43,586
TO TRUST ME TO TRUST YOU.

2899
01:29:43,669 --> 01:29:45,713
AND I SPENT THE ENTIRE GAME

2900
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:47,965
PUTTING OUT LITTLE FLAMES FOR

2901
01:29:48,049 --> 01:29:48,174
TONY.

2902
01:29:48,257 --> 01:29:48,674
SO YOU COULD SIT THERE.

2903
01:29:48,758 --> 01:29:51,803
AND YOU CAME TO ME IN YOUR

2904
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:52,553
PARANOIA AND YOU SAID, "I'M

2905
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:55,223
TELLING YOU, MAN, I'M TELLING

2906
01:29:55,306 --> 01:29:56,682
YOU, SOMETHING'S GOING WRONG

2907
01:29:56,766 --> 01:29:56,891
HERE.

2908
01:29:56,974 --> 01:29:59,769
OF I SAID, "TONY TAKE A CHILL

2909
01:29:59,852 --> 01:30:00,436
PILL.

2910
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:00,645
RELAX.

2911
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:01,020
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

2912
01:30:01,104 --> 01:30:02,605
I'M NEVER GOING TO LEAVE YOU."

2913
01:30:02,688 --> 01:30:04,482
AND YOU SAID, "I NEED TON THAT

2914
01:30:04,565 --> 01:30:06,109
FOR A FACT."

2915
01:30:06,192 --> 01:30:07,443
I SAID DON'T BE SWEARING ON YOUR

2916
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:08,069
MOTHER AND KID.

2917
01:30:08,152 --> 01:30:11,405
DID YOU THAT FOR EVERYBODY ELSE.

2918
01:30:11,489 --> 01:30:11,948
FIND SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

2919
01:30:12,031 --> 01:30:13,491
AND YOU LOOKED RIGHT AT ME AND

2920
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:15,576
SAID TO ME AND SAID I WILL SWEAR

2921
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:18,704
ON MY FATHER'S GRAVE.

2922
01:30:18,788 --> 01:30:21,374
I'VE LOST TWO SIBLINGS.

2923
01:30:21,457 --> 01:30:23,501
AND THOSE TWO LOSSES HAVE PUT

2924
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:25,461
TWO HOLES IN MY HEART THAT COULD

2925
01:30:25,545 --> 01:30:29,006
NEVER, EVER BE REPAIRED.

2926
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:32,844
I WOULD NEVER, EVER, EVER HAVE

2927
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:35,638
GONE BACK ON THE PROMISE OF MY

2928
01:30:35,721 --> 01:30:35,888
BROTHERS.

2929
01:30:35,972 --> 01:30:38,599
NOT TODAY, NOT TOMORROW.

2930
01:30:38,683 --> 01:30:40,768
NOT FOR 100 MILLION DOLLARS, NOT

2931
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:41,811
FOR ANYTHING.

2932
01:30:41,894 --> 01:30:44,522
I HAVE ONE MILLION-DOLLAR

2933
01:30:44,605 --> 01:30:45,523
QUESTION FOR YOU THAT I WANT YOU

2934
01:30:45,606 --> 01:30:48,651

CAN'T HELP BUT MAKE THIS

2964
01:31:56,677 --> 01:31:59,764
COMPARISON BETWEEN YOUR

01:31:59,847 --> 01:32:01,432
STRATEGIC PLAY AND THE BEHAVIOR

2966
01:32:01,515 --> 01:32:01,682
OF A DOG.

01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:04,894
I MEAN, TONY WAS LIKE YOUR

01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:06,687
WHEN HE SAID, "SIT," YOU SAT.

2970
01:32:06,771 --> 01:32:09,148
WHEN HE SAID THE WORD, YOU WENT

2971

EVEN IN CAMP LIFE, YOU WERE IN

01:32:14,028 --> 01:32:16,280
HIS POCKET 24/7.

2976
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:18,157
WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO YOU HAVING

2977
01:32:18,241 --> 01:32:19,492
AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ONE OF

2978
01:32:19,575 --> 01:32:20,618
THE BIGGEST GOATS IN SURVIVOR

2979
01:32:20,701 --> 01:32:23,329
HISTORY TO THE END, YOU DID WHAT

2980
01:32:23,412 --> 01:32:25,331
A GOOD DOG WOULD DO AND STAYED

2981
01:32:25,414 --> 01:32:25,915

01:32:31,337 --> 01:32:32,129
FOR SOMEONE LIKE YOU WHO HAS

2986
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:32,713
BEEN A STUDENT OF THE GAME,

2987
01:32:32,797 --> 01:32:34,715
SOMEONE WHO APPRECIATES THE

2988
01:32:34,799 --> 01:32:36,759
GAME, CAN YOU RESPECT ME IF I

2989
01:32:36,842 --> 01:32:38,678
TOOK A GOAT LIKE KASS TO THE

2990

01:32:43,099 --> 01:32:44,225
GAME, I WOULD EXPECT YOU TO TAKE

2993
01:32:44,308 --> 01:32:44,850
A GOAT TO THE FINALS.

2994
01:32:44,934 --> 01:32:46,978
>> BUT FOR ME, I'M A DIFFERENT

2995
01:32:47,061 --> 01:32:47,520
STUDENT, I GUESS.

2996
01:32:47,603 --> 01:32:49,188
I WANTED TO TAKE SOMEONE WHO

2997
01:32:49,272 --> 01:32:50,815
DESERVED TO GO.

2998
01:32:50,898 --> 01:32:53,609
>> OKAY, THANKS.

2999
01:32:53,693 --> 01:32:55,611
TONY, I DON'T NEED TO ASK YOU

3000
01:32:55,695 --> 01:32:56,153
ANY QUESTIONS.

3001
01:32:56,237 --> 01:32:59,282
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ALL.

3002
01:32:59,365 --> 01:33:02,076
LOVE HIM OR HATE HIM, TONY

3003
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:03,744
PLAYED HIS ASS OFF OUT HERE.

3004
01:33:03,828 --> 01:33:06,789
WOO TRIES TO EXCUSE HIS PASSIVE

3005
01:33:06,872 --> 01:33:09,709
PLAY ON NOT HAVING IDOLS AND

3006
01:33:09,792 --> 01:33:11,460
TONE FINDING THREE IDOLS.

3007
01:33:11,544 --> 01:33:12,795
WHY DO YOU THINK TONY FOUND

3008
01:33:12,878 --> 01:33:13,087
THREE IDOLS?

3009
01:33:13,170 --> 01:33:15,423
IT'S BECAUSE HE LOOKED MORE THAN

3010
01:33:15,506 --> 01:33:16,549
EVERYONE ELSE COMBINED.

3011
01:33:16,632 --> 01:33:18,467
TONY WAS BEHIND EVERY GREAT

3012
01:33:18,551 --> 01:33:19,302
STRATEGIC DECISION.

3013
01:33:19,385 --> 01:33:20,803
HE BLINDED HIS ALLIANCE TO WHAT

3014
01:33:20,886 --> 01:33:22,638
WAS GOING ON AROUND HIM IN THE

3015
01:33:22,722 --> 01:33:22,847
GAME.

3016
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:24,140
LIKE A PUPPET MASTER.

3017
01:33:24,223 --> 01:33:27,059
HE TOOK A SLEW OF GOATS DEEP.

3018
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:27,727
PUT SOME ON THE JURY.

3019
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:29,812
HE TOOK ONE TO THE END.

3020
01:33:29,895 --> 01:33:33,357
TONY PLAYED WITH A VEROCITY.

3021
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:37,695
