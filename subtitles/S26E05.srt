00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:04,295
"SURVIVOR": FAVORITES HAVE A

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:07,382
HUGE LEAD.

4
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:10,260
DESPITE REYNOLD'S HEROICS

5
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,054
REYNOLD HAS MADE UP A LOT OF

6
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,472
GROUND!

7
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:15,181
THE FANS LOST THEIR THIRD

8
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:18,226
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE IN A ROW.

9
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:19,144
FOR THE FAVORITES, WINNING

10
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:24,107
WASN'T THEIR PROBLEM.

11
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,734
THE MAJORITY ALLIANCE WAS

12
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:26,651
TARGETING ONE OF THEIR OWN.

13
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,778
>> SHE IS IN THE CORE SIX, BUT I

14
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,573
REALLY WANT CORINNE OUT.

15
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:32,115
>> Jeff: AND BRANDON HAD A

16
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,284
SERIES OF EMOTIONAL OUTBURSTS.

17
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,244
>> DON'T BE MEAN, BRANDON.

18
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,204
>> I'M BEING VICIOUS.

19
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,247
I'LL PEE IN THE RICE.

20
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,624
I'LL PEE IN THE BEANS.

21
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,835
I'LL BURN THE SHELTER TO THE

22
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:44,085
GROUND.

23
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:44,669
>> Jeff: THE ENTIRE TRIBE WAS

24
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,963
LEFT WONDERING WHAT HE WOULD DO

25
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,882
NEXT.

26
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,801
AT THE FANS CHAMP, SHAMAR WAS A

27
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,137
CONSTANT SOURCE OF CONFLICT.

28
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,263
>> SHUT UP!

29
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,431
>> Jeff: AND EVEN THREATENED

30
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,140
TO QUIT THE GAME.

31
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,350
>> WE WILL BE DOWN TWO IF YOU

32
00:00:59,434 --> 00:00:59,559
QUIT.

33
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,894
>> Jeff: BUT IT WAS AN EYE

34
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,187
INJURY THAT ULTIMATELY SEALED

35
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,438
HIS FATE.

36
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,272
>> FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I WOULD

37
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:09,110
THRIEK PULL YOU FROM THE GAME.

38
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,446
>> Jeff: LOSING WAS TAKING ITS

39
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,490
TOTAL ON THE MAJORITY ALLIANCE.

40
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,283
>> TONIGHT'S TRIBAL IS

41
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,743
DEFINITELY BASED ON PHYSICAL

42
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,495
STRENGTH OR OUR LOYALTIES AND

43
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:18,828
OUR ALLIANCES.

44
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,163
>> I THINK TONIGHT IS THE

45
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,331
MAKE-OR-BREAK FACTOR FOR THIS

46
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:21,498
TRIBE.

47
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,124
>> Jeff: IF ANYBODY HAS THE

48
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,834
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU

49
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:25,460
WANT TO PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE

50
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,086
THE TIME TO DO SO.

51
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,839
IN THE END, REYNOLD PLAYED IT

52
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:30,048
SAFE.

53
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,633
>> GOTTA DO IT, JEFF.

54
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,176
>> Jeff: AND THE FANS CHOSE TO

55
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,260
KEEP STRENGTH OVER LOYALTY.

56
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:39,098
FIFTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF

FAVORITES."

59
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,310
LAURA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

60
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:42,602
15 ARE LEFT.

61
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:56,866
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.

62
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,910
>> YUP, I HEAR YOU.

63
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,370
I THINK WE MADE THE RIGHT

64
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:00,620
DECISION.

65
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,789
I FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT IT, AND

66
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:03,414
I'M HOPING YOU GUYS ARE FEEL THE

67
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,541
SAME WAY.

68
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,834
>> I FEEL GREAT.

69
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,836
>> I THINK NO HARD FEELINGS TO

70
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:08,044
LAURA.

71
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:08,920
SHE'S THE WEAKEST SWIMMER.

72
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,380
>> NO HARD FEELINGS FOR LAURA AT

73
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:10,547
ALL.

74
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,132
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO WIN

75
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:13,508
CHALLENGES AND--

76
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,426
>> THE GAME GOT SIMPLIFIED.

77
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,887
>> YUP.

78
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,013
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, SHERRI?

79
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:19,597
>> I'M FINE.

80
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,015
>> YOU'RE AWFUL QUIET.

81
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:24,394
>> I'M JUST LISTENING.

82
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,689
WE VOTED OUT LAURA AND IT WAS A

83
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:30,900
REALLY HARD DECISION BECAUSE

84
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:31,568
LAURA-- LAURA IS SPECIAL TO ME.

85
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,529
SHE KIND OF REMINDED ME OF MY

86
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,947
DAUGHTER, I MEAN, A SWEET GIRL.

87
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,407
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO WRITE HER

88
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,324
NAME DOWN, BUT I HAD TO GO WITH

89
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,410
THE TRIBE BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL

90
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,579
GOING TO VOTE FOR HER NO MATTER

91
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,871
WHAT.

92
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,414
>> SO TONIGHT, YOUR IDOL GOT

93
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:44,664
FLUSHED.

94
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,291
>> FINE.

95
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,792
I THINK-- I THINK IT'S A GOOD

96
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,252
THING, HONESTLY, BECAUSE IT WAS

97
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,379
A-- A POINT OF DIVISION.

98
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,380
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.

99
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:53,298
THE IDOL'S GONE.

100
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,382
WE'VE GOT THE SIX OF US.

101
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,175
>> I'M STILL NOT TRUSTING

102
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,302
ANYBODY FULLY BECAUSE TRIBAL ONE

103
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:00,096
AND TRIBAL, TWO I WENT IN WITH

104
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,931
ALL THESE HOPES AND ASPIRATIONS

105
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,892
AND BELIEVING THESE PEOPLE AND I

106
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:04,767
GOT COMPLETELY DUPED.

107
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,185
THIS LAST TRIBAL, I DECIDED

108
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,520
HOURS BEFORE I'M PLAYING THE

109
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:07,729
IDOL.

110
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:08,980
THIS IS MY FREE PASS.

111
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:09,814
I FOUND IT.

112
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:10,565
I EARNED IT.

113
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:11,316
I'M GOING TO SAY EXACTLY WHAT I

114
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:11,524
FEEL.

115
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,234
YOU GUYS ARE WORTHLESS IN

116
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:13,526
CHALLENGES.

117
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,945
YOU NEED ME IF YOU WANT TO WIN.

118
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,364
AND IF YOU DON'T KEEP ME AROUND,

119
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,491
YOU'LL MAYBE GET JUROR ONE OR

120
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,285
JUROR TWO AND IT FELT SO GOOD TO

121
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,453
JUST BE HONEST AND SAY IT, AND

122
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,913
IT WAS LIKE, BINGO!

123
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,039
HERE'S MY IDOL.

124
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,040
I DON'T CARE.

125
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,041
THAT WAS WORTH IT.

126
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:28,625
I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK I WAS

127
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,045
TAKING JABS AT YOU GUYS AND YOUR

128
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:32,629
AEXPLIENS MORE THAN YOU GUYS

129
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,048
TOOK JABS AT US AND OUR ALLIANCE

130
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:35,423
EARLY ON.

131
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,050
THAT'S THE GAME.

132
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,885
IST US TO JUST MOVE FORWARD

133
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:39,135
TOGETHER.

134
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:41,137
>> YOU KNOW, REYNOLD PLAYED HIS

135
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,473
IDOL AND HE KNEW, THERE'S, LIKE,

136
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,974
FIVE PEOPLE AGAINST EDDIE AND

137
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:45,266
REYNOLD.

138
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,476
SO, OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, HE'S

139
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,228
LIKE, "I'M GOING TO PLAY THE

140
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:49,437
IDOL."

141
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,271
NOW IT'S JUST KIND OF OUT HERE

142
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,148
ON THE ISLAND SOMEWHERE FOR

143
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:52,899
SOMEONE ELSE TO FIND.

144
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:56,110
>> WHOEVER WAKES UP FIRST IS

145
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,028
MAKING A FIRE.

146
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:01,115
>> IF I'M NOT WEAK, WILL YOU

147
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:01,783
WAKE ME UP.

148
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,076
>> ALL YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS

149
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,035
LOOK FOR THE IDOL AGAIN.

150
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,662
>> I STILL DON'T WANT REYNOLD TO

151
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,914
HAVE THE IDOL BECAUSE HE'S A

152
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:08,581
DANGEROUS PLAYER.

153
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,750
HE'S REALLY-- HE'S A CLUTCH GUY.

154
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,752
HE'S BEEN OUR CLUTCH MAN IN ALL

155
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:13,878
THE CHALLENGES.

156
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,296
HE'S CLUTCH WITH GETTING THE

157
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,297
FIRE STARTED.

158
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,382
HE CAN PULL THROUGH.

159
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,883
SO THAT'S WHY I DON'T WANT HIM

160
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,218
NEAR THE IDOL.

161
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,803
I DON'T WANT HIM PULLING THROUGH

162
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,471
AND FIGURING THIS THING OUT AND

163
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:26,474
GETTING HIMSELF TOO FAR AT MY

164
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:26,766
EXPENSE.

165
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,511
>> THE MOST REAL PEOPLE IN THE

166
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:04,846
WORLD HAVE REALLY, REALLY,

167
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,389
STRONG FEELING FEELINGS

168
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,348
EMOTIONS AND HAVE PASSION.

169
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,351
AND I HAVE SUCH A PASSION FOR MY

170
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,812
FAMILY.

171
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,397
I'D GIVE MY LIFE 1,000 TIMES IN

172
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,983
THE MOST HORRIFIC WAY JUST TO

173
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:17,567
SEE MY WIFE AND MY KIDS.

174
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,986
I STARTED THINKING ABOUT MY

175
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:20,611
FAMILY, MY WIFE AND MY KIDS AND

176
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,656
HOW MUCH THEY NEEDED ME AT HOME.

177
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,575
AND JUST LEAVING THEM AT THE

178
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,036
TROCH A HAT JUST TO PLAY A GAME.

179
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,496
I FELT LIKE I WAS BEING

180
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,581
COMPLETELY SELFISH, COMPLETELY

181
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:31,831
SELFISH.

182
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,542
I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR NOT ONLY MY

183
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,713
LIFE, BUT MY TWO BABIES, MY TWO

184
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:39,505
PRECIOUS BABIES THAT DON'T KNOW

185
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:39,881
WHAT'S GOING ON.

186
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:43,342
THEY JUST THINK, HEY, DADDY'S GP

187
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:43,551
AGAIN.

188
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,095
I CAN'T DO THAT ANYMORE.

189
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,138
ENOUGH'S ENOUGH.

190
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,514
I'VE BEEN MISERABLE.

191
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:52,894
EVERY DAY IS A WASTE.

192
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,604
SO... NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL IF WE

193
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,148
HAVE TO GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL,

194
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,567
I'M VOLUNTEERING FOR YOU TO VOTE

195
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,695
ME OUT OF THE GAME.

196
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,489
>> BRANDON BASICALLY TOLD US HE

197
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,949
WANTS TO GET OUT OF THIS GAME.

198
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,326
IMMEDIATELY MY MIND STARTS

199
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,078
REELING FROM THE IMPLICATIONS.

200
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,579
NOW MY TRIBE IS GOING TO LOSE A

201
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:11,954
MEMBER ON FORCE.

202
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,457
THIS HAS REPERCUSSIONS OUTSIDE

203
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,875
THE HANTZ FAMILY.

204
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,502
AND AS MUCH AS I DON'T WANT THAT

205
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,295
TO WEIGH ON HIS DECISION, MAYBE

206
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,421
HE SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT

207
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,881
BEFORE HE DECIDED TO JUMP OUT

208
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:22,632
HERE WITH THE REST OF US.

209
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,466
>> IT REALLY HURTS MY PRIDE TO

210
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,468
HAVE TO, YOU KNOW, ADMIT ALL

211
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,594
THESE STUPID THINGS BUT I WAS

212
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,805
ABOUT TO LIGHT THE WHOLE THING

213
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:29,472
ON FIRE.

214
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,557
>> I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T DO THAT.

215
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,643
WAY TO CHOOSE THE OTHER OPTION.

216
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,103
>> I WAS GOING TO PEE IN THE

217
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:35,478
BEANS AND RICE.

218
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,064
>> OKAY, I'M GLAD--

219
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,857
>> WE GNARLY ESCAPED THAT.

220
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:40,650
>> IT WAS A PETTY WAY OUT.

221
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,236
BUT, HEY, THOSE THINGS CROSSED

222
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:43,903
MY MIND.

223
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:44,195
MY APOLOGYS.

224
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:45,988
I'M SORRY FOR THE THOUGHT, I

225
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:46,322
AM--

226
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:46,906
>> IT'S OKAY.

227
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:47,573
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

228
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:47,990
SO WE'RE ALL GOOD.

229
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:48,908
>> YEAH.

230
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,868
>> IT TURNS OUT BRANDON'S

231
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:51,911
ALTERNATIVE TO TELLING US HE WAS

232
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,621
GOING TO QUIT WAS HE GOING TO

233
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:54,497
BURN THE SHELTER DOWN AND/OR PEE

234
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,541
IN OUR BEANS AND RICE.

235
00:06:56,624 --> 00:07:00,837
I WANT HIM OFF MY CAMP

236
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,170
IMMEDIATELY.

237
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,339
HE'S LOCO, FOR SURE.

238
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:03,923
CLEARLY, HE'S SPINNING OUT OF

239
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:04,173
CONTROL.

240
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,675
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME.

241
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:06,467
AND IT'S A MATTER OF, LIKE, WHAT

242
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,553
DOES THAT MEAN FOR EVERYONE

243
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,889
AROUND HIM?

244
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:17,061
LIKE, WHAT'S HE GOING TO DO?

245
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,569
>> MY MOTIVATION TO COME OUT

246
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,864
HERE WAS MORE FOR SELFISH REASON

247
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:28,489
THANSZ MOTIVATED TO COME OUT

248
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,450
HERE FOR MY FAMILY.

249
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,995
BUT RATHER THAN LEAVE, I WANT TO

250
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,204
STAY HERE.

251
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,914
MY WHOLE PERSPECTIVE OF THE GAME

252
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:37,665
HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED.

253
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:38,749
I'M OUT HERE FOR THEM.

254
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:39,709

00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:39,876

00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,044
I'M GOING TO DO THIS FOR THEM.

257
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,546
I HAD SOME TIME TO THINK AND

258
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,589
INSTEAD OF LEAVING, I'M GOING TO

259
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,424
GO OUT THERE AND I'M GOING TO

260
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:46,632

MALCOLM SCORES AGAIN.

383
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:31,190
BRENDA IS ON FIRE.

384
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,274
>> BRING IT?

385
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,443

PHILLIP--

389
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,241

390
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,660
>> PHILLIP, WE GOT YOU BABY.

391
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:43,744

00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,621
PUMMEL MATT.

393
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,665
MATT IS HANGING IN THERE, BUT IT

394
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:48,541
IS TOUGH.

398
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:53,838
HOW MUCH LODGER CAN HE HANG ON?

399
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:54,213
THE NOT AT ALL.

400
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,923
MATT IS OUT.

401
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,008

MALCOLM WITH ANOTHER SHOT.

410
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,853
IT IS BACK AND FORTH.

411
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,688
>> PHILLIP, THIS IS NOTHING,

412
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,523

COME GET YOUR REWAR.

435
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,464
FANS, DESPITE ANOTHER GOOD

436
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,840
EFFORT, GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.

437
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:20,216
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

438
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:24,970
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

439
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:51,956
DEFINITELY TODAY I THOUGHT WAS

440
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,083
GOING TO BE A TURNAROUND FOR US.

441
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,001
I THOUGHT TODAY'S CHALLENGE WAS

442
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,212
MOST DEFINITELY OUR CHANCE TO

443
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,797
WIN, OUR CHANCE TO TURN IT

444
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,422
AROUND, GET THE TRIBE GOING IN

445
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,092
THE RIGHT DIRECTION, AND WE BLEW

446
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:03,259
IT.

447
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,677
WE NEED TO TRY SOMETHING NEW.

448
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,721
>> WE NEED TO TRY SOMETHING NEW.

449
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,055
>> YEAH.

450
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,682
>> WE NEED TO TRY SOMETHING NEW

451
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:10,432
AROUND THIS CAMP.

452
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,434
WE NEED TO TRY SOMETHING NEW AT

453
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:12,768
THE CHALLENGES.

454
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:15,396
>> IT IS SO HARD TO KEEP MY

455
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:15,980
MOUTH SHUT RIGHT NOW.

456
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,690
I WENT WITH YOUR PLAN AND I GOT

457
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:18,732
RID OF LAURA.

458
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,569
WE STILL LOST TODAY.

459
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,903
MUSCLE'S NOT PAYING OFF.

460
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,029
AND I JUST HOPE THE ALLIANCE

461
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,073
REALIZES THIS AND DOESN'T LISTEN

462
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,075
TO ALL THEIR CRAP ABOUT HOW WE

463
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,118
NEED MUSCLE.

464
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:29,451
WE NEED MUSCLE.

465
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,661
WE NEED MUSCLE.

466
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:31,120
BUT WHO BEES?

467
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,789
NOW THE FEAR IS THE IDOL IS BACK

468
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:35,833
IN PLAY.

469
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:36,417
IT'S AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

470
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:43,632
I'VE GOT TO FIND IT.

471
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:07,406
♪ ♪ ♪

472
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,950
>> I DEFINITELY DON'T THINK IT'S

473
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,118
A BIG SECRET THAT EVERYONE'S

474
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,953
LOOKING FOR THE IDOL.

475
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,788
I MEAN, IT WAS FLUSHED OUT LAST

476
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:14,997
NIGHT.

477
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,624
I KNOW IT'S BACK ON THIS ISLAND

478
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:16,874
SOMEWHERE.

479
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,250
IT CAN'T BE THAT HARD TO FIND

480
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,461
BECAUSE REYNOLD FOUND IT PRETTY

481
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:20,753
QUICK.

482
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,046
USUALLY THE IDOL IS IN A TREE OR

483
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:27,509
UNDER A ROCK OR SOMETHING.

484
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:27,676
OH!

485
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,719
THAT SO LOOKED LIKE IT!

486
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,721
>> I DEFINITELY WANT TO FIND THE

487
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,765
IDOL, AND IF I FIND THE IDOL,

488
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,183
I'M NOT TELLING ANYBODY IN THIS

489
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:34,350
TRIBE.

490
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,101
>> I'M TOTALLY FOLLOWING MY

491
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:36,977
INSTINCTS OF WHERE THE IDOL

492
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:37,603
COULD BE.

493
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,271
I MEAN, USUALLY IT'S BY

494
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,939
SOMETHING UNIQUE OR, LIKE, A

495
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,149
WEIRD TREE OR A WEIRD ROCK IS

496
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,150
OUT OF PLACE, JUST SOMETHING

497
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,361
THAT KIND OF STANDS OUT.

498
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,321
>> THINGS ARE JUST SO CRAZY, YOU

499
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,864
NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO

500
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:49,073
HAPPEN.

501
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,532
WE'RE DOWN IN NUMBERS, AND

502
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,034
PEOPLE ARE FIDGETY, AND I WANT

503
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,160
TO KNOW WHERE IT IS.

504
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,078
AND IF IT'S?

505
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,789
MY POCKET, IT'S SO IMPORTANT.

506
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,248
IT CAN TAKE ME SO MUCH FURTHER

507
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,793
IF I CAN FIND IT, AND AS LONG AS

508
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:01,710
REYNOLD DOESN'T FIND IT.

509
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,962
I DON'T WANT HIM TO FIND IT.

510
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,005
>> TWICE!

511
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:05,214
TWICE!

512
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,092
NUMBER TWO!

513
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:14,431
OH, MY GOD!

514
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,849
"CONGRATULATIONS, YOU FOUND

515
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,186
FOUND THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL."

516
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,397
I KNOW ALL THIS BY HEART.

517
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,731
IT'S THE SECOND ONE I FOUND.

518
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,483
I MEAN, I MIGHT AS WELL JUST

519
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,360
KEEP PLAYING THEM IF I CAN JUST

520
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,236
KEEP FINDING THEM.

521
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,363
BUT I DON'T WANT THE MAJORITY

522
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,155
ALLIANCE TO KNOW I HAVE THE IDOL

523
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,408
BECAUSE WHEN THEY FOUND OUT I

524
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,826
HAD IT LAST TIME THEY STARTED

525
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:34,451
GUNNING FOR ME IN ORDER TO FLUSH

526
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,828
IT OUT.

527
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,079
I DON'T WANT IT TO GET FLUSHED.

528
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,414
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE IT FOR

529
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,082
A TIME WHEN IT WILL REALLY MAKE

530
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,792
A BIG DIFFERENCE, AND I THINK

531
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:42,376
THERE'S A DIRECT CORRELATION

532
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,962
BETWEEN OPENING YOUR BIG, FAT

533
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,714
MOUTH AND THE IDOL HAVING TO GET

534
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:46,922
PLAYED.

535
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:48,507
MOUTH SHURKT BUT EDDIE'S MY BOY

536
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,551
TO THE END.

537
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,802
I'LL PROBABLY TELL EDDIE.

538
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,012
BACK IN BUSINESS, BABY.

539
00:16:54,096 --> 00:17:05,941
THIS IS HOW YOU PLAY "SURVIVOR."

540
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:06,108
EDDIE.

541
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,234
YOU AND ME TAKING THIS THING TO

542
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:10,028
THE END?

543
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,364
>> HOPING.

544
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,242
>> I GOT IT.

545
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:15,576
>> YOU GOT IT?

546
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,994
>> I GOT IT.

547
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:17,578
>> REALLY?

548
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,664
>> REALLY.

549
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,041
>> IT'S IN MY BAG.

550
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,461
>> THAT'S AWESOME, DUDE.

551
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,963
>> SO WE GOT ONE MORE INSURANCE

552
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:28,172
POLICY.

553
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:28,464
>> YEAH.

554
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,007
>> AND YOU ME, DUDE.

555
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:30,632
ALL THE WAY.

556
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,301
>> ALL THE WAY.

557
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,302
>> I MEAN, YOU CAN'T GET ANY

558
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,012
LUCKIER THAN THAT.

559
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:35,304
YOU CAN'T.

560
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,639
YOU GET RID OF IT AND SIX HOURS

561
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,641
LATER YOU HAVE IT AGAIN.

562
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,142
THAT'S AWESOME.

563
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,268
THE FUNNIEST PART OF THE WHOLE

564
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:44,354
THING SHERRI'S WANTED THIS IDOL

565
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,315
SINCE DAY ONE, AND EVEN TODAY

566
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,191
SHERRI IS WALKING AROUND COMBING

567
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,233
THE BEACH EVERYWHERE, COMBING

568
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,903
THE WOODS, LOOKING FOR THIS

569
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,322
IDOL, AND IT'S JUST FUNNY TO

570
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,658
WATCH.

571
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,993
>> WHOA!

572
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:58,952
HOLY STEAK!

573
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,662
THOSE ARE THICK STEAKS.

574
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:04,583
>>> BRANDON, THANK YOU FOR DOING

575
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:04,792
THAT.

576
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,293
>> BRANDON SEEMED SULLEN.

577
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,669
THERE'S SOMETHING IN HIS EYES.

578
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,838
YOU CAN TELL HE'S GOING BACK AND

579
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:10,798
FORTH IN HIS OWN MIND.

580
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,341
I HOPE THIS WIN BROUGHT HIS

581
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,342
SPIRITS UP, BUT WE'VE BEEN ON A

582
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,344
WINNING STREAK SO I DON'T EVEN

583
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,888
KNOW IF HE WON THE MILLION

584
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,807
DOLLARS IF HE WOULD EVER GET

585
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,516
RIGHT IN HIS HEAD.

586
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,643
>> YOU GUYS WERE SO STRONG.

587
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,436
EVERYBODY-- I MEAN, EVERY

588
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:24,686
PERSON.

589
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,355
>> BRANDON, YOU WERE A ROCK.

590
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,314
THAT'S THE REASON IT WORKED.

591
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,357
>> YOU WERE THE MAN THERE AT THE

592
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:28,524
END.

593
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,150
>> I HAD STRATEGY, TOO.

594
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,402
I KEPT YELLING AT THEM.

595
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,278
WHEN I PLAYED BASKETBALL--

596
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,947
>> I WAS TRYING SO HARD NOT TO

597
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,240
MAKE THIS GAME ABOUT ME ANYMORE,

598
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,284
AND HE ALL OF A SUDDEN DECIDES

599
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,371
TO TAKE OWNERSHIP OF WINNING THE

600
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,330
CHALLENGE BY HIMSELF.

601
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:46,500
PHILLIP SHEPPARD, THIS

602
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,459
DUMB-ASS SPIKE, AGENT-- WHATEVER

603
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,627
YOU YOU WANT TO CALL HIM--

604
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,920
THINKS HE WON THE CHALLENGE AND

605
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,506
IT REALLY, REALLY, REALLY PISSES

606
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,843
ME OFF I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT

607
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:56,051
CRAP.

608
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:57,511
RIGHT NOW I'M A LITTLE BIT

609
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:58,387
AGGRAVATED AND I FEEL LIKE

610
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,847
VENTING A LITTLE BIT.

611
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,306
>> PHIL ARE, WE TAKING THIS

612
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:01,515
DOWN?

613
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,350
>> NO I WANT TO SAVE MY ENERGY

614
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,561
FOR THE CHALLENGES.

615
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,229
I WANT TO KEEP WINNING

616
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:07,521
CHALLENGES.

617
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,106
I DON'T WANT TO DECONSTRUCT THIS

618
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:09,940
YET AGAIN.

619
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,650
HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO DO

620
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:11,984
THIS?

621
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:12,484
>> SHE WAS JUST MAKING A

622
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:12,901
SUGGESTION, PHILLIP.

623
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,779
>> I KNOW, AND I'M GIVING MY

624
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,447
INPUT AS WELL.

625
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,825
>> BE HONEST, PHILLIP, YOUR

626
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,910
INPUT IS MORE, YOU KNOW,

627
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,954
DICTATORSHIP KIND OF ATTITUDE.

628
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,665
I DON'T THINK THAT'S NICE.

629
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,792
>> I JUST SAID I THINK WE SHOULD

630
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:29,084
LEAVE IT.

631
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,128
>> YOU SAY A LOT EVERY TIME

632
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,297
SOMEBODY SAYS SOMETHING.

633
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,133
>> BUT I WILL ARGUE WITH YOU,

634
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:36,383
PHILLIP.

635
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,259
>> THEN ARGUE.

636
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,219
BUT IT WILL BE A ONE-SIDED

637
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:39,553
CONVERSATION.

638
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,305
>> HOW ABOUT YOU SHUT THE

639
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,222
( BLEEP ) UP AND LET SOMEBODY

640
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,348
ELSE HAVE AN OPINION.

641
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,142
>> I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE

642
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:45,767
BRANDON IS DEFINITELY UNSTABLE

643
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,268
AND UNPREDICTABLE.

644
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,604
WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO WITH

645
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:48,896
THAT?

646
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,480
IT'S JUST-- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO

647
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,899
DO WITH IT.

648
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,860
>> BRANDON FINALLY SNAPPED.

649
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:55,861
PHILLIP DIDN'T DO ANYTHING OUT

650
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,821
OF THE ORDINARY, BUT HE CAUGHT

651
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,406
BRANDON IN ONE WERE HIS DOWNWARD

652
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:02,159
SWINGS, AND FOR ME, NO MATTER

653
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,660
WHAT STRATEGIC CONSIDERATION

654
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,245
BRANDON PLAYS, AT SOME POINT,

655
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,457
HE'S GOING TO GO PAST THRESHOLD,

656
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,709
WHERE HE'S MORE OF A DRAIN ON

657
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,002
THE CAMP THAN HE'S GOING TO BE

658
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,003
USEFUL DOWN THE ROAD.

659
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,797
>> YOU ALL THINK I SHOULD GO

660
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,173
APOLOGIZE TO HIM?

661
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,925
>> I'D WAIT A DAY OR TWO.

662
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,217
>> YEAH, I DON'T THINK HE'S

663
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:19,927
GOING TO TOUCH IT NOW.

664
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,720
>> I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE SOME

665
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,555
YOUNG PUNK TELLING ME TO SHUT

666
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:23,722
UP.

667
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:24,723
HE JUST DIDN'T KNOW.

668
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:25,641
I'M A STREET FIGHTER.

669
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,017
I DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN

670
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,268
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

671
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,062
I'M TRYING EVERYTHING I CAN TO

672
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,563
AVOID THAT, BUT IF HE EVER CAME

673
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,065
AT ME, HE'S GOING TO SEE A

674
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,232
DIFFERENT SIDE OF ME.

675
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:34,816
I THINK HE'S UNSTABLE AND I

676
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,526
THINK HE SHOULD BE OUT OF THE

677
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:36,735
GAME.

678
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:37,444
IF THEY WANT TO KEEP HIM IN THE

679
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:38,278
GAME, THEY CAN KEEP HIM IN THE

680
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,198
GAME BUT I WILL PLAY A DIFFERENT

681
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:41,406
GAME.

682
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,074
>> LET'S TALK.

683
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,325
>> NO, I WANT TO SAY THIS TO

684
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,369
YOU, MY DILEMMA, WITH ME, THE

685
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,579
WAY I TRIED TO PLAY IT RIGHT

686
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,330
NOW, I TOLD YOU, YOU WERE GOING

687
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,415
TO GET ABOVE WHERE YOU FINISHED

688
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,125
LAST TIME.

689
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,710
YOU DON'T SLAPT GIFT HORSE.

690
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,461
>> IN OTHER WORDS YOU DON'T BITE

691
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,838
THE HAND THAT FEEDSES--

692
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,215
>> EXACTLY.

693
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,092
I'M TELLING EVERYBODY, NO, NO,

694
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:00,592
HE DESERVES TO BE HERE.

695
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,219
>> WHAT GIVES YOU THE LEADERSHIP

696
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,471
TO SAY, "HEY, HE DESERVES TO BE

697
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:04,680
HERE."

698
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,306
DON'T I MAKE THAT DECISION FOR

699
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,350
MYSELF?

700
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,810
>> YOU MISSED A CLOSE CALL.

701
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,436
>> SO I CAN STILL TRUST YOU.

702
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,312
>> YES, YOU CAN TRUST ME.

703
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,022
I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU THAT.

704
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,818
>> I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ANNOYED WITH

705
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:18,026
PHILLIP.

706
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:18,944
I'VE LISTENED TO HIM.

707
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:19,569
I'VE KISSED HIS BUTT, BUT AT THE

708
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,947
SAME TIME I HAVE TO KEEP MYSELF

709
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:22,447
UNDER CONTROL.

710
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,199
AND AS LONG AS I CAN KEEP MYSELF

711
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,910
UNDER CONTROL, I'LL BE GOOD.

712
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,495
BUT BY DAMN, THAT MIGHT BE A

713
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,372
REALLY TOUGH THING TO DO.

714
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:30,831
I APOLOGIZE AS A MAN.

715
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,791
>> HEY, MAN, I'M SORRY.

716
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:33,500
I HOPE WE'RE OKAY.

717
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,128
AM I STILL-- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

718
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,422
IN MY BOOK YOU'RE PERSONA

719
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:38,714
NONGRATTA.

720
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:39,047
>> ALL RIGHT.

721
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:39,548
LET'S GO PLAY THE GAME.

722
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,465
THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY I HAVE TO

723
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,634
GET HIM OUT OF THE GAME HE WILL

724
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:42,801
GO.

725
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,428
I'M NOT GOING TO PUT UP WITH IT

726
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,512
ANYMORE.

727
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,457
THAT WHEN THE SUN DOES APPEAR,

728
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,709
EVERYTHING IS READY TO DRY.

729
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,627
>> WELL, I DON'T WANT TO DO

730
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:18,003
ANYTHING.

731
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,421
MY FEET ARE JUST JACKED.

732
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,589
>> I'VE BEEN WET FOR, LIKE, TWO

733
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,340
DAYS STRAIGHT.

734
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,759
AND MY FEET JUST LOOK LIKE A

735
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:24,384
DEAD PERSON'S FEET.

736
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,553
I CAN BARELY MOVE MY TOES, AND

737
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:29,723
IT FEELS LIKE I'M ON NAILS

738
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:30,474
>> WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET OUT OF

739
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,517
THIS SITUATION BY SITTING IN THE

740
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,435
HUT, YOU KNOW.

741
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:33,810
THAT'S MY THOUGHT.

742
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:37,439
>> CAMP LIFE AT GOTA HAS BEEN A

743
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,149
LONG STRAND OF HELL.

744
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,526
WE'RE FAILING ON ALL LEVELS OF

745
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,237
SURVIVOR, BUT WE HAVE TO DO

746
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:44,488
SOMETHING.

747
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,532

CHANCE?

00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:22,984
>> OKAY.

765
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,278

HE'S NOT SANE.

00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,501
HE'S NOT RIGHT.

809
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,295
HE COULD HARM ONE OF UTS AND,

BUT IN THIS INSTANCE, THE GOOD

817
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:22,646
OUTWEIGHS THE BAD.

818
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:27,234
IT IS A DEGREE OF COMPASSION FOR

819
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:27,776
HIM, AS WELL AS IT IS

820
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,653
POTENTIALLY A GAME SAVER FOR US

821
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:32,072
BY ELIMINATING HIM OUT OF THE

822
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,658

I CAN'T SEEM TO HAVE A PRIVATE

CONVERSATION WITH ANYBODY.

840
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:06,147

FAR.

856
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,796

>> HEY.

936
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,893
JUST GIVE YOURSELF SOME TIME TO

937
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:49,144
BREATHE.

938
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,937
>> HE'S NOT GOING TO DISRESPECT

939
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:51,229
ME ANYMORE.

940
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:55,400
>> GIVE YOURSELF SOME TIME TO

941
00:28:55,483 --> 00:29:05,910
BREATHE.

942
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,873
>> I'M THE AUTHOR OF MY FATE,

943
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:10,081
BUDDY!

944
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,460
I'M THE AUTHOR OF MY FATE!

945
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:18,131
NOW VOTE ME OUT, BITCH!

946
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,757
>> WHY WASN'T ONE EFFECTIVE

947
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:20,008
ENOUGH?

948
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,009
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE HE DID THAT.

949
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,053
>> WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

950
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,013
( CRYING )

951
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,890
>> BRANDON IS READY TO FIST

952
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:27,640
FIGHT.

953
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,018
HE'S LITERALLY OUT OF HIS MIND.

954
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,604
>> WHY DON'T WE JUST NOT GO TO

955
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:32,937
THE CHALLENGE?

956
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:33,480
>> I THINK IN THIS CASE--

957
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:33,980
>> LET'S GO TO TRIBAL.

958
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,940
>> THERE'S SO MUCH TO CONSIDER

959
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,484
WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT

960
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:37,692
HAPPENS.

961
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:38,985
WE'RE TRYING TO DECIDE IS HE IN

962
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,528
A PLACE AT ALL WHERE WE CAN

963
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,781
STILL PLAY WITH HIM, FORFIT THE

964
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,617
CHALLENGE, GIVE IMMUNITY AWAY,

965
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,703
WHICH YOU NEVER DO IN THIS GAME.

966
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:17,524
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

967
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,150
REYNOLD, YOU HAD A LONG, WET,

968
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,277
RAINY NIGHT LAST NIGHT.

969
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,904
WHAT'S THE IMPACT ON THE TRIBE?

970
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,156
>> WELL, I MEAN, I GUESS IT'S A

971
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,200
TESTAMENT TO HOW HARD THIS GAME

972
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:27,450
REALLY IS.

973
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,910
LIKE, FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW,

974
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,912
YOU GUYS ARE WINNING THE

975
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:31,120
REWARDS.

976
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,540
YOU GUYS HAVE THIS PLUSH SHELTER

977
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,291
WITH THE TARP AND YOUR ROCKING

978
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:35,875
CHAIRS AND PILLOWS AND STEAK

979
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:39,671
DINNERS AND YOU'RE DRINKING YOUR

980
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,673
BOTTLES OF WINE AND HAVING A

981
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:42,966
GOOD OLD TIME, AND WHAT IT BOILS

982
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,801
DOWN TO IS THIS GAME IS

983
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,386
EXTREMELY HARD EVEN IF YOU WIN

984
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:46,970
EVERY SINGLE CHALLENGE.

985
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,222
NOBODY IS IMMUNE FROM THE

986
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:49,472
ELEMENTS.

987
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,599
IN A SENSE, WE'RE ALL IN THIS

988
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:51,849
TOGETHER.

989
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,142
>> Jeff: COCHRAN, WHAT HAPPENS

990
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,769
WHEN FATIGUE SETS IN TO THE MOOD

991
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:55,478
AND THE MORAL.

992
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,063
>> IT DAMAGES MORAL.

993
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,106
YOU FEEL TIRED.

994
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,774
YOU FEEL WORSE.

995
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:00,275
YOU GET A LITTLE GRUMPY.

996
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:00,858
IT RUBS OFF ON OTHER PEOPLE.

997
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,360
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR ANYBODY.

998
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,695
>> Jeff: BRANDON, HOW ARE YOU

999
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:04,362
DOING?

1000
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,030
>> NOT DOING TOO WELL, JEFF.

1001
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,448
HAD A LITTLE OUTBURST THIS

1002
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,074
MORNING WITH PHILLIP, ACTUALLY.

1003
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:11,828
AND I KIND OF WANTED TO TALK TO

1004
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,037
THE OTHER TRIBE.

1005
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:16,165
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

1006
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:16,874
>> Jeff: YEAH.

1007
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,918
>> LET ME STEP OFF MY MAT.

1008
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:19,127
>> GUYS.

1009
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,087
TONIGHT IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE

1010
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:21,546
BIT DIFFERENT.

1011
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,006
YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO HAVE AN

1012
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:23,923
OPPORTUNITY TO COME BACK AND

1013
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,008
MAKE THIS A GAME.

1014
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,801
SO YOU GET A SECOND CHANCE, AND

1015
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:28,011
I'M YOUR SECOND CHANCE.

1016
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,429
SO PHILLIP, PLEASE DON'T LET

1017
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,556
THIS GUY GET TO THE END OF THE

1018
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:31,764
GAME.

1019
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:32,849
PLEASE DON'T LET HIM GET TO THE

1020
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:33,224
END OF THE GAME.

1021
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:36,936
>> WHAT OF WHERE-- WHERE ARE YOU

1022
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,145
GOING?

1023
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,814
>> JEFF, I'D LIKE TO SAY

1024
00:31:39,897 --> 00:31:40,315
SOMETHING ON BEHALF OF THE

1025
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,941
FAVORITES IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

1026
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,067
WE REALIZE THAT THIS IS GOING TO

1027
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,611
BE A CHALLENGE FOR IMMUNITY, AND

1028
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:45,737
IT'S FOR THAT REASON THAT WE'RE

1029
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:51,075
GOING T TO FORFEIT THE CHALLENGE

1030
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,328
THAT WE MAY GO TO TRIBAL.

1031
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,079
WHILE WE'RE ALL FIERCE

1032
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,247
COMPETITORS, WE HAVE DISCOURSE

1033
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,165
IN OUR CAMP AND WOULD LIKE TO

1034
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,876
HASH THAT OUT IN THE APPROPRIATE

1035
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:00,126
SETTING.

1036
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,377
WE RESPECT THIS GAME AND WE HOPE

1037
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,338
YOU AND THE FANS CAN RESPECT OUR

1038
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,047
DECISION TO GO TO TRIBAL.

1039
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,840
>> LET ME HELP YOU OUT A LITTLE

1040
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:06,007
BIT.

1041
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,008
THEY DON'T RESPECT ANYTHING

1042
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,635
ABOUT THE FANS.

1043
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,262
THAT'S BULL( BLEEP ), CORINNE.

1044
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:11,596
COMPLETE BULL.

1045
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,096
>> OKAY, BRANDON.

1046
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,766
>> DON'T PLAY THIS I'M COOL WITH

1047
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:15,683
THE FANS, PERIOD.

1048
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,435
THIS IS A FIRST TIME PLAYING AND

1049
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,312
YOU DESERVE A CHANCE, AND A FAIR

1050
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:19,979
CHANCE.

1051
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,939
DON'T TAKE CRAP FROM ANYBODY.

1052
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:22,857
YOU'RE THE UNDERDOG.

1053
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,900
I LOVE THE UNDERDOG.

1054
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,109
I WAS AN UNDERDOG, TOO.

1055
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,152
AND I STILL AM --

1056
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:29,113

"LISTEN, I'M GOING TO HELP YOU

00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,632
FANS OUT."

1070
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:48,800
EXPLAIN WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

1071
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:49,008
ABOUT.

1072
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,218
>> PHILLIP OVER HERE DECIDES TO

FREAKING PLASTIC DOLLS.

I'M NOT DOWN FOR THAT.

1079
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,064
AND PHILLIP SPEAKS SO HIGHLY OF

1080
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:03,272
HIMSELF.

1081
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,608
STOP TALKING ABOUT YOURSELF.

1082
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,526
BOSTON ROB TOOK YOU TO THE END

1083
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:07,026

YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!

1085
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,487
YOU WERE MADE FUN OF, AND YOU

00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,039
SO YOU AIN'T GOING TO TELL ME

1091
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,583

UP.

1099
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,103
YOU SEEM A LITTLE HOSTILE.

1100
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:42,437
>> JUST A TAD.

1101
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,856
>> Jeff: BUT I'M A LITTLE

1102
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,023
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT, BUT WE'LL

CONSTITUENT HERE AND TALK

1104
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:47,525
THROUGH IT.

THERE ARE SOME SPECIFIC

1109
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,156
INCIDENTS, BUT THAT IS PART OF

1110
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,157
"SURVIVOR" AND YOU'RE USED TO

1111
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:54,365
THAT.

1112
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,075
>> I HAD A ROUGH TIME AFTER THE

1113
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:56,284
SHOW.

1114
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,618
I HAD A REALLY ROUGH TIME.

>> Jeff: AFTER THE FIRST TIME

1116
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,037

>> AFTER THE FIRST TIME I PLAYED

1118
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,083
"SURVIVOR" IT CHANGED MY

1119
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,710
PERSONAL LIFE AND CHANGED

1120
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:06,794
EVERYTHING AND I SWORE IF I GOT

1121
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,087
A CHANCE TO PLAY AGAIN I WOULD

1122
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,214
NEVER PLAY THE SAME DAY WAYPIM

1123
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,258
WOULD NEVER BE THE GUY TO GET

1124
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,302
WALKED OVER BY EPISODE, BY

1125
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,179
EPISODE, BY EPISODE, CRYING.

1126
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,597
I CAN STAND HERE PROUDLY TODAY

1127
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,766
AND SAY I NEVER CRIED A

1128
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:20,767

1129
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,019
I CALLOSSED MYSELF TO PEOPLE WHO

1130
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:23,644
REALLY DON'T GIVE A ( BLEEP ).

1131
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,229
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYBODY

1132
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:28,149
BUT THEMSELVES.

1133
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:28,691
THAT'S PATHETIC, AND YOU'RE

1134
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,109
GOING NOWHERE IN WITH THAT

1135
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:33,863
ATTITUDE, IN LIFE OR IN

"SURVIVOR."

1137
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,281
>> Jeff: PHILLIP, GIVE ME SOME

00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,282
INSIGHT FROM THE OTHER SIDE.

1139
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,825
YOU HAVEN'T ACTUALLY MADE ANY

1140
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,661
REACTION DURING THIS EBB TIRE

1141
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:40,870

( IMITATING PHILLIP )

1145
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,253
>> I ATTEMPTED TO EMBRACE

1146
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,339
BRANDON AND HE WOULD SAY,

1147
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:51,589
"PHILLIP.

1148
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:52,965
WHERE I DO STAND?

1149
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,718
CAN I BE A PART OF THE ALLIANCE?

1150
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:56,344
THIS IS AFTER HE DECIDED TO CAST

1151
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,013
VOTES FOR ANDREA AT THE FIRST

1152
00:34:59,096 --> 00:34:59,347
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1153
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,682
>> Jeff: SORRY TO INTRURNGHT

1154
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:01,891
PHILLIP.

1155
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:06,646
NOW, ANDREA, YOU'RE EMOTIONAL.

1156
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,648
WHAT ARE YOU FEELING?

1157
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,149
>> FOR ME IT'S JUST-- IT'S JUST

1158
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:13,152
REALLY HURTS-- IT'S SAD TO SEE--

1159
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,196
I'VE GROWN CLOSE TO BRANDON OUT

1160
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,197
HERE, AND I CAN'T RELATE TO WHAT

1161
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,907
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

1162
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,867
AND IT'S HARD BECAUSE WE'RE ALL

1163
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:20,451
OUT HERE TO PLAY A GAME, AND

1164
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,328
WE'VE BEEN DOING SO WELL, AND WE

1165
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:25,123
HAD GREAT UNITY AND TO SEE TWO

1166
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,666
PEOPLE FIGHT AND SAY REALLY

1167
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,167
CRUEL THINGS TO EACH OTHER, IT

1168
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:28,376
REALLY--

1169
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,378
>> I SAID NOTHING TO BRANDON.

1170
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,672
>> OKAY, OKAY, SORRY, THEN I'M

1171
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:32,922
TALK AGO.

1172
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,841
>> PHILLIP SHEPPARD DOESN'T SAY

1173
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,259
NOTHING WRONG, EVER.

1174
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:39,053
HE'S SUPER SPY AGENT.

1175
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,220
3.0.

1176
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:39,470
SHUT UP.

1177
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,972
SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

1178
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,640
OWN UP TO WHAT YOU DO.

1179
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:43,266
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE 100 YEARS

1180
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,101
OLD DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVEN'T

1181
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,311
MADE A MISTAKE I CAME AND

1182
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:47,854
APOLOGIZE TO YOU.

1183
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,355
>> OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

1184
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,107
YOU'RE ONE PATHETIC INDIVIDUAL.

1185
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,400
>> YOU'RE PATHETIC.

1186
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,234
>> SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

1187
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,653
I'M TIRED OF YOU TALKING.

1188
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:56,362
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING--

1189
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,364
>> DON'T WALK THIS WAY.

1190
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,032
>> Jeff: BRANDON.

1191
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:00,241
BRANDON.

1192
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,868
COME HERE, COME HERE.

1193
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,327
I BROUGHT YOU OVER HERE FOR A

1194
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,371
REASON I BROUGHT YOU HERE FOR A

1195
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:05,580
REASON.

1196
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,874
NOBODY WANTS TO GET PHYSICAL.

1197
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:08,875
THAT'S NOT GOOD NEWS.

1198
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,960
>> HE DOESN'T WANT TO GET

1199
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:11,252
PHYSICAL.

1200
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:11,794
>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

1201
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:12,837
I DON'T.

1202
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,422
I REALLY, REALLY DON'T.

1203
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,173
>> Jeff: I DON'T WANT YOU TO

1204
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:16,674
GET PHYSICAL, ALL RIGHT.

1205
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:17,800
HEY, LOOK AT ME.

1206
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,093
>> I'M.

1207
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:19,844
>> Jeff: NO, NO.

1208
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,345
>> I'M DOING THIS FOR YOU, JEFF.

1209
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,222
>> Jeff: YOU'RE DOING THIS FOR

1210
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:23,514
ME?

1211
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,724
>> I'M NOT DOING --

1212
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,893
>> OH, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET

1213
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,394
PHYSICAL FOR ME.

1214
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:31,105
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME RIGHT NOW

1215
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:34,358
SAY YOU WILL NOT GET PHYSICAL.

1216
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:34,692
OKAY.

1217
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,777
DAUN, YOU ARE CAUTIOUSLY

1218
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:37,361
BREATHING IN AND OUT TRYING TO

1219
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,821
CALM YOUR BODY.

1220
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,615
>> I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE HERE.

1221
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,824
IT'S TOO STRESSFUL.

1222
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,075
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ALL THE

1223
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:43,326
NEGATIVE.

1224
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,368
I'M IN A GAME RIGHT NOW, TAKING

1225
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,244
ME OUT OF IT.

1226
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,163
>> DAWN, I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU

1227
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:47,747
WITH ALL MY HEART.

1228
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,540
YOU KNOW, I DO.

1229
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,374
ANDREA, I LOVE YOU.

1230
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,627
BUT I WANT TO BE THE AUTHOR OF

1231
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,336
MY FATE IN THIS GAME.

1232
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,588
AND THIS WAS MY THOUGHT PROCESS

1233
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:56,380
AND I WAS TALKING TO FILL.

1234
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,175
AND I SAID WHAT'S WRONG, MAN?

1235
00:36:59,258 --> 00:36:59,675
I WAS TRYING TO BE COOL.

1236
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,843
THEN I CLICKED.

1237
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,012
>> AND SAID YOU KNOW WHAT, SINCE

1238
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:03,638
YOU GUYS AREN'T EATING, WE'RE

1239
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,472
NOT GOING TO EAT, EITHER.

1240
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,599
SO I TOOK THE RICE AND DUMPED IT

1241
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:07,350
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

1242
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,851
I TOOK THE BEANS AND DUMPED IT

1243
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,228
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

1244
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,313
SO NOW YOU CAN STARVE WITH THEM.

1245
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,898
>> I DON'T THINK THAT THE WHOLE

1246
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,024
TRIBE DESERVES THAT.

1247
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:15,441
>> Jeff: CORINNE?

1248
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,484
>> .

1249
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,027
>> ALL RIGHT, I'M NOT GOING TO

1250
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:18,277
COMMENT.

1251
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,320
>> NONE OF US DESERVE THAT.

1252
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,197
>> Jeff: SO, BRANDON, YOU HAVE

1253
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,533
A VERY FAMOUS UNCLE IN THE

1254
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,285
"SURVIVOR" WORLD, RUSSELL HANTZ,

1255
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,453
WHO IS ONE OF THE MOST NOTORIOUS

1256
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,372
PLAYERS EVER.

1257
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,873
HAS ANYONE EVER ASKEDUE AND I

1258
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:33,042
SAY THIS WITH RESPECT BUT IT

1259
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,293
MIGHT NOT FEEL RESPECTFUL--

1260
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,586
>> I UNDERSTAND.

1261
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,338
>> Jeff: IS IT IN THE BLOOD?

1262
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,381
>> I'M STARTING TO COME TO THE

1263
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:41,467
CONCLUSION THAT US HANTZS, WE

1264
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,678
SPEAK OUR MINDS.

1265
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,553
I'M PROUD OF THAT.

1266
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,181
THAT'S SOMETHING I CAN WEAR

1267
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:47,515
PROUDLY.

1268
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,516
YOU ASK ME SOMETHING, I'M GOING

1269
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,059
TO TELL YOU.

1270
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:52,019
>> I JUST WANT TO SAY ONE THING,

1271
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:52,228
JEFF.

1272
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,354
I NEVER HAD ANY BAD FEELINGS

1273
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,730
TOWARDS BRANDON.

1274
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:55,898
>> I DIDN'T, EITHER.

1275
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:56,524
>> HERE WE GO.

1276
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,275
>> WHERE THIS IS COMING FROM, I

1277
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,987
HAVE NO IDEA.

1278
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,405
YOUR WHOLE THING ABOUT ME BEING

1279
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,031
IN CHARGE AND IN CONTROL IS JUST

1280
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,367
A FIGMENT OF HIS IMAGINATION.

1281
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,035
SO FOR HIM TO COME OUT HERE

1282
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,370
RIGHT NOW AND SPEW WHAT HE

1283
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,371
SPEWED, I HOPE YOU'RE STRONG

1284
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,374
ENOUGH TO REALIZE JUST MAYBE YOU

1285
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,709
MADE A MISTAKE.

1286
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:15,960
>> SHUT UP.

1287
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,295
>> THAT'S YOUR TYPICAL RESPONSE.

1288
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:18,587
>> SHUT UP.

1289
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:19,630
>> YOU NEED TO GROW UP.

1290
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,173
>> YOU NEED TO SHUT UP.

1291
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,425
GET A LITTLE BIT YOUNGER.

1292
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:23,968
>> THAT'S THE WAY YOU TALK TO

1293
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:24,635
YOUR ELDERS.

1294
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,762
THAT'S RIGHT, YOU DO, DO THAT.

1295
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,473
I REMEMBER WATCHING YOU TALKING

1296
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,183
TO YOUR UNCLE WHO LET YOU LIVE

1297
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:31,976
IN THE HOME.

1298
