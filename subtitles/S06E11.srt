00:00:01,292 --> 00:00:02,544
JEFF PROBST:
<i>Previously, on</i> Survivor:

2
00:00:02,627 --> 00:00:04,421
<i>Rob created a chain of command</i>

3
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:05,922
<i>to keep Matt and Butch busy.</i>

4
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:09,551
Butch is on, seriously,
on a need-to-know basis.

5
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:10,760
MATT:
We gotta be a chain,

6
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,554
from, like, a chain-link.

7
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:15,181
<i>Matt was afraid</i>
<i>of being viewed as a threat,</i>

8
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,559
<i>but it didn't matter</i>
<i>when Alex hit the mark</i>

9
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:20,603
<i>-and won the reward challenge.</i>
-Alex is drinking coffee!

10
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:24,232
<i>And he invited Jenna</i>
<i>to enjoy coffee and pastries.</i>

11
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,401
-This... is so nice.
-Mm. Mm.

12
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:27,652
To you, for winning.

13
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:31,281
<i>Back at camp, Deena was</i>
<i>concerned about Alex's victory.</i>

14
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,576
DEENA: We don't have a chance
if Alex is in this game.

15
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,953
PROBST:<i> With Alex and Jenna</i>
<i>back from the reward,</i>

16
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:39,789
<i>Heidi revealed Deena's plan.</i>

17
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,751
I'm not gonna
turn my back on them.

18
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,503
PROBST:<i> That night,</i>
<i>Heidi was bit by a spider.</i>

19
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:46,713
It's getting bad.

20
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,298
<i>So she had to be carried</i>

21
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,258
<i>to the immunity challenge</i>
<i>by Alex,</i>

22
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,427
<i>where the tribe</i>
<i>got a taste of the Amazon.</i>

23
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,970
(crunching)

24
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:55,430
PROBST:
Keep it down.

25
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:57,348
<i>When a live</i>
<i>beetle larva was more</i>

26
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,143
<i>-than Deena could stomach...</i>
-That is just nasty-ass!

27
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:03,188
-Go!<i> -...she felt secure enough</i>
<i>to give up immunity...</i>

28
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,814
You are safe
from the vote tonight.

29
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:05,982
-Cool.
-Nice effort.

30
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:07,150
<i>...but was shocked</i>

31
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,569
<i>at Tribal Council</i>
<i>when her alliance of Alex,</i>

32
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:12,822
<i>Heidi, Jenna and Rob</i>
<i>turned the tables on her.</i>

33
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,782
Ninth person voted out

34
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,493
and the second member
of our jury: Deena.

35
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,577
The tribe has spoken.

36
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,372
<i>Seven remain.</i>

37
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,708
<i>Who will be voted out tonight?</i>

38
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,255
ALEX:
The buff-- the multipurp--

39
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,882
-the multipurpose accessory.
-No kidding.

40
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,926
I still haven't
worn it as a tube top.

41
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,221
JENNA: You wear it as a tube
top, I'll wear it as a skirt.

42
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,806
-I know, that'd be fun.
-Then we'll be

43
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,892
-like the Bobbsey Twins.
-(laughs)

44
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:07,061
ALEX:<i> Jenna and Heidi and Rob</i>
<i>and I are having a blast.</i>

45
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,771
Game-wise, it's
working out great for us,

46
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,231
'cause we have a majority,

47
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,275
<i>and as long as</i>
<i>we control immunity,</i>

48
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,402
<i>it's the four of us</i>
<i>that are the final four.</i>

49
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,738
ROB:
<i>Catch any fish today?</i>

50
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:17,947
JENNA:
<i>No.</i>

51
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,407
ROB:
<i>One of them's gonna get fired</i>

52
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,117
<i>-if they don't soon.</i>
<i>-In three days?</i>

53
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,911
Yeah. They're
falling behind on what

54
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,829
they need to be
doing around here.

55
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,122
There's no firewood,

56
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,458
-there's no fish.
-(laughing)

57
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,627
-JENNA: They need to get
their acts together. -Yeah.

58
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,630
I'm booked all day,
thinking of funny things to say.

59
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,881
JENNA:
And I'm booked all day trying

60
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,008
to figure out a really cool
outfit to wear to the challenge.

61
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,302
ALEX:
<i>I'm enjoying this game a lot.</i>

62
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,470
<i>I mean, I knew that</i>
<i>I would meet cool people;</i>

63
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,472
<i>I never thought that</i>
<i>I would meet people that</i>

64
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:46,851
I consider friends that I want
to continue to be friends with.

65
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,604
JENNA: Like,
I consider you three, like,

66
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:50,980
-my best friends, like,
-HEIDI: That's it.

67
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,482
in and out of the game, though.

68
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,359
And not just here;
like, at home.

69
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,986
I'm an only child; I'm
so close with my mom and dad.

70
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,988
<i>Like, I just sit at home</i>
<i>and chill with them,</i>

71
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,490
<i>like, almost</i>
<i>every night of the week</i>

72
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,033
<i>and just eat and have fun.</i>

73
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,534
<i>I miss them.</i>

74
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,702
Plus, my mom's not well.

75
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,829
I left her, and she's...

76
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,707
you know, hopefully doing
really well while I'm gone.

77
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,835
HEIDI:
<i>Jenna's mom is sick.</i>

78
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,629
<i>She has cancer. I mean,</i>

79
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,130
we haven't heard
from our families

80
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,882
in gosh knows how long.
(laughs)

81
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,634
So, I mean, it's scary.

82
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:22,136
<i>And Jenna's just worried sick.</i>

83
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,305
JENNA:
<i>I think about them often,</i>

84
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,683
but it's nice to have
a core group of people

85
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,934
that I love here, also,

86
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:31,437
that's also made me not have
to think about them as often.

87
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,439
That really helps;
it really does.

88
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,372
ALEX:
<i>It's a little bit like...</i>

89
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,250
and I hate to say it, but it's
a little bit like high school.

90
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,918
<i>Jenna and Heidi, Rob and I have</i>

91
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,004
<i>the luxury of doing</i>
<i>a little less work</i>

92
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:59,507
<i>because we hold a majority,</i>
<i>and the other three know it.</i>

93
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,386
CHRISTY:
<i>I am a hard worker,</i>

94
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,514
and I know I'm a hard worker
and I don't mind working hard.

95
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:07,849
(wood clatters loudly)

96
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,183
<i>But sometimes it's, like,</i>
<i>come on, get off your butt</i>

97
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:13,146
<i>and go and get some wood</i>
<i>or go and try to do something.</i>

98
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,440
And they just do jack ...

99
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,071
Hey!

100
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,740
What am I missing?

101
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,159
MATTHEW:
<i>I find their behavior to be...</i>

102
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,745
<i>incomprehensible.</i>

103
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,583
<i>Maybe the final four</i>
<i>will be made up</i>

104
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,586
<i>of Rob, Alex,</i>
<i>Jenna and Heidi, but...</i>

105
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,922
<i>by betraying the other</i>
<i>three members of the tribe</i>

106
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,758
and treating them like dirt,

107
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,551
they've basically guaranteed

108
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,304
<i>that myself, Butch and Christy</i>
<i>will vote against them</i>

109
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:49,265
<i>if any one of them</i>
<i>makes it to the final two.</i>

110
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,892
BUTCH:
That's just...

111
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,478
ridiculous.

112
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,490
ROB:
Wait, hold on.

113
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,283
(laughs)
We have money!

114
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:10,286
-It is!
-(happy screaming)

115
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,412
Oh, my God!

116
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,955
(screaming)

117
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,665
Oh, my God! I have money!

118
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,000
Awesome.

119
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,588
I'm so excited!

120
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,672
Now, read-- read it.

121
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:22,965
Oh, my God, I am so excited,

122
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,467
I can't even control myself.

123
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,843
ROB:
"Easy come, easy go,

124
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,804
"you're invited to come
and play, you will compete

125
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,472
to get some treats,
but soon the offer goes away."

126
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,765
Does that mean we all

127
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,183
get something,
or is this a joke?

128
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,601
<i>The treemail said</i>
<i>something like</i>

129
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,311
they're gonna auction off,
you know,

130
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:38,272
make sure you place your bets
wisely for food.

131
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,817
-$500.
-Wow!

132
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,653
ROB: I'm tempted to say
screw the food; this is,

133
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,404
-like, my life savings.
-(laughter)

134
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,948
JENNA: I said, do we get
to keep the extra?

135
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:47,990
HEIDI:
Ditto.

136
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,330
PROBST:
Come on in.

137
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,456
Have a seat.

138
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,796
Welcome to the<i> Survivor</i> auction.

139
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,714
Very simple ground rules:

140
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,716
You each have $500.

141
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,885
There will be
a limited number of items.

142
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,305
But the same item may come up
for auction more than once.

143
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,349
Some items will be covered.

144
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:14,976
The auction
will stop without warning.

145
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,310
If you see something

146
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,021
you like, I suggest you
bid on it and not assume

147
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,524
something better
is coming down the pike.

148
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,443
-Shall we get started?
-Absolutely! -Yes, please.

149
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,738
Ready for the first item?

150
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,490
-(several talking at once)
-Absolutely!

151
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,868
PROBST: All right,
how about a piece of cheesecake.

152
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,995
We'll start the bidding at $120.

153
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,746
Hundred and twenty.

154
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,831
PROBST:
That's it?

155
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:37,665
Nobody else interested?
Once,

156
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,209
twice... sold to Heidi.
Come on up.

157
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,545
-This is all I've ever wanted.
-It's all you've ever wanted

158
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,380
in life-- here you go.

159
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:46,215
She would've, she would've
bid $500 on it.

160
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,260
-Good, girlfriend?
-MATTHEW: Oh, yeah.

161
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:53,264
-PROBST: Take it back
and enjoy it. -Okay.

162
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,682
-Next item.
-What's the opening bid?

163
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,434

-Got it.

164
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:57,768

338
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,099
$340 to Christy.

339
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,852
$340 to Christy--
once, twice.

340
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,187
Sold.

341
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,189
Come get your letter from home.

342
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,734
-PROBST: $340.
-(chuckles) I paid $340.

343
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,736
PROBST:
Right?

344
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,421
(Jenna sobbing)

345
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,839
I'm sorry.

346
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,841
-PROBST: It's all right, Jenna.
-Thanks.

347
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,065
It's okay.

348
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,115
Well, I don't want this
to be a bad thing.

349
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,992
The auction's supposed
to be fun.

350
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,912
I got these other letters here.

351
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,789
No reason we can't put
another one up for bid.

352
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:35,624
But only if Christy's good
with it,

353
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,960
because you paid
a hefty price for your letter.

354
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,628
You're okay with me
putting another one up?

355
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,422
Let's put another one up
for bid.

356
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,464
BUTCH:
Go for it, Jenna.

357
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,674
What do you want
to start with?

358
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,634
$80.

359
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,261
I'll go $80.

360
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,680
-One. $100.
-$100 to Heidi.

361
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,140
-I'll go $120.
-$120 to Jenna.

362
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,433
I don't think I have anymore.

363
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,478
$120 to Jenna.

364
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,272
Once, twice.

365
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,316
Sold to Jenna.
Letter from home.

366
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,151
All right.

367
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,528
(sniffling, crying)

368
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,822
Take this, and take
a private moment later

369
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:09,491
-and read it.
-Thanks, guys.

370
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,788
Not a bad way
to spend an afternoon.

371
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,540
Have a little peanut butter
and chocolate

372
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,833
and a little love from home.

373
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,668
Yeah. Thank you.

374
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,462
Auction over.

375
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,671
Thank you, guys.

376
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,341
Hope everybody had a good time.

377
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,134
Finish up your food.

378
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,803
You can head back to camp.

379
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,702
JENNA:
<i>When she outbid Heidi,</i>

380
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,787
I was like...
(sighs)

381
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,498
HEIDI: I didn't have
any money left to outbid her.

382
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,917
I was surprised that she
did that, but not really.

383
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,794
That's okay.

384
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:19,436
MATTHEW:<i> My feeling was that</i>
<i>Christy deserved the letter.</i>

385
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,274
<i>She's had a very bumpy ride,</i>
<i>and I realize that it</i>

386
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,485
would really elevate
her spirits,

387
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,154
raise her spirits,
and I felt she deserved it.

388
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,864
I thought Jenna
was being selfish.

389
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,415
This is from
a very good friend of mine.

390
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,584
Uh, I met her in high school.

391
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,461
Uh, her name's Jennifer,

392
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,589
and she is just
an amazing person.

393
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,925
CHRISTY:
<i>"I worry so much about you.</i>

394
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:52,261
<i>"Hope you're doing all right</i>
<i>with those hearing people.</i>

395
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,929
<i>"If they're giving you</i>
<i>problems,</i>

396
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:55,556
<i>"there's a whole other world</i>

397
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,058
<i>waiting for you</i>
<i>when you come home."</i>

398
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,728
<i>I mean, I've been here 28 days,</i>

399
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,439
and just reading these
and knowing that there's people

400
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,566
out there that love me,
it's just a...

401
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,067
<i>such a great feeling.</i>

402
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,111
<i>Maybe I can't trust</i>
<i>anybody out here,</i>

403
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,322
but I definitely
can trust people at home.

404
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,766
-JENNA (sobbing): It shrunk.
-HEIDI: It's okay.

405
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,142
It shrunk.

406
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,478
-Her tumor shrunk 50%.
-Nice.

407
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,188
It's almost gone.

408
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,981
(sobbing)

409
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:48,984
HEIDI:<i> She started crying</i>
<i>because her mom had written</i>

410
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:53,489
<i>that the brain tumor</i>
<i>had decreased by 50%.</i>

411
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,990
<i>I mean, it was just, like,</i>

412
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:56,325
one of the greatest things.

413
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,619
I started crying
because I was so happy for her.

414
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,662
-ALEX: That's fantastic.
-JENNA: Yeah, it is.

415
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,164
ROB:
Yeah, that's so great.

416
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,999
JENNA:
<i>Hearing from my family--</i>

417
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:06,168
<i>my mom and dad-- it's just...</i>

418
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,505
better than anything
I could've ever asked for.

419
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,673
It just helps you move on.

420
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,841
I just need to hear

421
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,302
<i>about how they were</i>
<i>and what they're doing,</i>

422
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,679
<i>and it's hard.</i>

423
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,681
But I'm glad.
It really was the best thing.

424
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,016
ROB:
<i>Yeah, that's so great.</i>

425
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:22,851
-That's enough for me.
-HEIDI: That is so great.

426
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,520
-Thanks, guys.
-That is so great.

427
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,480
-Thank you.
-That is great.

428
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,214
There's a lot of meat
on this one.

429
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,049
MATTHEW: Yep, that's...
that's a breakfast, dude.

430
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:55,425
That is a beautiful fish.

431
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,678
We haven't eaten that fish yet.

432
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:05,227
(whispering): I think
that we've got a great shot

433
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,855
if we work on Rob today

434
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:11,817
and get him to come
over to our side.

435
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,403
MATTHEW:
<i>Right now is a critical time.</i>

436
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:18,073
<i>There are a number of subgroups</i>
<i>that have formed.</i>

437
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:23,078
<i>One potential subgroup consists</i>
<i>of Alex, Heidi and Jenna,</i>

438
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:25,414
<i>and then there's Rob.</i>

439
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,958
(whispering): I think that if
we can get Rob to join us,

440
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:32,296
that'll give us four powerful
votes in Tribal Council.

441
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:35,173
It's got to be obvious to Rob
that he's expendable if he...

442
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,717
if he aligns himself with Alex.

443
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,887
BUTCH:<i> We don't want to get</i>
<i>in too big of a hurry.</i>

444
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:40,929
We don't want to rush this.

445
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,390
We don't want to try and
get it all done right now,

446
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,892
because, then,
sometimes it leaks out.

447
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,268
We can approach Christy
later on.

448
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,978
I can do that very delicately.

449
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,563
Because, right now, I mean,
she said

450
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:50,814
she doesn't trust anyone,

451
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,233
but I've had a lot
of very good conversations

452
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,110
-with her, and I like her.
-All right.

453
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:56,653
All right, let's get back,
'cause I don't want them

454
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,947
to come down
and see us talking this close.

455
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,075
MATTHEW:<i> I think that we've</i>
<i>got a great shot,</i>

456
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,994
<i>assuming, uh...</i>
<i>once they join us.</i>

457
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:08,248
Otherwise, Butch
and I and Christy will go

458
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,542
over the next three
Tribal Councils.

459
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,722
(fire crackling)

460
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:46,370
-How'd you sleep?
-Slept well.

461
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,082
So, Rob, I was thinking,

462
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:53,126
if the four of us go
to the final four,

463
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,836
I know that those two
have sworn to each other

464
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,964
-they're never going to vote
for each other. -Mm-hmm.

465
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,549
-So, the way I see it,
-Mm-hmm.

466
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,970
if I win immunity,
my vote goes for you,

467
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,888
and I'm sure that if
you win immunity,

468
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,349
you're going to vote me off,
and that's totally cool.

469
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,477
-I'm down. It's no worries.
-Okay.

470
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,853
Alex's decision to tell me

471
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,648
that he was going to vote me out

472
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:17,901
at the final four is really

473
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,236
<i>kind of curious.</i>

474
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,322
<i>I think it has to do</i>
<i>with this idea</i>

475
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,324
<i>that we're all</i>
<i>each other's best friends,</i>

476
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,410
<i>and even though I'm going</i>
<i>to be voted out fourth,</i>

477
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,787
I'm losing to three
worthy players.

478
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,332
ALEX: And if one of them
wins immunity,

479
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,042
then that's a whole nother
ball of wax,

480
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,086
and I don't know... I-I don't
know what... what happens then.

481
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,380
But I'm just saying
between you and I,

482
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,506
'cause we've been down
with each other

483
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,717
from the very beginning,
and I'll be honest with you

484
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,677
and just straight-up, and say...

485
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,762
you know, I mean,
'cause these two are never

486
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:46,680
going to vote
against each other.

487
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,682
-They told me as much, you know?
-Right.

488
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,684
They've sworn their lives
to each other, so...

489
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,394
that's, you know...?

490
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,396
So whatever happens at four
happens.

491
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,189
-You know what I mean?
-Uh-huh.

492
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,859
Are you cool with that?

493
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,569
ROB:<i> I realize</i>
<i>that I've been coming off</i>

494
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,404
<i>as very sensitive</i>
<i>with this group,</i>

495
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,531
talking about how much
I love them and how much

496
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:07,117
I'm going to be friends
with them aft-after the game,

497
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,911
but I have never stopped
playing<i> Survivor,</i>

498
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,581
<i>and over my dead body</i>
<i>will I turn over</i>

499
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,583
<i>and let somebody</i>
<i>just pass me by.</i>

500
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,251
All right, well,
we'll cross that bridge

501
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:17,919
-when we come to it.
-Yeah.

502
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,055
(snorting)

503
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,640
(hissing)

504
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:43,111
Bad news, guys.
It's the S.A.T.s.

505
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,488
-(laughter)
-Okay.

506
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,114
ALEX:
<i>We received a very interesting,</i>

507
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,116
<i>uh, little treemail</i>
<i>this morning.</i>

508
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,286
<i>There was big test booklets</i>
<i>with each of our name on it,</i>

509
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,455
<i>and it said to answer</i>
<i>all the questions,</i>

510
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,332
to not discuss it
with anyone.

511
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,584
"This is a confidential document

512
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,753
"which your fellow tribe members
will never see,

513
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:00,962
so please answer honestly."

514
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,256
<i>It's... obviously,</i>
<i>it means some kind of a game</i>

515
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,758
<i>to see if your answers match</i>

516
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,843
everyone else's--
we think, anyway.

517
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:07,969
<i>So it should be interesting,</i>

518
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:08,929
<i>when we get</i>
<i>to the immunity challenge,</i>

519
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,264
<i>to see how our answers</i>
<i>are used.</i>

520
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,561
CHRISTY:<i> Some questions</i>
<i>were easy to answer, like,</i>

521
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,648
"Who is the biggest
drama king or queen?" You know?

522
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,984
<i>Then it got to some, like,</i>
<i>"Who needs therapy?"</i>

523
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,820
<i>Or, "Who is the tribe slob?"</i>

524
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,822
It made me more aware and, like,

525
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,241
really, like,
think about who's who.

526
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:37,499
ROB:<i> The treemail was sort of</i>
<i>a slam book-type quiz.</i>

527
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:38,834
<i>Things like, uh,</i>

528
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,044
"Who would you trust
with your life?"

529
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,463
And a bunch
of very interesting questions

530
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,924
that really got me thinking
about a number of things.

531
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,139
Matt, this is the most
important conversation...

532
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:52,931
Yep.

533
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,724
...that I'm going
to have with you

534
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,184
-in this entire game.
-In this game.

535
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,186
MATTHEW:
<i>Rob and I had perhaps the most</i>

536
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,273
important conversation
of the game.

537
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,650
<i>He sat me down,</i>
<i>and he said, "Matthew,</i>

538
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,527
<i>"I'm going to lay out</i>
<i>what has happened</i>

539
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,988
over the past couple of weeks."

540
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,490
-First, I need to come clean
with you. -Okay.

541
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,868
Once we got to Jacaré,

542
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,536
I had been telling you

543
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,413
that the men
were going to stick together

544
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,665
after we got rid
of Roger and Dave,

545
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:19,833
-but that wasn't true.
-Right.

546
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:23,211
I'm telling you this because
I know that you trust me,

547
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,714
-Sure. -...and I don't want
to tell you any more lies.

548
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,842
-Sure. Okay. -I swear that this
is the honest truth.

549
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,219
MATTHEW:<i> He said that there</i>
<i>had been a lot of, uh,</i>

550
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,846
<i>times when I had been</i>
<i>in danger,</i>

551
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,890
<i>and people that I thought</i>
<i>were on my side</i>

552
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,683
<i>were actually plotting</i>
<i>against me,</i>

553
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:37,642
and on several occasions,

554
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,270
he was included
and was stringing me along.

555
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,730
Dude, you are...
are the only person

556
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,898
I really trust in this game--

557
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,525
-and Butch now, because he
has no options. -Well... yes.

558
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,319
That's going to change.

559
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:50,071
MATTHEW:
<i>Rob can be very underhanded,</i>

560
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:54,618
<i>but I appreciated his honesty,</i>
<i>and I appreciated</i>

561
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,911
what he had to say next.

562
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,746
Alex is the power player here.

563
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,206
He thinks that you're
the only person

564
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,916
that can beat him
in a physical competition,

565
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,751
and that's why he...
he wants you to go.

566
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,129
And Alex told me yesterday
that when we get to four,

567
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,756
he's going to vote against me.

568
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,132
He said that to you?

569
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,467
Yes. This is what happens

570
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,928
-when people start
being arrogant. -Right.

571
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,054
It's hubris.

572
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:16,139
MATTHEW:
<i>I was appalled</i>

573
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,557
at their audacity,

574
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:21,061
that they would go so far
as to say that...

575
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:24,606
that Alex, Jenna, Heidi and Rob
had wrapped it all up

576
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,358
and that it was merely
a question

577
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:29,444
of which one of the four
would win a million dollars.

578
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,613
Me, you, Butch and Christy
vote out Alex tomorrow.

579
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,281
That's what I was thinking.

580
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,242
If Alex wins immunity, I don't
know what we're going to do.

581
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,660
Well, dude,
I'll give you my word...

582
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:38,245
I'll give you my word on my...

583
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,288
I'll give my only word I'm
ever going to give in this game,

584
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,790
-Mm-hmm. -...and I...
I appreciate what you've said.

585
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,583
I will not betray you.
And you know what?

586
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,752
If it falls through,
then I'm out,

587
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:47,629
-but you're it, so...
-Right. Well, we're both...

588
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:48,755
-we're both out if this
falls through. -Okay.

589
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,591
MATTHEW:<i> I do have a lot</i>
<i>of survival skills,</i>

590
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,803
<i>but I am very ignorant</i>
<i>when it comes to...</i>

591
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,930
<i>the game and how it's played.</i>

592
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,516
<i>Rob has zero survival skills,</i>

593
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,434
but knows the game
inside and out.

594
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,311
I can get... get Christy,
no problem.

595
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,647
-She hates the two girls.
-Alex? Okay, great.

596
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,524
-And I think she
hates Alex, too. -Okay.

597
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,984
ROB:
<i>I am very aware</i>

598
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,986
of the arrogance of my alliance,

599
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:14,322
and I think that
is going to help me here.

600
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,992
<i>And I don't think it's</i>
<i>going to be very difficult</i>

601
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,451
<i>to sway the opinions</i>
<i>of the three people</i>

602
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,663
<i>that aren't in this alliance.</i>

603
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,207
What?

604
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,793
-What are you smiling about?
-Nothing.

605
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,504
(chuckling)

606
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,214
ROB:
<i>Christy is a sweet girl,</i>

607
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,842
<i>but she does not fit in</i>
<i>with this group.</i>

608
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,385
<i>I have a feeling</i>
<i>that a lot of girls</i>

609
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,137
<i>that were like Jenna and Heidi</i>

610
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,014
were very mean to Christy
in her... in her life.

611
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,183
CHRISTY:
So what are you thinking?

612
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,852
All I assume
was the four of you guys

613
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,353
made a pact, and just,
like, you guys

614
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,688
are going all the way,
so I'm going to be gone

615
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,064
-in the next nine days.
-Well, I just... I just...

616
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,190
I don't trust Alex anymore.

617
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,359
He's lied and changed his story,

618
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,321
a number of times,
on what he's going to do.

619
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,072
So are you thinking
of trying to get

620
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,408
Butch, Matt, you and me
to vote them out?

621
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,951
-To vote off Alex.
-Oh.

622
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,037
I-I-I'm up for voting Alex out.

623
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,080
-I knew you would be.
-'Cause I don't think

624
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,041
he plays fair, personally.

625
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,542
I'm, like, "Dude, I'm with you.

626
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,545
I'm with you to get Alex out,"
just because Alex...

627
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:13,673
Aah! I could care less
about him, and I just...

628
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:17,052
Ugh! And he's...
he's just, like...

629
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,722
<i>drooling over Jenna and Heidi,</i>
<i>and it's just, like, come on!</i>

630
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,683
<i>Then again, I don't know.</i>
<i>Can you really trust Rob?</i>

631
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,186
Is he really going to say that
to make us feel like,

632
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,520
well, we actually have a chance,

633
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,440
or is he just trying
to stir up something?

634
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,198
Come on in, guys.

635
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:46,247
Okay, at this point,
down to seven people.

636
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,916
Your awareness

637
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,251
of what is going on
within the tribe is critical.

638
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,754
The more you know
about your tribe mates,

639
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,756
chances are, the better
you're going to do.

640
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,925
That brings us
to tonight's immunity challenge.

641
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,718
This morning,
you were given questionnaires.

642
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,929
You answered the questions.
I've tallied the results.

643
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,473
For the immunity challenge,
you're going to have to guess

644
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:06,810
what the entire tribe said
as a whole-- what was the most

645
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,312
common answer given
for each question.

646
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,231
First one to five wins.

647
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,315
First things first.

648
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,901
Take back immunity.

649
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,160
Immunity back up for grabs.

650
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,787
First question:

651
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,498
Who would you trust
with your life?

652
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:32,585
Everybody reveal.

653
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,383
Correct answer's Butch.

654
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:39,676
How's that feel, Butch?

655
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,136
That's a pretty big statement.

656
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,595
Really makes me
feel good, and I would...

657
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,223
I would, um,
do my best to do it.

658
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,474
And you answered yourself.

659
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,767
Yes, I did.

660
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,310
Here's the score. Butch has one.

661
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,147
Rob has one. Jenna has one.

662
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,773
Next question:

663
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:58,445
Which tribe member
uses sex appeal as a weapon?

664
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,823
Everybody ready?

665
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:02,866
Reveal.

666
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:08,788
Interesting. Jenna says Heidi.

667
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:11,291
-(laughing)
-Heidi says Jenna.

668
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,127
Correct answer: Jenna.

669
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,670
Ooh.

670
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:18,006
-Surprise you?
-A little.

671
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:21,509
I don't know if I should feel
like people think I'm sleazy

672
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,637
or... that's really cool,
but... oh, well.

673
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,055
PROBST: But it's not new
to you, right?

674
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,682
Being a young woman using sex

675
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:29,017
-with men to...?
-Well, I-I...

676
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,685
I don't think
it's done purposely

677
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:32,979
to try to, you know,
snake anybody, but...

678
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,898
maybe by accident?

679
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,649
(chuckles) Said with a...
an adorable smile.

680
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,860
See? That's the thing.
Okay.

681
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:42,197
Heidi, Matthew, Christy
and Alex each get a point.

682
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,657
Everybody now on the board
with one.

683
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:48,161
Whose name came up the most
in answer to this question?

684
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,455
Who is the most honest?

685
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,212
Everybody got it?

686
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,255
Reveal.

687
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,050
Matthew.

688
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,885
Matthew guessed himself.
As a group,

689
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,386
everybody said Matthew
was the most honest.

690
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,722
One point for Matthew.

691
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:08,890
Matthew now has two.

692
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,767
Everybody else has one.
Playing to five.

693
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,519
Next question:

694
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,729
Of the seven of you,
who did the group say

695
00:30:14,812 --> 00:30:16,564
would never survive
on their own?

696
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,571
Reveal.

697
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,906
Lot of Jennas up there.

698
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,075
Jenna is the correct answer.

699
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,578
-Jenna? -I have no idea
why they said that, so...

700
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,914
-I have no comments.
-PROBST: No comments?

701
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,415
-No. -You're using sex
as a weapon.

702
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,875
You couldn't survive
on your own.

703
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,585
I-I... I don't know.

704
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,421
-Personal opinion.
-PROBST: Fair enough.

705
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,549
Matthew in the lead with three.

706
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:45,385
Rob, Christy, Butch have two.

707
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:48,304
Alex, Heidi and Jenna with one.

708
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:51,099
Who most needs therapy?

709
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,185
Reveal.

710
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,232
Matthew, once again, you guessed
yourself, and you're right.

711
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,484
-(laughter)
-MATTHEW: I'm a lunatic.

712
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,320
-What could I say? -Now, does it
bother you that they

713
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,281
-all feel that, too?
-No, 'cause we joke about it

714
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,907
all the time, and, uh, you know,

715
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:11,119
everyone thinks I'm crazy, so...
what can I say?

716
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,912
All right. Well, Matthew,
you're in the lead with four.

717
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,789
Rob right behind at three.

718
00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:16,082
Everybody else: two.

719
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:21,838
Who would you most like
to see pose nude in a magazine?

720
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:24,966
Very curious to see
what you guys say on this one.

721
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,593
Reveal.

722
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,181
Lot of Heidis up there.

723
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:35,018
-Oh, great.
-PROBST: Why Heidi, Alex?

724
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,519
Um, because when they
got naked last time,

725
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,730
Jenna was right next to me,
and Heidi was all the way

726
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,648
at the other end, so, you know,

727
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,568
I didn't get a good view
all the way at the other end.

728
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,653
-PROBST: Heidi is the
correct answer. -Dang it!

729
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,155
You said Jenna.

730
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,364
Surprised they said you?

731
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,575
Yes. She's gorgeous.

732
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,160
Make you want to strut
your stuff a little more?

733
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,495
-No. -JENNA: No.
-PROBST: No?

734
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,497
She's just as gorgeous.

735
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,625
-Aw. -PROBST: Here's
who got it right.

736
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,210
-Heidi, you didn't.
-I know.

737
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,795
Matthew, you didn't.

738
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,673
That puts Heidi
in last place with two.

739
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,509
The leaders:
Matthew and Rob tied at four.

740
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,011
Right behind them: Christy,

741
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,305
-Butch, Alex and Jenna,
-BUTCH: Yeah.

742
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,806
each with three.

743
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:17,644
Matt and Rob are one question
away from immunity.

744
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,438
Who in the tribe
do you have a crush on?

745
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:26,069
Whose name came up the most
often in answer to the question,

746
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:29,072
who do you have a crush on?

747
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,990
For immunity-- reveal.

748
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:37,246
Everybody said Heidi
except Matthew.

749
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,583
Matthew guessed himself,
and Heidi is correct.

750
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,752
Nice job, Rob.
Rob wins immunity.

751
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,587
Congratulations, dude.

752
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,382
-Good job, Rob.
-Good job, Rob.

753
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,217
-Well done. -Uh, can I
come get that necklace?

754
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,135
-Come on over, brother.
-HEIDI: Good job, Rob.

755
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,804
It's about time, baby.

756
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,055
Turn around.
Let me put this on you.

757
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,390
This is the best day
of my life.

758
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,100
Yeah. Good job, Rob.

759
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,893
-Yay, Rob.
-PROBST: Who knew you would be

760
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:00,436
the most in touch
with the tribe?

761
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,398
Oh, uh, these are my people.

762
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,982
You are their leader now.

763
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,943
-You are safe from the vote,
my friend. -Thank you.

764
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,195
But nobody else is.
Everybody else vulnerable.

765
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,238
Rob is the only one guaranteed

766
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,573
a one-in-six shot
at being the sole survivor.

767
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,826
You guys can head back to camp.

768
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:39,225
Last night--
like, I-I breathed a little bit

769
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:40,852
of a sigh of relief last night

770
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,478
-when Rob won.
-HEIDI: When Rob won. Yeah.

771
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,604
It was like, okay,
well, I know, you know,

772
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,605
that Matt's going to go next,

773
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,107
-and he's the biggest...
-Yeah.

774
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,151
-he's the biggest
physical threat. -Right.

775
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,862
ALEX:<i> Going to Tribal Council</i>
<i>tonight, and, uh...</i>

776
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,822
Jenna and Heidi and Rob and I

777
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:55,074
have decided that it's time
for Matt to go home.

778
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,201
He's just way too big
a physical threat.

779
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,289
Matt knows he's not
going past five.

780
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,750
-ROB: Uh-huh. And he did say it?
-Pretty much.

781
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,126
Yeah, he's like,
"You know, you make it

782
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,795
"to six or five,
that's really cool, you know.

783
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,505
"I'm just going to try really
hard at the immunities,"

784
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,340
and, well, I was like,
"You should have tried

785
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,301
a little harder last night."

786
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,303
(laughing)

787
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,514
ROB:<i> Tonight's Tribal Council</i>
<i>could signal</i>

788
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:22,477
<i>one of the most important</i>
<i>power swings in this game.</i>

789
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,647
I could vote with Alex,
Heidi and Jenna

790
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,484
and assure myself
a solid position

791
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,819
in the final four of this game.

792
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,696
ALEX: Well, when it comes down
to the four of us,

793
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,406
two of us are just going to,
you know...

794
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,866
whatever's going to happen
is going to happen.

795
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,826
ROB: Well, you think
it'll get... it'll get ugly...?

796
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,911
No, I-I don't think...
(stammers)

797
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,871
Like... like people cutting
side deals and stuff?

798
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,873
No, I don't think so.

799
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,125
We've been honest
with each other to this point.

800
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,877
-Good.
-Why... you know, why stop now?

801
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,379
-That's how I'd like
to keep it. -Yeah.

802
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:54,175
Or a more intriguing option
might be

803
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:58,387
<i>to vote with Christy,</i>
<i>Matt and Butch,</i>

804
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:01,516
<i>but the downside to that</i>
<i>would be to lose the trust</i>

805
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,518
<i>of all these people</i>
<i>that I've come so far with.</i>

806
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,521
It's possible to play the game
without hurting anybody

807
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,356
-in this group.
-Mm-hmm.

808
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:11,651
ROB:<i> I'm turning my back</i>
<i>on three people</i>

809
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,194
<i>who potentially would be</i>
<i>on the jury,</i>

810
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,029
<i>three people</i>
<i>that are definitely not</i>

811
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:17,114
<i>going to vote for me</i>
<i>in the final two.</i>

812
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,204
MATTHEW:
Look at those teeth.

813
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,581
Look at that mouth on this baby.

814
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,208
-That's so awful.
-This looks like a prehis...

815
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,125
I never liked fish before.

816
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,211
This looks like
a prehistoric, uh, fish.

817
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,838
Very pretty.

818
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,381
So you spoke to Rob.

819
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,882
-It's going to be good?
-Yeah.

820
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,509
Keep it quiet.

821
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:44,392
MATTHEW:<i> Tonight is going to be</i>
<i>a great night.</i>

822
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,477
I've got a strong agreement
with Rob.

823
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,771
<i>He really is the linchpin</i>
<i>in our plot</i>

824
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,607
<i>this evening to dethrone Alex.</i>

825
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,610
<i>But Rob can be very devious.</i>

826
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,279
<i>Rob has betrayed</i>

827
00:35:56,362 --> 00:36:00,241
a number of people
to get where he is today.

828
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,934
PROBST: Now bring in
the members of our jury--

829
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,353
Dave and the newest member,
Deena,

830
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,273
voted out
at the last Tribal Council.

831
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,239
30 days.

832
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:43,951
The seven of you have lasted
in the Amazon 30 days.

833
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,120
Congratulations.

834
00:36:46,203 --> 00:36:47,121
Thanks.

835
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:48,456
PROBST:
Sadly, for one of you,

836
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,334
30 days is as good
as it's going to get.

837
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,085
You'll become the third member
of our jury.

838
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,921
That is what is at stake
tonight.

839
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,923
Matthew, are you surprised
at how well

840
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,050
you're doing
after a month out here?

841
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,427
Yeah. I mean,
I had a pretty rough start.

842
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,804
I had very little energy
for a couple of weeks,

843
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,806
and I came back, and yeah,

844
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,143
I'm surprised that, uh,
my health is still intact.

845
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:10,478
PROBST:
Heidi, other than

846
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,355
a few spider bites
and things like that,

847
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,940
you're doing relatively well.

848
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,650
The first week was rough,

849
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,652
and I thought, "Okay,
if I can make it through this,

850
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:18,945
I can make it through anything."

851
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,697
And, uh, I did,
and I'm still here

852
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,741
and feeling really, really good.

853
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,743
PROBST: Alex, you gotta be
feeling pretty good

854
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,161
about how well
you're doing right now.

855
00:37:27,244 --> 00:37:28,287
You still look good.

856
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,622
You got a smile on your face.

857
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:30,790
30 days-- not bad.

858
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,667
I'm feeling pretty good.
Um...

859
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,710
I've had my rough spots
out here,

860
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,921
but yeah, I'm feeling
really good about, uh,

861
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,590
how well I'm doing and how good
I'm feeling after 30 days.

862
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,509
PROBST:
Christy, how about for you?

863
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,387
Now that you've weathered
an entire month out here,

864
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,514
these last nine days--
(splutters)-- piece of cake?

865
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,723
A piece of cake.

866
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,684
I can totally do it.

867
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,185
PROBST:
Let me bring up something

868
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:52,353
I'm noticing sitting here.

869
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,481
Jenna and Heidi,
you have a star--

870
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,525
I think a star-- on your face,
and you have a heart.

871
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,527
-It's a sun.
-HEIDI: It's a sunshine.

872
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,154
PROBST:
It's a sun. Okay.

873
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:05,574
Are you at all concerned
that by tattooing yourself

874
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,869
with one other person, you are
in a sense saying to the group,

875
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,622
"Well, I'm tight with Jenna,
so just know that."

876
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,625
It's not a concern because,
at this point in time,

877
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,586
certain people bond
more closely.

878
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,880
You know, not just me
and Heidi, you know;

879
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,424
maybe a couple other
people, too.

880
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,342
PROBST: Butch, is it
a risky move to make

881
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,720
a demonstrative display
on your face like that?

882
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,014
Um, sometimes I would think
it is, but this time,

883
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,390
I mean, they're just...
they're just together.

884
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,392
They, um...
we're included, sometimes,

885
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,852
in some talks
or casual conversation.

886
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,229
We'll make comments,
but on a whole,

887
00:38:35,312 --> 00:38:36,856
they're in there
talking a lot together.

888
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:39,317
PROBST: Rob, is it
important in this game

889
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,069
to really know your tribe mates,
or is it only important

890
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,030
to know the people
you're aligned with?

891
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,323
I think that the biggest part
of this game

892
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,950
that often gets overlooked

893
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,911
is interpersonal relationships,
and not necessarily

894
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:54,373
the people that you say,
"Okay, these are my friends."

895
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:58,252
It's getting to understand
what's going through the heads

896
00:38:58,335 --> 00:39:00,379
of everybody
that's around in the game.

897
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,424
Heidi, would you be
somewhat surprised

898
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,051
if you were voted out tonight?

899
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,427
Yes.

900
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:10,097
Hmm. Alex, be
a little bit surprised

901
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,099
-if tonight it's you?
-ALEX: Sure.

902
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,310
I'd be pretty surprised
if I got voted out.

903
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,478
Christy.

904
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:18,272
I would not be surprised
in a heartbeat.

905
00:39:18,355 --> 00:39:19,648
Rob, you're wearing
the immunity necklace.

906
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,941
I know you don't want
to give it away.

907
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,444
Rob is the only one
you can't vote for.

908
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,321
Everybody else is on the block.
It's time to vote.

909
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,489
Christy, you're up.

910
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,927
He crossed me once.

911
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,595
I forgave him.

912
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:51,305
He crossed me twice.

913
00:39:51,388 --> 00:39:54,016
<i>I offered reconciliation.</i>

914
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,435
His reign is over.

915
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,990
You're way too much
of a threat,

916
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,784
and, uh, it's time
for you to go.

917
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,328
<i>Take it easy, buddy.</i>

918
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,604
I'll go tally the votes.

919
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,740
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

920
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,075
Person voted out will be asked

921
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,702
to leave the Tribal Council area
immediately.

922
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,120
I'll read the votes.

923
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,582
First vote.

924
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,294
Alex.

925
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,005
Alex.

926
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,506
Two votes Alex.

927
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:12,344
"Matteo." Matt.

928
00:41:15,472 --> 00:41:17,391
Matt.
That's two votes Matt,

929
00:41:17,474 --> 00:41:19,435
two votes Alex.

930
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,231
Matt.
Three votes Matt,

931
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,400
two votes Alex.

932
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,529
Alex.

933
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,782
Three votes Alex,
three votes Matt.

934
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,826
I'll read the last vote.

935
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,288
Tenth person voted
out of the tribe

936
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,081
and the third member
of our jury:

937
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,043
Alex.

938
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:46,420
Need to bring me your torch.

939
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,601
Alex, the tribe has spoken.

940
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,104
Take it easy, you guys.

941
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,940
MATTHEW: Good luck.
Good luck, dude.

942
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,662
Well, judging
by the looks on your faces,

943
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,288
I'd say that tonight's vote

944
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,082
was certainly a surprise
to at least a few of you.

945
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:24,583
I guess there is a lot
of talking

946
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,252
to be done, once you get
back to camp.

947
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:27,753
You guys can head back.

948
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,755
