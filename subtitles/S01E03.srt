JEFF PROBST:
<i>16 Americans forced</i>
<i>to abandon ship</i>

2
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:08,299
<i>in the middle</i>
<i>of the South China Sea.</i>

3
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:11,469
<i>Marooned for 39 days</i>

4
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:14,097
<i>they must work together</i>
<i>to build shelter,</i>

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,558
<i>find food</i>
<i>and survive the island.</i>

6
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:20,311
<i>But ultimately, it is</i>
<i>everyone for themselves.</i>

7
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:23,440
<i>Every third night, they will</i>
<i>hike deep into the jungle</i>

8
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,442
<i>to take part</i>
<i>in the Tribal Council</i>

9
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:29,446
<i>where they must vote one</i>
<i>of their own off the island.</i>

10
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,448
In the end, only one will remain

11
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,282
<i>and will leave the island</i>

12
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,284
<i>with $1 million in cash.</i>

13
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,331
<i>Last week on</i> Survivor...

14
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:43,126
<i>B.B's anger</i>
<i>with the Pagong Tribe</i>

15
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,794
<i>reached a fevered pitch.</i>

16
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,296
I've been working
my ass off.

17
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,131
A lot of you have been
laying on your ass watching me.

18
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:48,631
Put the carrying log--
we're right in...

19
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,300
all the way over now.

20
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:53,219
If we're building a health gym,
I'll let you do it.

21
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,345
Damn it. Walk
straight in.

22
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,140
It may not be that right,
but how many times we got

23
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:57,974
to make those decisions?

24
00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:00,143
JEFF:
<i>At Tagi, the conflict</i>

25
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,479
<i>between Stacey and Rudy</i>
<i>deepened.</i>

26
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,147
RUDY:
<i>Me and her wouldn't get along.</i>

27
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,815
<i>If we were friends</i>
<i>on the outside</i>

28
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,484
I'd definitely avoid her.

29
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,152
STACEY:
<i>We've all seen him</i>
<i>eating extra food,</i>

30
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,695
<i>and he's just sort of</i>
<i>a liability to us.</i>

31
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,447
He was sitting around
barking orders

32
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,115
and not really helping out much.

33
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,158
RUDY:
<i>She's too prim-like, you know.</i>

34
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,159
<i>I mean, uh,</i>

35
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,328
after about three weeks
out here in this jungle

36
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,330
she's going to learn a lesson,
I think.

37
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,416
JEFF:
<i>And Richard shared openly</i>
<i>with his tribe mates.</i>

38
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,628
There is a lifestyle
associated with being gay,

39
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,838
but you can't say
I decided to be gay.

40
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,842
RUDY:
<i>The homosexual, he's one</i>
<i>of the nicest guys I ever met.</i>

41
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,845
<i>Me and Richard got to be</i>
<i>pretty good friends--</i>

42
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,348
not in a homosexual way,
that's for sure.

43
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:41,017
JEFF:
<i>At the immunity challenge,</i>
<i>Stacey pulled through</i>

44
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,020

<i>the final unappetizing round...</i>

45
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:45,688

<i>...forcing Pagong</i>

48
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,486
<i>to the Tribal Council</i>

49
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,197
<i>where B.B.'S</i>
<i>volatile personality</i>

50
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,199
<i>finally caught up with him.</i>

51
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,408
"B.B."

52
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,035
B.B., the tribe
has spoken.

53
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,539
It's time
for you to go.

54
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,540
All right.

55
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,874
JEFF:
<i>14 Are left.</i>

00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,002

I keep forgetting
where I am...

59
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,953
when I wake up.

60
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:24,871
The plan now is to go out

61
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,123
and try to do
some early morning fishing.

62
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,546
SEAN:
<i>Fishing is horrible.</i>

63
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,299
<i>That saying, "There's</i>
<i>a lot of fish in the sea"?</i>

64
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,508
<i>Not this sea.</i>

65
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,802
They apparently didn't grow up
in Palua Tiga,

66
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,597
uh, because there is nothing
to be caught out there.

67
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,642
SUSAN:
<i>As far as</i>
<i>the food holding up, uh,</i>

68
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,478
I don't... I think
we're into day seven.

69
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,856
I lost track, but I know
it's starting to whittle down.

70
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,316
I know we got to get fish
in here.

71
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,525
(<i> conch shell being blown</i> )

72
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,945
SUSAN:
You want to check
the one on the left first?

73
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,155
KELLY AND STACEY:
We're going by that first.

74
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:00,949
KELLY:
Come on,
fish in the trap.

75
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:04,327
Rocks do not want to take
her down on that one end.

76
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,703
Okay.

77
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,667
Nothing.

78
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,127
Bait's all gone.

79
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,963
KELLY:
<i>This is frustrating.</i>

80
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,965
I mean, it's the ocean.

81
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:21,302
You think you'd get a fish
somehow, but no luck so far.

82
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,180
<i>We all thought, "Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>you know, we got these traps,</i>

83
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:25,890
<i>we got hooks, we got a raft."</i>

84
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,351
<i>You know, there's no reason</i>
<i>why we shouldn't be having</i>

85
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,311
<i>big, fat fish for dinner</i>
<i>every night,</i>

86
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:30,979
<i>but we're just not.</i>

87
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,397
To me, that's kind of like

88
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,483
uh, yeah, whoo-hoo,
big survivors, you know?

89
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,569
When was the last time
Rudy went on a water run?

90
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,029
He never did, did he?

91
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,030
I don't think
he's been

92
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,198
on a water run.

93
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:42,740
He's sneaky.

94
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,201
He is.
He's sneaky.

95
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:46,703
He swipes food

96
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,163
while he's in there
cooking in the kitchen.

97
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,708
STACEY:
<i>I think we've all sort of</i>
<i>come to the conclusion</i>

98
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,584
<i>that Rudy really needs</i>
<i>to get out of here.</i>

99
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,336
He just criticizes
whatever we're doing.

100
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,713
He's hurting morale.

101
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,048
We row out yesterday morning
and set the traps.

102
00:04:59,132 --> 00:04:59,924
I come into the kitchen.

103
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,384
"Morning, Rudy,
how are you doing?"

104
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,886
"You're wasting your time
out there.

105
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,596
It's just a waste."

106
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,098
I was, like, "Damn,
morning to you, too."
What the hell.

107
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:10,184
SUSAN:
Well, he's wasting his time
by doing nothing, though.

108
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,395
KELLY:
<i>I think we were all</i>
<i>kind of stoked that, you know,</i>

109
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,688
<i>yeah, he's an ex-Navy Seal,</i>

110
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,148
<i>We're going to kick ass.</i>

111
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,316
<i>But he really hasn't</i>
<i>contributed very much.</i>

112
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,068
I think it's definitely
going to influence me

113
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,445
the next time I go
to Tribal Council.

114
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,947
I think it's influencing
all of us, you know.

115
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,910
When it comes down, you know,

116
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,621
to-to voting people
that we do like off, I...

117
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,916
it's sucky, but I think
it's going to come down

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,626
to whoever screws up
at the challenges.

119
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,422
SUSAN:
Yeah, 'cause I already
know who I'd vote for.

120
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,549
The person that's least
contributing to the group...

121
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:44,427
out of here.

122
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,511
<i>I have conflicts--</i>
<i>personality conflicts</i>

123
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,889
every day with people.

124
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,640
I deal with them, I work with
them, I live with them, I go on.

125
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,225
I'm going to do
the same thing here:

126
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,226
I'm going to get rid

127
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,895
of the weakest member
and vote Stacey out.

128
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:57,899
<i>Stacey's trying to buddy up</i>
<i>with everybody</i>

129
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,609
<i>because she knows</i>
<i>she's the weakest.</i>

130
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,652
STACEY:
<i>When Kelly, Sue and I</i>
<i>were on the raft</i>

131
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:02,653
<i>we talked about</i>
<i>who we'd vote off.</i>

132
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,573
Sue initially didn't want
to talk about it,

133
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,241
<i>which immediately clued me in</i>

134
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,202
<i>that she was planning</i>
<i>to vote me off,</i>

135
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,745
<i>even though we decided</i>
<i>to stick together.</i>

136
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,622
So now I don't trust her
as far as I can throw her,

137
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,499
which, according to the group,
would be not far.

138
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:17,168
Did you catch
anything?

139
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,294
SUSAN:
No fish.

140
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,463
We set the
traps up though.

141
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,631
Set the fish traps?

142
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,799
That's it?

143
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:23,966
Just... yeah, no fish.

144
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,095
We didn't fish
but 20 minutes.

145
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,644
COLLEEN:
<i>The oomph is a little gone</i>
<i>from our group.</i>

146
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,146
<i>I don't know why that is.</i>

147
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,482
I think that not eating
is a factor of our mood.

148
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,317
We want food.

149
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,152

<i>mashed-potato style</i>
<i>tapioca root.</i>

153
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,951
It's tapioca, for sure.

(<i> all chuckling</i> )

155
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,495
Just take a bite,
and see what...

156
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,665
No. Maybe it's just tapioca
run wild.

157

(<i> chuckling</i> )

158
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,878
Operation Tapioca has everything
to do with finding tapioca,

on the way, too.

00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,254
<i>like, you know,</i>
<i>Lord of the Flies,</i>

171
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,714
<i>and, uh, I think the others</i>

172
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,091
<i>were quite interested</i>
<i>in our discovery</i>

173
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,509
so we took a group field trip.

174
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,887
What is wrong
with you people?

175
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,138
Oh, my God!

176
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,396
GERVASE:
<i>It was a great feeling.</i>

177
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,107
<i>It's just like a nice little</i>
<i>celebration for everybody.</i>

178
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,235
You get together,
just get dirty,

179
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,738
<i>and have a little fun--</i>
<i>have a couple of laughs.</i>

180
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,364
COLLEEN:
Whose leg is...?

181
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:14,118
Now we really don't
want to be voted off.

182
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,704
JENNA:
<i>But it's also just to get away</i>
<i>from the daily grind here.</i>

183
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,873
I mean, we're going to be here
39 days.

184
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,416
You got to keep yourself happy.

185
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,778
RUDY:
<i>I seen Dirk</i>
<i>reading his bible today.</i>

186
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,781
I didn't know
he brought a bible.

187
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,866
"For out of the heart
come evil thoughts:

188
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,785
"Murder, adultery,

189
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,288
sexual immorality, theft,
false testimony, slander."

190
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,083
DIRK:
<i>I just need that quiet time,</i>

191
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,585
and especially
a lot of that quiet time

192
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,629
includes just praying
and meditating

193
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,089
<i>and praising God.</i>

194
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,799
<i>That's kind of where I feel</i>
<i>all my strength and energy</i>

195
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,176
<i>comes from.</i>

196
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,429
<i>My testimony is not something</i>
<i>I'm afraid to share,</i>

197
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,806
and that's just part
of getting to know people

198
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,475
and at a deeper
and deeper level.

199
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:21,978
See, the Ten Commandments
was an old covenant

200
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,938
that the Hebrews...
that God's chosen nation--

201
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,773
the Israelites,

202
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:28,442
the Hebrews--
had signed with him,

203
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,819
but when Christ came,

204
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,946
he opened the door
to every human being on Earth.

205
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,823
SUSAN:
<i>I can only take</i>
<i>so much preaching.</i>

206
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,076
I went to church,
I put my time in.

207
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,120
I believe in God and all that,
but to constantly

208
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,664
everything always come back
on to "Jesus, Jesus"...

209
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,332
yeah, Dirk's about
driving me wild with that.

210
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,300
It's getting even prettier
and prettier.

211
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,135
Well, thank you.

212
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,637
STACEY:
<i>I think Dirk has</i>
<i>a little crush on Kelly.</i>

213
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:57,722
He doesn't have
a chance in hell.

214
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:01,309
Stacey came up to me,
"Yeah, I think he likes you."

215
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,227
I was just, like, "oh, great,"
you know?

216
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,729
<i>I-I didn't come out here</i>
<i>for that, you know?</i>

217
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,315
<i>We don't need that.</i>

218
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,192
DIRK:
<i>Kelly's got</i>
<i>a serious boyfriend,</i>

219
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,569
and unless she tells me
otherwise,

220
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,029
that's a line
I'm not going to cross.

221
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,531
I love<i> you.</i>

222
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,867
But we're--
it's a platonic type of love.

223
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,869
I think he's really
sexually frustrated.

224
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,871
I've gone 23 years
without sex.

225
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,497
I think you guys
can go seven weeks.

226
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:23,873
SUSAN:
I went a year one time.

227
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:24,874
Oh, my God!

228
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,376
SUSAN:
You should
try it sometime.

229
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:27,960
You might like it.

230
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,837
It's just funny, but...

231
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,380
I know
you'll like it.

232
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,423
No, I know I'm
going to love it.

233
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,007
You'll come back.
You'll come back.

234
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,717
It's a gift from God.

235
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,885
There's no doubt, man.

236
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,553
I'm obviously not a virgin,

237
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:38,888
but if he, uh...

238
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,098
that's how he wants
to live his life, that's cool.

239
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,393
<i>You don't meet too many</i>
<i>23-old guys who are virgins.</i>

240
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,354
He's interesting,
being a virgin, 23,

241
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,855
<i>and not, uh, thinking</i>

242
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,733
<i>about crossing that line</i>
<i>till marriage-- hoo!</i>

243
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,109
<i>He's extraordinarily religious,</i>

244
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,278
<i>and I don't know</i>
<i>that we'd ever be real close</i>

245
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,237
<i>because we're on such</i>

246
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,864
different ends
of the spectrum religiously.

247
00:10:56,947 --> 00:11:01,243
DIRK:
<i>Rich, you know...</i>
<i>homosexual people tend to talk</i>

248
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,328
about their homosexuality

249
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,580
<i>all the time,</i>
<i>and it's really annoying to me.</i>

250
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:06,791
It's seems like
you talk about sex an awful lot.

251
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:07,792
Nobody's going to tell me
what not to do

252
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,294
or what not to talk about.

253
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,213
If it's offensive
to anybody

254
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,632
I stop immediately.

255
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,093
DIRK:
<i>Maybe that's just me,</i>
<i>but if he could cut that out</i>

256
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,761
<i>it'd almost be perfect</i>
<i>around camp.</i>

257
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,770
Day seven on the island.

258
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,564
After Pagong's visit
to Tribal Council

259
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,109
both tribes are now even
at seven members.

260
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,902
Today we'll see what effect
losing B.B. has on Pagong

261
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:38,614
as they prepare
for their next challenge.

262
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,117
Both tribes will have their work
cut out for them today,

263
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,994
as it requires strength,
endurance,

264
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,830
and most importantly, teamwork.

265
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,249
Try to go this one alone...

266
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,001
you'll never make it to shore.

267
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,013
Yes!

268
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,932
It's underwater.

269
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,149
"Lucky for you there's
not much to do

270
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,943
"to prepare for
the next big race.

271
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:16,986
"Just hold on tight,
use all your might

272
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,655
and stay down till
you're blue in the face."

273
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,157
Oh, we're going
to go diving.

274
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,700
Hold your breath.

275
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,160
"Gasping for air,
weight you can't bear,

276
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,953
"before you're done
you may quit,

277
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,414
"the fish you desire
are yours to acquire

278
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,167
if you're the first
to the sand spit."

279
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,294
Yeah, though, it's got
to be underwater,

280
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,462
holding your breath,

281
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,005
getting something
and getting somewhere.

282
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,006
Okay.

283
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,340
Come on, Seal.

284
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,009
Who could do that?

285
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,343
Well, that's what it is.

286
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:41,969
You know you're diving
for something.

287
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,353
Something underwater,
I'm thinking.

288
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,189
Yeah.

289
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,565
It's underwater today.

290
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:55,441
Cool.

291
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,651
Either lifting something
from the bottom

292
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,486
or carrying it
underwater,

293
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,862
or a distant swim
underwater

294
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,363
or something.

295
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,865
GERVASE:
<i>The thing is this:</i>

296
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,992
<i>everybody knew coming in</i>
<i>water wasn't my thing--</i>

297
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,035
<i>swimming wasn't my thing,</i>
<i>and my team</i>

298
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,454
<i>knew it from the beginning,</i>

299
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,539
<i>so when we get into any kind</i>
<i>of swimming situation,</i>

300
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,083
if it's actual swimming,
we're going to be struggling.

301
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:13,918
You know, they have
to compensate for me.

302
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,337
But that's what a team does.

303
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:51,956
JEFF:
Hey, guys.

304
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:55,251
ALL:
Hey!

305
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:55,960
Tagi, you, you saw
they're missing a member.

306
00:13:56,043 --> 00:14:00,089
B.B. got voted off last night.

307
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,924
Today's challenge
is a reward challenge.

308
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,175
You won't be playing
for immunity today.

309
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,094
That'll happen later.

310
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,096
Today's challenge strictly
for a reward

311
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,516
that includes a fishing spear.

312
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,475
Here's the game...

313
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,893
it is a team game.

314
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,562
Big emphasis on the tribe.

315
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,063
What you're going to do is
you're going to swim out

316
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,524
to the inner tubes
out in the water.

317
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,610
Directly below the inner tube
on either side

318
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,278
<i>is a sunken treasure chest.</i>

319
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,780
<i>Get that chest back here</i>

320
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:25,990
up on your platform.

321
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:29,743
The game is over when one tribe
has their chest here

322
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,829
and every member
has a hand on the chest.

323
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,372
The only rule is

324
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,583
you can't dive down
to get the chest

325
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,002
until everybody is out there
with a hand on the inner tube.

326
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,628
So the race really starts here.

327
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,046
The quicker everybody
gets out there

328
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,340
the quicker you can dive down
and start to move it.

329
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,091
Anything not clear?

330
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,260
No?

331
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,261
Survivors, ready?

332
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,637
Ready.

333
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,638
Go!

334
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,665
Go! Here we go!

335
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,375
We're going down.

336
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,016
I think you're...

337
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:34,391
I can't get
ahold of it.

338
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,229
Everybody...

339
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,357
Get your hand up.

340
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,550
(<i> indistinct chatter</i> )

341
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:24,066

(<i> all talking</i> )

346
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,742
Got it?

347
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:15,784
I got it.

348
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,326
Come on! Come on!

349
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,203
Stay with us, here...

350
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,629
Hell, yeah.

351
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,964
Our beach now, baby.

352
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:29,590
That's right, baby.

354
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,093

Put your hands on it!

355
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,929

356
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:36,972
Whoo!

357
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:37,806
Way to go.

358
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,141
Bring it in, guys,
bring it in.

359
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,309
Nice job.

360
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,351
Man, way to get
it done, Rudy.

361
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,353
...than I imagined
it would be.

362
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,271
By the time you get
out, you're so...

363
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,774
Good work, guys.

364
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,025
JEFF:
All right, here's the deal.

365
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,318
The key, Mr. Hatch,
if you'd like,

366
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,195
to grab right there.

367
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,821
Yeah, Rich,
go get it, baby.

368
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,114

RICHARD:
<i>Yesterday's competition</i>
<i>was great.</i>

376
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,279
That was the, uh, pulling
the treasure up from the water,

377
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,365
dragging it in and getting
a mask and snorkel.

378
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,033
Oh, baby, that made me
feel good.

379
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:40,744
<i>I wanted that mask and snorkel</i>
<i>from day one...</i>

380
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,871
<i>to go get, uh, fish.</i>

381
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,516
SEAN:
<i>Rich, he overestimates himself</i>
<i>sometimes,</i>

382
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,184
and we were kind of thinking

383
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,185
that he wasn't going
to catch anything.

384
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,436
<i>When you snorkel down there,</i>

385
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,647
<i>there's nothing</i>
<i>to even stab at.</i>

386
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,358
We have a good pole.

387
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,902
I have my Superpole.

388
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,696
Uh, which is, you know,
it works--

389
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:16,446
in a<i> Gilligan's Island</i>
<i>sort of sense.</i>

390
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,949
We got some maggots,

391
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,701
we got the Superpole 2000

392
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,203
and we got the persistence
of Dirk and me.

393
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:23,453
We can't lose.

394
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,335
Feeling good today,
buddy.

395
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,923
We got to come back
with fish tonight.

396
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:35,591
If somebody gets a fish
on a spear

397
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,718
I'll be seriously impressed.

398
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,720
So will I. Let's see
if he can do it.

399
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,430
Well, Rich is confident, man.
I appreciate...

400
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,098
If I was a little
fish and saw Rich swimming out,

401
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,558
I wouldn't be
sticking around long.

402
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,685
Big gay man
with a spear
coming right at me.

403
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,299
Oh, it's a ray.

404
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:17,716
I don't know if
it's an angel ray

405
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,301
or a sting ray.

406
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,137
RICHARD:
<i>This is a good moment for me,</i>
<i>'cause I knew people</i>

407
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,473
were thinking
I was just full of<i> caca.</i>

408
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,474
And it was just...

409
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,142
<i>you know, one of those things</i>

410
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:28,852
<i>that I've been</i>
<i>talking about fishing,</i>

411
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,313
<i>talking about what I've</i>
<i>been doing all my life...</i>

412
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,773
We're supposed
to eat that thing?

413
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:33,982
I will.

414
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:34,566
Just to make note

415
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,526
who got the first fish.

416
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,320
It's not a fish;
it's a ray.

417
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,488
Oh! Oh!
You suck.

418
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,490
I'm coming back
in a second

419
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,116
with a fish.

420
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,452
<i>I actually think Sean</i>
<i>was kind of sad</i>

421
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,495
that I beat him.

422
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,554
All right.

423
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:16,650
Another ray, huh?

424
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,652
Now you got two.

425
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,404
Do we want another ray?

426
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,530
We don't know
if they taste good

427
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,115
or if they're edible.

428
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,033
Sean said, "Get something
that looks like a fish."

429
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:25,951
This is a fish.

430
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,036
Look at that,
doesn't that look delicious?

431
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,871
No more rays.

432
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,623
Catch a fish.

433
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,291
If I see a fish,
I'll get a fish.

434
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,710
But if I get rays,
I'm going to get rays.

435
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,211
There are seven people to feed.

436
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:37,546
I don't know
if they taste good.

437
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,380
I'm not sure I'm
following the logic.

438
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,091
I mean, you're sitting here
Right..

439
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,134
For what?

440
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,553
I see a fish or something
that looks like a fish--

441
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,555
I mean, I'll eat whatever.

442
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,181
Finally, when I came up
with a third one

443
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,266
<i>they said,</i>
<i>"Good job, good job."</i>

444
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,018
Good work.

445
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,185
SEAN:
<i>He pulled through.</i>
<i>He showed his true colors.</i>

446
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,979
<i>He does know how to spear fish.</i>

447
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,397
<i>He got us a couple of,</i>

448
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,440
uh, manta rays or whatever
the hell they were.

449
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,566
We got fish.

450
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,986
No way! No way!

451
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,070
(<i> screams</i> )

452
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,947
Watch the spear.

453
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,073
Hey, baby.

454
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,199
Oh, hell, yeah.

455
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,367
We're eating dinner.

456
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,494
RICHARD:
<i>My position with the tribe--</i>

457
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,872
it's probably going to increase
as a result of this.

458
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,583
<i>I talk about the things</i>
<i>that I'm capable of doing</i>

459
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,585
<i>and this might give them that</i>

460
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:20,213
<i>"Oh, maybe some of what</i>
<i>he's saying is true."</i>

461
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,259
They're, uh, pretty,

462
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:26,094
pretty damn tasty.
I recommend

463
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,721
keep catching those...
they appear to be

464
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,264
slow, slow, slow.

465
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:30,766
Or you know how
to catch them.

466
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,767
RICHARD:
Thank you.

467
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,268
You need to keep me

468
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:34,603
and I'll provide you
with the fish you need.

469
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,438
SEAN:
I don't what I'd do without
the gay perspective anyway.

470
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,274
(<i> laughs</i> )

471
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:08,386
I don't see it at all.

472
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,431
We heard a rumor
that the other team

473
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,474
caught a fish with their spear.

474
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,310
The mask--
that was definitely the key

475
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:19,439
to them starting to get fish.

476
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:20,816
And that does worry me
a little bit

477
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,983
'cause they're going to be
eating some protein.

478
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,654
I would definitely rather
have fish than rat, but...

479
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,738
now it doesn't matter--
either/or now.

480
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,785
JENNA:
<i>Ho, I'm</i> so<i> ready to eat rat.</i>

481
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,495
I want to gut 'em, bone 'em,

482
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,372
and then we'll have, like,
some little rat meat

483
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:35,956
in with the rice
that we're eating.

484
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,375
That would be delicious.

485
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,337
I'm not sure
what a rat might taste like.

486
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,672
Nobody's said anything to me
about what it could taste like.

487
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,550
GERVASE:
<i>Anytime anybody can hit one</i>

488
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,510
over the head, we're hitting
them over the head, too.

489
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,679
Gretchen hit one
the other night--

490
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,514
<i>last night--</i>
<i>with the soup spoon.</i>

491
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,391
GREG:
This is not
an easy sport.

492
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,433
Oh, no.

493
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,770
(<i> laughing</i> ):
That's me!

494
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,730
The principle of the trap:

495
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:06,069
This noose is wrapped around
the inside of this area here.

496
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,071
The bait's in there

497
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,740
and it's getting tugged out
by the rat...

498
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,786
and the noose goes tight.

499
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,507
JOEL:
<i>So here's our plan</i>
<i>with the rats.</i>

500
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,925
We're going to
chop the head off

501
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,428
take the guts out,
take the skin off,

502
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:34,389
cut the feet off,
and pull the skin
off that way...

503
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:36,141
throw a few minnows in there,

504
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,017
surf and turf;
minnows and rats.

505
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,227
(<i> laughing</i> ):
All right!

506
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,061
I'm telling you guys

507
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,855
we're not going
to want to go home.

508
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,106
We're set.

509
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,900
Bring 'em on, baby.
Bring 'em on.

510
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,591
GREG:
<i>Rats aren't bad.</i>
<i>Rats are rats.</i>

511
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:10,592
Questions of edibility

512
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,093
only have to do
with your perceptions.

513
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,442
GERVASE:
Smells good.

514
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,915
Oh, yeah. We're stylin'.

515
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,291

00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,001
RAMONA:
Uh, what does
it taste like?

517
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:45,669
I'm not sure.

518
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:48,088
Rat?

519
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:48,922
Tastes like rat.

520
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,632
Almost like chicken,
a little bit.

521
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,801
Use your imagination.

522
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,844
Am I using<i> a lot</i>
<i>of imagination?</i>

523
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:55,804
Don't smell it.

524
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,931
<i>Don't</i> smell it?

525
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,474
No.

526
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,601
I'm concerned
that it'll be a bit gamy.

527
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,812
We won't have quite the gravy
we're looking for,

528
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:04,813
which would really be helpful.

529
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,315
Uh, when cooking rats

530
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,858
<i>I would imagine the sauce</i>
<i>is of the utmost importance.</i>

531
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:14,197
As poor as we get in the ghetto,
we don't ever eat the rats.

532
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,324
Ever.

533
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,909

are missing something.

537
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,672

542
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:03,538

545
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:11,212

546
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,213
Oh, yeah.

547
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,883
We's about the grub.

548
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,344
Joel, can you pass the rat?

549
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,720
Please?

550
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,430
Why you hogging
the rat, Joel?

551
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,098
Now everybody's taking my rat.

552
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,852
They're really, really good.

553
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,854
GERVASE:
<i>There's plenty of food</i>
<i>on the island.</i>

554
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,606
<i>You won't starve</i>
<i>with all these rats.</i>

555
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,983
There's tons of them
and they're everywhere, so...

556
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,027
there's definitely stuff
to eat out here.

557
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,778
I think people
would just rather eat

558
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,322
some fish instead, that's all.

559
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:47,916
We've got a clue.

560
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,209

That would be Kelly.

567
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,892
We probably have to carry her,

568
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,602
or something, somewhere--
a race.

569
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,604
Through the woods.
Right, right.

00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,648
RICHARD:
<i>Today's immunity challenge day</i>

571
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,566
so we're building a, uh...
stretcher.

572
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,068
Got to be a strong one.

573
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:15,944
We don't know for what
but, uh...

574
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,779
obviously, it's a competition

575
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:21,950
that's going to determine
who kicks somebody out tonight.

576
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,785
RICHARD:
We got our mission,
Rudy.

577
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,246
Looks like we got to build
a stretcher.

578

Bamboo... bamboo...

a brace there.

581
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,466
All right, set it
up right there.

00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:46,141

00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,478
for one, you win the immunity.

00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,354
You don't have to go
through worrying

586
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,606
about kicking somebody
off your team.

587
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,692
STACEY:
<i>In general,</i>
<i>we're a really tight group.</i>

588
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,193
We all have
our individual strengths

589
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,778
and we're pulling together,

590
00:28:58,862 --> 00:28:59,988
it's just, if we could
get Rudy out of here

591
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:03,283
<i>I think we'd be even stronger.</i>

592
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,659
It's going to
have to be rope,

593
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:05,493
not that little
stuff we got.

594
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:09,164
No, we got three rolls
of the rope, Rudy.

595
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,335
It's hanging there.

596
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,044
Why don't you
just tie the rope?

597
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,505

598
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,590

599
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:19,841

We have some idea.

619

It's going to involve
the stretcher

620
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,016
and an evacuation--
an emergency-type thing.

621
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,186
We got to win, guys.

622
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:14,896
We're feeling
a little bit defensive,

623
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,773
but we're also feeling
like we can do it.

Good job.

Hey, guys.
Welcome to Larai Larai Beach.

635
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,106
Another immunity challenge.

636
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:01,401
You guys got a note
asking to build a stretcher.

637
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,319
You were also asked
to pick one member.

638
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,445
An hour ago,
we took those two people

639
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:08,074
and placed them in a secret
location in the jungle.

640
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:10,702
This is an immunity challenge.

641
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,620
You know what that means,
but let me spell it out:

642
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,330
The losers are going
to the Tribal Council

643
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,456
where you have to vote off
another member.

644
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,458
All right, for the scenario,
I just need one leader

645
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,502
from each team
to come up here.

646
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,504
I'll take that immunity idol.

647
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,089
That's fair game again.

648
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,465
For today's scenario

649
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,593
imagine there's
been a plane wreck--

650
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:27,594
this plane right here.

651
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,804
On that plane was one
of your tribe members.

652
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:31,264
The good news is they're okay.

653
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,473
They had a parachute on.

654
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,017
The bad news is they are stuck

655
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,561
<i>up in this jungle,</i>
<i>hanging from a tree.</i>

656
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,187
<i>Your job is to take</i>
<i>your stretcher,</i>

657
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:41,316
get up here to where they are
and get them back down.

658
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,484
They are equal distance
from the beach

659
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,194
so everything is fair.

660
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,779
Once you get back down here

661
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:47,655
it's a sprint from here

662
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,657
all the way down
to our first aid tent.

663
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,034
You have to have all six people

664
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,201
with one hand on the stretcher.

665
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:55,371
You guys ready?

666
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,290

00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,876

00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,387
Here we go.
I'm here.

696
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,514
Quick, get underneath her!

697
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:55,556
Stand up tall!

698
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,475
Good! She's down!

699
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:58,518
You got to get me.

700
00:32:58,601 --> 00:32:59,769
Got her.
Get it off.

701
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:00,937
You guys have to carry me.

702
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,065
Let's go.

703
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,066
Take it.

704
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,235
You got the flag?

705
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,736
Yeah.

706
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,862
If it gets in
the way, drop it.

707
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,580
We got her,
we got her.

708
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,123
Keep going, guys.

709
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,249
We got this one.

710
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,418
Hold onto me.

Tagi, Tribal
Council tonight.

723
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,094
I know that's going to
be a tough decision

724
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,929
who you guys are
going to vote off.

725
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,514
You got the afternoon
to think about it,

726
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,433
and I'll see you at
the council tonight.

727

We just got to get some fish
to keep our strength up.

729
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,273
Yeah.

730
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:28,357
I don't want to
do this tonight.

731
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,902
This is the worst one.

732
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:31,861
Yo, guys, the good news
about winning:

733
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:34,155
we have a little victory walk
planned for you.

734
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,823
I don't know if you've been
to Bird Island yet--

735
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,325
it is beautiful--

736
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,494
and there awaits, hanging
in the tree like Colleen,

00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,953

<i>Since we lost</i>

00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:33,381
we go back to the council
tonight-- fun, fun.

743
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,716
Well, having lost the challenge,

744
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,968
we've got to vote
somebody out again.

745
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,846
That's what happens every time
we lose an immunity challenge.

You know,
every time we go there

749
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,564

to suck even more.

<i>I was going to vote for Rudy.</i>

<i>But I was thinking about</i>
<i>voting for her</i>

<i>'cause she was the weakest.</i>

770
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,107
I got to think of the team;
that's what I'm here for.

<i>I've kind of prioritized people</i>

772
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:40,156
based on who's contributing,
I think,

00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,365
<i>and can contribute most</i>
<i>to the competitions.</i>

<i>and the people that</i>

Take a seat.

791
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,515
I thought about
you earlier;

792
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,058
making the long
walk from your camp

793
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,643
to the middle of the jungle,

794
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,186
to Tribal Council
on what has been

795
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:54,981
one of the weirdest weather days
we've had so far.

796
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,565
20 minutes ago,
it was as hot
as it's ever been

797
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,527
and now we have
as big a storm
as we've seen.

798
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,697
Going to try a couple of things
differently tonight.

799
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,323
One is this conch shell--

800
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,033
the whole idea being
to see if we can get

801
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:06,951
to a little
more truth.

802
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:09,078
You ought to be
able to feel safe,

803
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,872
to say things here
that maybe you can't
say back at camp.

804
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,542
So, is there anybody here that
has something on their mind?

805
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,377
Have at it,
Richard.

806
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,503
Keep me. I'm
getting the fish.

00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:22,133

don't vote me out.

JEFF:
Fair enough.

810
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,760
Sean, you and
Dirk went out,

811
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:27,388
tried to catch fish
for a few days.

812
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:27,930
Went out again today.

813
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,765
Went out
again today.

814
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,392
Do you feel, even though
you're putting forth the effort,

815
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,228
do you feel a bit threatened
by the fact that

816
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:35,396
when it comes
to assessing people's worth

817
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,690
Richard did deliver
and you haven't

818
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,191
been able to
catch any fish,

819
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,151
or is that just
one aspect?

820
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:43,237
No, I don't think so
right now, at this point,

821
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:43,821
but I think that Richard
catching fish

822
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:44,739
is great for the group,

823
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,615
and I'm pretty comfortable
with my position.

824
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,326
I'm somewhat entertaining,
sometimes.

825
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,620
I make people laugh,
and I'm keeping people healthy

826
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,748
and, uh, so I'm comfortable
with my role--

827
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,249
fishless or fishworthy.

828
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:56,751
Susan, you've been

829
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:57,460
quiet tonight.

830
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,920
What are you thinking right now?

831
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:03,716
I'm thinking right now that,
um, the elimination...

832
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:07,261
the way we vote is
because of the... competition--

833
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:10,389
it's like Rich getting fish
for the group.

834
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,891
That's not coming
into foreplay yet

835
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,768
'cause we're not starving
to death yet.

836
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:17,980
Maybe by day 20, we'll be, like,
yeah, he can catch fish,

837
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,273
he's staying
around,

838
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:20,983
<i>you know, but, uh...</i>

839
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,777
All right, it's raining too hard

840
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,737
to put you guys through this
any longer.

841
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,239
Anybody want to
say anything at all
in this downpour?

842
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,741
Stacey, the
floor is yours.

843
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:29,992
Yeah, you guys,

844
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,994
I daresay I was happy
to eat the bugs

845
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:32,661
that kept us out of here

846
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,663
last time,

847
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:37,917
and the games coming up are
my real strong point, so...

848
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,252
JEFF:
All right, guys.

849
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,796
You got to
survive the vote

850
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,214
to keep going on.

851
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,424
So, Sean, start us off.

852
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:51,180
It's going to be a downpour,
buddy. Write clearly.

853
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,441
I'm voting for Stacey.

854
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,276
Um, nothing personal.

855
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,654
I just feel that we need
as much athleticism

856
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,447
and brute force
in this competition.

857
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,824
I love her to death

858
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,743
and this is no reflection
on the type of person she is.

859
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,099
Rudy.

860
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,192
I'll make this quick, guys.

861
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,736
I'll tally the votes.

862
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,083
Once the votes
are tallied

863
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,585
the decision
is final

864
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:45,878
and the person
voted off

865
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,922
will need to
leave the island
immediately.

866
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,381
The good news is

867
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,050
you'll soon be drier.

868
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,468
With that, I will, uh...

869
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:53,677
read the names.

870
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,768
First vote...

871
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,728
"Stacey."

872
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,985
Next vote, fading,

873
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,528
"Rudy."

874
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:17,534
"Stacey."

875
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,125
"Rudy."

876
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,294
That's two
votes for Rudy,

877
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,630
two votes
for Stacey.

878
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,260
"Stacey."

879
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,016
"Stacey."

880
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,686
That's four
votes, Stacey.

881
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:46,021
That's a majority.

882
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,982
We don't need to
read the last one.

883
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,192
STACEY:
All right,
you switched your vote.

884
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,068
JEFF:
You need to bring
me your torch

885
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:53,028
if you would, please.
Thank you.

886
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,073
Thanks.

887
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,204
Well, the weather
has spoken

888
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,998
and the tribe
has spoken.

889
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:04,665
Okay.

890
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,875
It's time for you to go.

891
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,460
Yeah.way?

892
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:08,919
Good-bye..

893
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:13,966
As for you guys,

894
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:16,719
I don't want to send
you back out in that.

895
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,804
You're welcome
to stay here tonight,

896
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,514
or until it stops raining...

897
00:43:20,597 --> 00:43:22,391
as dry as you can,

898
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,810
and, uh, I'll see you
at some point tomorrow.

899

00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:32,234

903
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:55,883
Last night was the worst night
I've ever slept.

904
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,384
<i>I don't want to sleep</i>
<i>in that anymore.</i>

905
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,385
I'm going in the woods.

906
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,386
I had this vision.

907
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,096
I thought I'd build
myself a bowling alley.

908
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,473
We don't need a bowling alley.

909
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,350
RICHARD:
<i>I know what the resolution</i>

910
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,852
<i>to the conflict would be,</i>
<i>but I'm planning something</i>
<i>different</i>

911
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:09,730
and it's a little sneaky.

920
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,544
<i>And that would be me.</i>

921
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,755
And yet I was much more
productive than the four guys.
