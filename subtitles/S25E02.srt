1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:03,586
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,212
"SURVIVOR": 15 AMERICANS WERE

3
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:06,089
SHIPPED TO THE PHILIPPINES, AN

4
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:09,050
ISLAND NATION FULL OF DEADLY

5
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,386
ANIMALS AND FEROCIOUS STORMS.

6
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:13,221
AMONGST THE NEW SURVIVORS WERE

7
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:13,638
TWO FAMILIAR FACES--

8
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:16,307
MY NAME IS LISA WELCHEL.

9
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,143
I PLAYED THE CHARACTER BLAIR

10
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:19,144
WARNER ON "THE FACTS OF LIFE."

11
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:21,521
I'M JEFF KENT.

12
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:23,148
I PLAYED 17 YEARS IN MAJOR

13
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,107
LEAGUE BASEBALL.

14
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,734
THIS WILL BE REAL FUN FOR ME.

15
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,694
Jeff: THE NEW CASTAWAYS

16
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,112
WERE JOINED BY THREE PAST

17
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,989
SURVIVORS, ALL RETURNING FROM

18
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:31,781
DEVASTATING EVACUATIONS.

19
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,658
ALL THREE HAVE ONE THING NONE OF

20
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,785
THE REST OF YOU HAVE--

21
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:36,119
EXPERIENCE.

22
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:39,289
THIS SEASON, THE CASTAWAYS WERE

23
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,832
DIVIDED INTO THREE TRIBES, EACH

24
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:44,461
JOINED BY ONE RETURN PLAYER.

25
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,547
JONATHAN PENNER JOINED KALABAW.

26
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,217
MICHAEL SKUPIN TO TANDANG.

27
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:54,053
AND RUSSELL SWAN TO MASTING.

28
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,014
EITHER THESE PEOPLE WILL RUN

29
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,515
WITH ME OR I'M GOING TO HAVE TO

30
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,391
RUN THEM OVER.

31
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:02,145
Jeff: YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

32
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,188
CUT IT!

33
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,856
CUT IT!

34
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,566
IS YOUR LEG OKAY, BUDDY?

35
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,026
WITHIN THE FIRST THREE

36
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,235
MINUTES I POSSIBLY COULD HAVE

37
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,321
TORN MY M.C.L., AND IF MY

38
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,114
TEAMMATES SMELL BLOOD THEY'LL

39
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:16,534
KICK ME OFF THIS ISLAND REAL

40
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:16,826
FAST.

41
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,243
Jeff: IT WAS CLEAR

42
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,120
EXPERIENCE WAS KEY WHENEROUS

43
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,957
EXPEL PENNER FOUND CLUES TO THE

44
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,501
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOLS.

45
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,003
FOUND THE CLUE!

46
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:28,505
Jeff: BUT FOR PENNER IT

47
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,088
WASN'T ALL LUCK.

48
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,423
I AGREE.

49
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,468
I THINK HE HAD HIS TIME AND

50
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,427
HE'S OUT AS SOON AS WE CAN GET

51
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,386
HIM OUT.

52
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:40,183
Jeff: AT TANDANG,

53
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,101
ABPIERKS AND R.C. WERE ALL

54
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:42,352
SMILES.

55
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,937
THEY JOINED A MAJORITY ALLIANCE

56
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,563
OF FOUR, MAKING LISA, THE FORMER

57
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,773
TEEN STAR, AN EARLY TARGET.

58
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,315
I DO NOT TRUST HER.

59
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:50,360
DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE LISA.

60
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,194
LISA IS WAY FAMOUS.

61
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,530
I DON'T KNOW HER STRATEGY FOR

62
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,989
NOT REVEALING WHO SHE IS.

63
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,783
Jeff: AT THE FIRST IMMUNITY

64
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:57,033
CHALLENGE.

65
00:01:57,116 --> 00:02:00,495
I WANT YOU TWO TO DO THE

66
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:00,703
PUZZLE.

67
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,705
Jeff: RUSSELL'S BOSSINESS

68
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:02,956
BACKFIRED.

69
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,541
KEEP GOING!

70
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,000
KEEP GOING!

71
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,044
DON'T LOOK!

72
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:10,213
Jeff: KALABAW FIRST TO

73
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,048
FINISH.

74
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:13,842
TANDANG SURVIVES IMMUNITY AS

75
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:14,050
WELL.

76
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:16,010
I TOLD YOU I'M NOT GOOD AT

77
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:16,219
PUZZLE.

78
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,303
BACK AT CAMP, ALL EYES ORP

79
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:17,554
RUSSELL.

80
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,348
HONESTLY, I CAN'T STAND

81
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:20,557
RUSSELL.

82
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,933
HE'S GOING HOME.

83
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,644
Jeff: UNTIL ZANE SHIFTED

84
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:25,228
THE BLAME TO HIMSELF.

85
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,522
THREE DAYS IN, BROTHER, I

86
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:27,939
AIN'T BUILT FOR IT.

87
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,190
NOTHING AGAINST ZANE, BUT

88
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,358
THIS IS NOT THE POINT IN THE

89
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,443
GAME WHERE YOU CAN HAVE WEAK

90
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:32,694
PLAYERS.

91
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:36,239
Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

92
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,490
THEY CALLED OUT RUSSELL.

93
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,409
HE TOLD ME, IF WE LOSE, IT'S

94
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:39,701
YOUR FAULT.

95
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,661
Jeff: IN THEIND.

96
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,454
I HAVE SO MUCH MORE TO GIVE.

97
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,248
AND HOPE I GET THAT

98
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,877
OPPORTUNITY G.

99
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,170
Jeff: RUSSELL BARELY

100
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:51,421
ESCAPED.

101
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,380
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

102
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:53,214
17 ARE LEFT.

103
00:02:53,298 --> 00:03:05,643
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

104
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,521
WHY?

105
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,319
WE WENT TO TRIBAL TONIGHT.

106
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,654
I KNEW MY HEAD WAS POTENTIALLY

107
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,781
ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.

108
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,200
I GOT INTO THIS KIND OF TRIBAL

109
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,285
CHIEF THING WHERE IT WAS MY WAY

110
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,286
OR THE HIGHWAY.

111
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,914
AND IT ALMOST GOT ME VOTED OUT.

112
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,373
LET'S JUST NOT DO THAT AGAIN.

113
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:27,749
HOW ABOUT THAT.

114
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,334
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

115
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,753
SO, MY STRATEGY GOING FORWARD

116
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,546
IS TO STEP BACK AND LET THEM

117
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,464
RISE AND FALL ON THE DECISIONS

118
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,465
THAT THEY MAKE.

119
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,384
THAT WAY, IF WE CRASH AND BURN,

120
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,970
THEN THEY CAN BE ON THE CHOPPING

121
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:47,268
BLOCK AS OPPOSED TO ME.

122
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,647
COME OVER HERE.

123
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,314
WHERE ARE YOU?

124
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:57,820
RIGHT HERE.

125
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:03,242
IT IS SO FREAKING COLD.

126
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,244
IF I DID NOT CUDDLE I WOULD HAVE

127
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,037
FROZE TO DEATH.

128
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,038
THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON BETWEEN

129
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:07,205
US.

130
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,289
YOU KNOW, WHEN IT'S COLD, YOU

131
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,918
NEED TO CUDDLE UP TO SOMEONE.

132
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,879
WHEN I FIRST SAW ANGIE, I

133
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,839
KEPT HAVING TO REMIND MYSELF,

134
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,299
DON'T GET BOOTY BLINDED.

135
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,218
DOARNT GET BOOTY BLINDED.

136
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,262
YOU'RE HERE TO PLAY "SURVIVOR"

137
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,972
TO MAKE A MILLION DOLLARS AND GO

138
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:24,180
HOME.

139
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:25,348
THERE'S NO DENYING, THAT'S A

140
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,516
GOOD-LOOKING GIRL.

141
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:33,272
SHHH!

142
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,691
SO I WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF

143
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,317
THE NIGHT, AND MALCOLM AND ANGIE

144
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:40,363
THEY'RE, LIKE, CUDDLING, FULL ON

145
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:40,613
CUDDLING.

146
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,991
IT'S THE SAME TRAP THAT IS SET

147
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,286
EVERY TIME, AND ANGIE LITERALLY,

148
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,330
IT'S A BOOBY TRAP, AND MALCOLM

149
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,374
IS FALLING FOR IT.

150
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,293
I WAS NOT BORN YESTERDAY.

151
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,628
OKAY.

152
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,964
AS A TRIBE, WE NEED TO BE AWARE

153
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,632
THAT THAT IS GOING ON BECAUSE

154
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,009
THOSE TWO ARE DANGEROUS

155
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:01,551
TOGETHER.

156
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,887
ONE HAS GOT TO GO, PERIOD.

157
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:07,932
Captioning brought to you by

158
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,934
Survivor Productions, CBS,

159
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,299
THE WEATHER IS HORRIBLE.

160
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,592
IT'S ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC.

161
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,968
EVERYTHING IS SOAKING WET.

162
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:44,594
AND I WAS, LIKE, NERVOUS ABOUT

163
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,471
THE RICE GETTING MOLDY.

164
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:49,265
SO I STUCK MY HAND IN JUST TO

165
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,850
MAKE SURE, AND I TOOK THE BAG

166
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,310
BEFORE TO FIND EYE CLUE AND I

167
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,978
DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING, AND WHICH

168
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:54,562
TIME I FOUND IT RIGHT AWAY.

169
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:55,980
IT'S GOOD.

170
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,315
DO YOU WANT TO JUSTRAPHY IT

171
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:57,815
HERE FOR NOW?

172
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:58,524
LISA WAS LOOKING OVER MY

173
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,152
SHOULDER SO I WAS HOPING SHE

174
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,612
DIDN'T REALLY SEE MY FACE OR

175
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:09,243
GIVE AWAY ANYTHING.

176
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,419
SOMETIMES I FEEL ABI COULD

177
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,213
POTENTIALLY USE ME IN THE

178
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,839
FUTURE, BUT I FEEL LIKE I CAN

179
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,257
USE HER IN THE FUTURE SO IF I

180
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,552
GET HER ON MY SIDE, SOLIDIFY HER

181
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,846
WITH ME THAT WILL BE THE

182
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:29,889
STRONGEST TWO-SOME AT LEAST IN

183
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:34,102
OUR PRIDE.

184
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,526
I KNEW IT.

185
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,819
WHAT DID I TELL YOU.

186
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,069
I KNEW IT.

187
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,987
IT'S AT CAMP.

188
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:45,488
THIS STAYS BETWEEN US?

189
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:45,905
OF COURSE.

190
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,324
I MEAN, I TRUST PETER AND I

191
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:48,950
TRUST MICHAEL BUT, LIKE, THIS IS

192
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,618
FOR US, FOR THE FUTURE.

193
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:51,661
YEAH, LET'S GET WATER AND

194
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,371
HIDE THIS.

195
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,790
ME AND ABI REALLY CLICKED SINCE

196
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,667
DAY ONE BUT SINCE HE HAVEN'T

197
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,378
BEEN TO GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL OUR

198
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,379
ALLIANCE HASN'T BEEN TEST YET.

199
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,964
I SHARED THE CLUE WITH HER AND

200
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,382
THAT SHOULD BE PROOF ENOUGH THEY

201
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,007
TRUST HER.

202
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,218
HOPEFULLY NONE OF THEM FOUND

203
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:07,510
IT, FIRST.

204
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:07,885
UNDER OUR NOSES.

205
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,637
IT IS GREAT THAT R.C. WANTS

206
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,513
TO SHARE THE IDOL WITH ME.

207
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,558
I WAS VERY LUCKY TO CATCH HER

208
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,476
FINDING THE CLUE, SO SHE HAS NO

209
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,562
OTHER CHOICE.

210
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,481
BUT A SIDE OF ME TELLS ME TO BE

211
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:24,861
CAREFUL.

212
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:26,612
NO.

213
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,282
YEAH, THAT'S NEW.

214
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,450
I JUST DON'T KNOW IF I CAN

215
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,743
TRUST R.C. ALL THE WAY, BECAUSE

216
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,412
I FEEL THAT SHE'S GETTING A

217
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,164
LITTLE BIT TOO CLOSE TO MIKE.

218
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,582
WHAT WERE YOU GUYS TALKING

219
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:37,790
ABOUT?

220
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:41,711
IF YOU WANT TO GET YOUR

221
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,503
CLOTHES OUT OF RAIN.

222
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,464
I CATCH THEM WHISPERING A

223
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,009
LITTLE TOO MUCH, I CATCH THEM

224
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:48,968
SWITCHING CONVERSATIONS WHEN I

225
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,678
WALK IN.

226
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,555
IF SHE SCREWS ME OVER, THAT'S

227
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:52,722
IT.

228
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:57,685
SHE'S DEAD TO ME.

229
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:00,563
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, MIKE IS

230
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,315
LIKE MY FATHER.

231
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,608
I LIKE MIKE, BUT THE PLAN IS

232
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,317
STILL IN EFFECT.

233
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,152
THIS IS A GAME.

234
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:06,319
YOU.

235
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:06,944
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU LIKE

236
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,404
MIKE OR NOT.

237
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:09,113
YOU'RE PLAYING A GAME.

238
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,490
YOU AND HIM GO OFF TOGETHER AND

239
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,658
YOU'RE ALWAYS WHISPERING.

240
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:13,618
YEAH, BUT I FEEL THE SAME WAY

241
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,744
ABOUT YOU AND PETE.

242
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,913
BUT WE DON'T SWITCH

243
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,914
CONVERSATIONS WHEN PEOPLE WALK

244
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:18,623
UP TO US.

245
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,166
YOU AND MIKE DO, AND IT'S

246
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:20,416
OBVIOUS.

247
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:22,877
I DON'T THINK WE DO.

248
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,504
I THOUGHT ABI WAS MY NUMBER TWO.

249
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,881
I THOUGHT SHE COULD HANDLE IT

250
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,758
BUT SHE CAN GO OFF LIKE THAT AND

251
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,092
THAT REALLY MAKES ME NERVOUS.

252
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,720
SHE THINKS I COULD BE MAKING

253
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:33,596
SUBALLIANCES AND I'M NOT.

254
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,847
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PROVE THAT

255
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:35,473
TO HER.

256
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,474
I WOULDN'T LIE TO YOU.

257
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,683
I HAVEN'T LIED TO YOU, AND YOU

258
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,227
HAVE NO REASON TO THINK THAT I

259
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:39,769
WOULD LIE TO YOU.

260
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,354
I AM YOUR FRIEND.

261
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,021
ME, TOO.

262
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:42,647
BUT IF YOU ( BLEEP ) WITH ME

263
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,524
YOU'RE DEAD.

264
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,983
SERIOUSLY, ARE YOU DONE.

265
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,027
JUST LETTING YOU KNOW.

266
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,667
I'M STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT

267
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,127
WITH THIS WEATHER, BUT I PLAYED

268
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,213
BASEBALL FOR 17 YEARS AND, YOU

269
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,714
KNOW, "SURVIVOR" IS GOING TO BE

270
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,757
A LONG SEASON FOR ME.

271
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,717
I'M UP TO THE CHALLENGE.

272
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,802
I KNOW HOW TO WAIT PEOPLE OUT.

273
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,137
BASEBALL WE PLAYED FOR SIX

274
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:15,346
MONTHS.

275
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,639
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING LEFT

276
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,807
IN THE TANK OCTOBER, THEN YOU'RE

277
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,766
NOT GOING TO BE A CHAMPION.

278
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,686
MAYBE WE SHOULD PLAY INSIDE

279
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,813
GAMES LIKE ON A RAINY DAY AT

280
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:23,980
HOME.

281
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,648
WE COULD DRAW SOME SQUARES IN

282
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,941
THE GROUND.

283
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:27,733
AND ROCKS.

284
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:28,651
AND A CHECKERBOARD.

285
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,028
YOU GUYS WANT TO DO THAT?

286
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:31,737
THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING WITH

287
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,156
MY KNEE SITTING AROUND WATCHING

288
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,533
THE RAIN FALL COULD BE GOOD FOR

289
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:36,117
ME RIGHT NOW.

290
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,618
I'M MAKING SURE I TAKE CARE OF

291
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,079
MY KNEE AND HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY

292
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:40,997
SO OUR TEAM CAN WIN.

293
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,290
HOW MANY SQUARES ACROSS?

294
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:42,456
17.

295
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,791
WHAT ARE YOU DRAWING?

296
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:44,709
WE'RE MAKING A CHECKERBOARD.

297
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,753
AWESOME.

298
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,424
BETTER HURRY UP BEFORE THE

299
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,717
RAIN WASHES THE GAME AWAY.

300
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,053
THE DOWNSIDE IN THE CONSTANT

301
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:56,929
RAIN, THE IDOL IS SOMEWHERE

302
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,222
RIGHT IN OUR CAMP AND I CAN'T

303
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,640
GET THEM OUT OF THE SHELTER.

304
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,643
I NEED 10 MINUTES JUST SO I CAN

305
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,395
DIG AROUND AND GET THIS DAMN

306
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:04,603
IDOL.

307
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,188
IT'S THERE, IT'S WAITING FOR ME.

308
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,817
I CAN'T GET TO IT!

309
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,236
JONATHAN, WHAT DO YOU THINK

310
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:12,528
ABOUT THIS?

311
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:15,156
THIS RAIN?

312
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,284
NO, NO, I'M OKAY.

313
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,786
THE CAVE?

314
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,205
I CAN GRAB A LITTLE TINDER AND

315
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:23,581
GO THERE.

316
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:23,998
I'M GO WITH YOU.

317
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,000
I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO GO FOR

318
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,335
A DIP.

319
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,045
I'M SOAKED ANYWAY, I DON'T CARE.

320
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,212
WE'RE GOING TO THE CAVE.

321
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,756
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A FIRE.

322
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,048
BE CAREFUL!

323
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,300
HAVE FUN!

324
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:34,759
YOU, TOO, SWEETHEART.

325
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,261
BYE.

326
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:37,928
LUCKILY, THEY'RE SO CONCERNED

327
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,514
ABOUT THE RAIN, THEY'VE ALL GONE

328
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:40,890
TO A CAVE.

329
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:45,728
THE CAMP IS EMPTY.

330
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:46,812
THE CLUE SAID IT WAS RIGHT UNDER

331
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,522
MY NOSE.

332
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,899
IT'S RIGHT UNDER MY NOSE.

333
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:55,738
WASTE, OUR TIME, GUYS, UNLESS

334
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,782
YOU GOT ANYTHING UP THERE,

335
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:58,032
CARTER.

336
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:01,660
WHERE THE HELL IS THE DAMN

337
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,871
IDOL?

338
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:07,208
COME ON, MAN.

339
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,751
WELL, FLINT WILL WORK

340
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,419
REGARDLESS HOW WET IT IS.

341
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,046
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

342
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,923
I NEVER HAD THE IMMUNITY

343
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:14,965
IDOL.

344
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,425
I'VE NEVER HAD INDIVIDUAL

345
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:16,884
IMMUNITY AT ALL.

346
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,135
THIS IS A KEY TO THE GAME.

347
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,387
I'VE GOT TO FIND THIS THING

348
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,180
BEFORE THEY GET BACK TO CAMP.

349
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:21,764
AND I'M SAYING JUST STAY CALM.

350
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:28,270
WHO KNOWS HOW LONG YOU HAVE

351
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,480
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

352
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,148
MY LENS WASHED OUT.

353
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,817
I WAS LOOKING FOR MY GLASSES, I

354
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,235
COULDN'T FIND THEM.

355
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,236
YOU FOUND THEM?

356
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,363
YEAH, IT WAS SO WET I LOOKED

357
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,866
UP AND MY LENS WASHED RIGHT OUT.

358
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,326
DAWSON COMES INTO THE CAMP SO I

359
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,786
MADE UP THIS INSANE STORY I LOST

360
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,247
MY GLASSES AND HAD TO GO UNDER

361
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,748
TO GET THEM BECAUSE THE RAIN

362
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,792
WASHED MY CONTACT LENS OUT,

363
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,710
WHICH WAS RIDICULOUS.

364
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:56,006
A LIE.

365
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,219
I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE.

366
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,512
IT'S RIGHT UNDER MY NOSE.

367
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,472
IT'S GOT TO BE THERE, IN THE

368
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,515
CAMP, UNDER MY NOSE.

369
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,766
I'M GETTING MORE AND MORE

370
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,560
FRUSTRATED, AND THEN A LIGHT

371
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,144
BULB GOES OFF.

372
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,563
IF I HAD OPENED THE CLUE WHERE

373
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,857
THE CLUE WAS, ON TOP OF THE

374
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,859
RICE, THERE'S A LITTLE WOODEN

375
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:22,783
BULL WITH A VERY PROMINENT NOSE.

376
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:33,252
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THREE

377
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:37,923
TRIES, I HAVE THE HIDDEN

378
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:38,257
IMMUNITY IDOL.

379
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,425
IT'S FANTASTIC.

380
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:42,678
THE IDOL IS RIGHT UNDER YOUR

381
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:42,845
NOSE.

382
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,181
YOU HAVE THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY

383
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,640
IDOL AND YOU FEEL THAT YOU CAN

384
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,850
DANCE FOREVER, NOT CAN TOUCH

385
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:48,017
YOU.

386
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,768
OF COURSE, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

387
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,604
I KNOW A LOT OF GUYS WHO THOUGHT

388
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:52,688
I'M GOING TO DANCE ALL THE WAY

389
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:55,733
TO THE MILLION AND THEY GOT

390
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:56,025
BLINDSIDED.

391
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,276
THOSE ARE MISTAKES -- WELL,

392
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,736
LISTEN-- THAT'S A MISTAKE THAT

393
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,863
I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE, I HOPE.

394
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,114
YEAH!

395
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,116
I'M ON FIRE!

396
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,340
GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY.

397
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:22,009
GOOD MORNING.

398
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:25,054
SO I WAKE UP ON DAY FIVE, AND

399
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,972
MALCOLM AND ANGIE ARE CUDDLING

400
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:27,181
AGAIN.

401
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:30,851
AND I'M, LIKE, I WANT ONE OF YOU

402
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:31,393
OUT.

403
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,312
MALCOLM IS CLEARLY MORE USEFUL.

404
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:33,979
SO IN ORDER TO GET ANGIE OUT, I

405
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,857
KNEW I HAD TO GET RUSSELL ON MY

406
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:37,983
SIDE.

407
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,528
NOW THE CUDDLING HAPPENING

408
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,195
THEY'RE GETTING CLOSER.

409
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,780
THEY DEFINITELY LOOK LIKE

410
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:43,697
SOMETHING IS GOING ON.

411
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,741
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

412
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,701
( LAUGHTER )

413
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,536
WHERE PEOPLE SLEEP IN THE

414
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,871
SHELTER IS PRETTY TELLING.

415
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,832
AND ANGIE, HOT YOUNG CHICK

416
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,292
WITH-- I MEAN, IT LOOKS LIKE

417
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,878
SHE'S GOT SOME BOOB THING GOING

418
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:58,045
ON.

419
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,505
THEY'RE POPPING UP ALL OVER THE

420
00:13:59,588 --> 00:13:59,713
PLACE.

421
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,132
AND I DON'T BLAME MALCOLM FOR

422
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,926
WANTING TO SLAP AND TICKLE, BUT

423
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,386
I CAN'T GET DOWN WITH THAT.

424
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,430
YOU GET YOUR BANG ON SOMEWHERE

425
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,599
ELSE, BECAUSE "SURVIVOR"

426
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,225
COUPLES, YOU WANT TO WHACK THAT

427
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:14,228
THING DOWN REAL QUICK.

428
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,354
I WOULD HAVE!

429
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,480
NO, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE.

430
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,690
YES, I WOULD HAVE.

431
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,066
ANGE AND MALCOLM ARE A PAIR

432
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,902
AND WHAT'S SCARIER THAN AN

433
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:22,611
ALLIED PAIR.

434
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,613
WHO ARE JUST NATURALLY, I LIKE

435
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,281
YOU, NO MATTER WHAT.

436
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,033
THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME OF

437
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:28,242
THAT.

438
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:31,078
I'M HEARING, LIKE, MOANS AND CUD

439
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,663
KENNEDY LING AND ALL THAT STUFF.

440
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,372
I'M SORRY.

441
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:34,915
THIS IS WHAT I'M THINKING.

442
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,251
IF WE DON'T WIN IMMUNITY, SHE'S

443
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:40,462
GOT TO GO HOME.

444
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,048
THEY SAY MALCOLM AND ANGIE AS

445
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,258
THIS BIG COUPLE, SOME THREAT,

446
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,552
HEY, WE NEED TO SPLIT THAT UP.

447
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,637
BUT MALCOLM AND I ARE IN AN

448
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:48,887
ALLIANCE.

449
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,764
I THINK PART OF IT IS A

450
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:51,765
24-YEAR-OLD GUY SNUGGLING UP TO

451
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:52,391
SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY NICE TO

452
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,101
SNUGGLE UP TO BUT NOW THERE ARE

453
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:59,440
THESE HUGE TARGETS ON THEIR

454
00:14:59,523 --> 00:14:59,732
BACK.

455
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:06,488
THIS MORNING, THERE WAS A

456
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,616
VERY STRANGE VIBE GOING AROUND

457
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:08,824
CAMP.

458
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:09,450
I'M NOT SURE WHAT WAS GOING ON,

459
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:12,202
BUT NOW I'M NERVOUS THE REST OF

460
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,662
THE TRIBE IS FREAKING OUT ABOUT

461
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,248
ME AND ANGIE COUPLING UP.

462
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,292
THEY COULD SEE THAT AS A THREAT

463
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,418
POTENTIALLY, AND IF THAT'S THE

464
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:26,258
CASE, WE COULD BE IN TROUBLE.

465
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:42,399
I JUST SIT HERE AND WAIT AND

466
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:42,733
WAIT.

467
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:43,275
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE FOOD?

468
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,527
HAM AND CHEESE SANDWICH.

469
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,280
I LOVE FRENCH FRIES.

470
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,324
I CAN EAT FRENCH FRIES ALL DAY

471
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:50,532
LONG.

472
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,326
I'M AN INTROVERT BY NATURE,

473
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:55,120
SO I DON'T DO WELL WITH

474
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:55,371
CHIT-CHAT.

475
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,247
I'M JUST NOT VERY GOOD AT THAT.

476
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,625
I'M VERY, VERY SHY, SO IF I'M ON

477
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,127
THE STAGE, I CAN BE BEHIND A

478
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,170
ROLE.

479
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:06,590
BUT IN REAL LIFE, MY TENDENCY IS

480
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:07,174
JUST TO WITHDRAW AND NOT LET

481
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:10,052
ANYBODY IN.

482
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,096
SHE'S GONE.

483
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,056
SHE JUST DISAPPEARS WAY TOO

484
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:14,223
MUCH.

485
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,100
SHE'S OFF LOOKING FOR THE

486
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:16,433
IMMUNITY IDOL.

487
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,102
I FEEL LIKE SINCE WE'RE SO

488
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,895
GOOD ON OUR FIVE THEN, YOU KNOW,

489
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:20,437
WE JUST HAVE TO WATCH HER.

490
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,564
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO WATCH OUT

491
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,399
FOR, NOT THE IDOL.

492
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,024
THAT'S WHY SHE'S LOOKING FOR

493
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,193
THE IDOL RIGHT NOW BECAUSE SHE

494
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:26,402
KNOWS.

495
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,236
I THINK THAT LISA IS A LITTLE

496
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,779
BIT SNEAKY.

497
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,365
SHE'S JUST, LIKE, AN OUTSIDER.

498
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,991
I DON'T FEEL LIKE SHE'S TRYING

499
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,285
HARD ENOUGH TO CONNECT WITH THE

500
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:35,494
TRIBE.

501
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,287
WE CREATED AN ALLIANCE, AND SHE

502
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,831
WASN'T A PART OF IT.

503
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,040
BECAUSE SHE WASN'T CONNECTING

504
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:47,798
WITH ANYBODY ELSE.

505
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,680
I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M FITTING

506
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:54,847
IN.

507
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,098
I'M ALREADY ON THE OUTSIDE AND

508
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,267
DON'T REALLY HAVE SOMEBODY THAT

509
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,438
I CAN TRUST OR TALK TO.

510
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,231
I'VE BEEN ON MY OWN SINCE I WAS

511
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,315
12.

512
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,859
YOU KNOW, WHEN I MOVED TO

513
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,193
CALIFORNIA TO BE ON THE "MICKEY

514
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,238
MOUSE CLUB" AND I LEFT MY

515
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:11,447
FAMILY.

516
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,575
SO I'M VERY USED TO JUST TAKING

517
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,910
CARE OF MYSELF.

518
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,329
SO I THINK IN REAL LIFE I'M

519
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,415
TRYING TO LEARN TO OPEN UP AND

520
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,082
TRUST MORE AND DEPEND ON OTHER

521
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,208
PEOPLE, BUT THIS IS NOT THE

522
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,170
PLACE TO EXPERIMENT WITH THAT.

523
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,672
OBVIOUSLY, SHE DOESN'T HAVE

524
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:28,839
IT.

525
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:29,423
RIGHT, BECAUSE SHE'S STILL

526
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:29,631
LOOKING.

527
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,634
SHE'S LIKE A GOG DOGTHAT

528
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,219
KEEPS ESCAPING THE FENCE IN THE

529
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:34,470
BACKYARD.

530
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,513
EVENTUALLY YOU JUST HAVE TO

531
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,181
SHOOT IT.

532
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,307
I THINK WE'RE ALL IN

533
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,308
AGREEMENT, RIGHT?

534
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,225
OKAY, SHE'S COMING BACK.

535
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:45,397
IT'S HARD BEING ON THE

536
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,690
OUTSIDE, AND, YOU KNOW, I JUST--

537
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,776
MAYBE I'M NOT JUST NOT ABLE TO

538
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:52,321
PLAY THIS GAME.

539
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,963
DOWN, THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT

540
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,339
THING RIGHT NOW.

541
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:14,843
NO FIRE, THAT'S-- THAT'S DEADLY.

542
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,386
THE LAST TIME I PLAYED THIS

543
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,306
GAME, I WENT OUT, THE PLACE WAS

544
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:19,515
RAINING.

545
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,142
I COME BACK IN, IT'S RAINING

546
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:22,351
AGAIN.

547
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,477
SO I GUESS WE'RE JUST GOING TO

548
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,062
BE WET AND MISERABLE AND IT'S

549
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,772
JUST GOING TO SUCK THE B.S..

550
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,232
ARE YOU NOT COLD?

551
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,691
THAT'S WHY I KEEP RUNNING

552
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,652
AROUND, TO KEEP FROM GETTING

553
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:31,860
COLD.

554
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,446
I HAVEN'T BEEN THIS WET IN MY

555
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:34,738
LIFE.

556
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,657
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

557
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,783
IT HASN'T STOPPED RAINING FOR

558
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:38,408
MORE THAN HALF AN HOUR SINCE WE

559
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,911
GOT HERE.

560
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:41,537
RUSSELL'S ON FIRE DUTY AND ME

561
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,872
AND DENISE ARE JUST TRYING TO

562
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:44,456
KEEP THE SHELTER IN ONE PIECE,

563
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,959
AND ROXY IS JUST OUT OF IT IT.

564
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,418
SHE'S NOT WORKING.

565
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,169
HER MIND'S NOT IN IT.

566
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:57,219
AND EVERYONE'S NOTICING IT.

567
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,013
THIS IS CRAZY.

568
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,266
IT'S JUST WATER.

569
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:08,021
WE'RE ALL GOOD.

570
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,523
BEING IN SEMINARY SCHOOL AND

571
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,858
BEING SOMEONE OF CHRISTIAN

572
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,026
FAITH, I THOUGHT THAT WOULD GIVE

573
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,403
ME GREAT STRENGTH WITHIN THIS

574
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:14,570
GAME.

575
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,989
BUT WITH IT BEING SO RAINY AND

576
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:20,158
SO FREEZING COLD, I JUST CAME TO

577
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,869
THE REALIZATION THAT I'M NOT IN

578
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,453
MY COMFORT ZONE AT ALL.

579
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,413
TALK TO ME GIRL.

580
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,205
WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THERE?

581
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,292
DON'T HOLD IT IN.

582
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,711
THERE'S A LOT TO IT.

583
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,088
BUT TRUST ME, WE LOVE YOU.

584
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,381
YOU'RE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS

585
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:34,590
FAMILY.

586
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,216
AND WE NEED YOU.

587
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,427
I HAVEN'T HAD A GOOD NIGHT'S

588
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,678
SLEEP SINCE I'VE GOTTEN HERE,

589
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,555
AND TO BE IN A PLACE WHERE YOU

590
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,474
LITERALLY HAVE NOTHING, NONE OF

591
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,058
YOUR FRIENDS.

592
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,852
YOU HAVE NONE OF YOUR FAMILY.

593
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,730
YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR CHURCH.

594
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:55,611
LIKE, RIGHT NOW, I'M

595
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,904
ENCOUNTERING ALL OVER AGAIN, AND

596
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:57,237
IT'S NOT EASY.

597
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,322
OH, LOOK IT, THE SUN.

598
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,406
YA!

599
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,617
YOU CAN BELIEVE IT?

600
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,576
FINALLY.

601
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,453
THANK YOU, GOD.

602
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:08,665
YOU HEAR EVERY PRAYER, GOD.

603
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:09,249
YOU ARE LOVING.

604
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,252
YOU ARE JUST.

605
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:18,550
GLORY BE TO YOUR NAME, GOD.

606
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,520
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT IF SHE'S

607
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,230
SPEAKING IN TONGUES OR SAYING A

608
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:32,481
PRAYER.

609
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,523
I'M SURPRISED.

610
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,441
I THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE A

611
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,817
LITTLE BIT MORE STRENGTH OF

612
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:36,276
CHARACTER THAN THIS.

613
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,862
IT MAKES ME REALLY NERVOUS,

614
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:39,112
RUSSELL.

615
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:39,488
I KNOW.

616
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,532
ROXY'S, SHE'S PRAYING FOR

617
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,450
SUNSHINE FROM GOD.

618
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,410
IF IT WORKS FOR HER, FANTASTIC.

619
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,204
I'M RESPECTFUL, BUT IT'S JUST

620
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:47,788
NOT MY GIG.

621
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,623
I DON'T PRAY FOR ANYTHING

622
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,707
ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO GET ME

623
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,959
TO THE END OF THE GAME, IT'S

624
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:52,334
GOING TO BE ME.

839
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:20,180
THAT WON'T GO, R.C.

840
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:23,433

00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,294
THERE IS NO 3.

862
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,712
THERE IS A 3 RIGHT HERE.

863
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:53,963
ONE BIG L.

864
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,882
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, HERE WE GO.

865
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:58,051

877
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,571
MATSING GOES TO TRIBAL COUNCIL

00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,588
YOU NOW HAVE TARP AND COMFORT.

884
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:35,880
OH, WOW.

885
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,466
Jeff: GRAB YOUR STUFF.

886
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,551
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

887
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:43,138
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.

888
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,431
KALABAW, COME ON OVER.

889
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,640
IMMUNITY AND A TARP.

890
00:28:45,723 --> 00:28:46,349
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

891
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:46,891
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

892
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,644

RUSSELL, YOU THREW A PIECE OF

894
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,147
THE PUZZLE AT THE END.

895
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,815
WHAT IS THE FRUSTRATION?

896
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,942
I'M PISSED OFF.

897
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,444
I'M SICK OF THIS.

898
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:57,902
I CAN'T DO THIS.

899
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,363
I CAN'T HANDLE THIS.

900
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,950
EITHER GO HARD OR GO HOME.

901
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,743
FORGET THESE OTHER STUPID

902
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,162
TALKING TRIBES.

903
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,538
THEY CAN'T BEAT US.

904
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,665
THEY SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BEAT

905
00:29:10,748 --> 00:29:10,832
US.

906
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,500
Jeff: AND YET THEY HAVE

907
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:12,667
TWICE.

908
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,211
THAT'S BECAUSE THESE FOLKS

909
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,629
HAVEN'T DECIDED THAT THEY ARE

910
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:17,630
UNBEATABLE, THAT THEY CAN DO

911
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:17,839
THIS.

912
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,467
THEY HAVE TO GET THEIR HEADS OUT

913
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,261
OF THEIR BUTT OR GO HOME.

914
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,846
Jeff: SOMEBODY GOING HOME

915
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:25,054
TONIGHT.

916
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,514
I WILL SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL

917
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,724
COUNCIL WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE

918
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:28,308
VOTED OUT OF YOUR TRIBE.

919
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:53,333
AT LEAST WE WERE CLOSE.

920
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,293
CLOSE DOESN'T KEEP US OUT OF

921
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:55,543
TRIBAL.

922
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,462
SO WE GO TO THE CHALLENGE

923
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:00,882
TODAY, AND ONCE AGAIN, WE LOST.

924
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:04,344
20-YEAR-OLD ANGIE, BEAUTY QUEEN,

925
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,137
SHE'S, LIKE, "I DON'T THINK I

926
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,180
CAN DO THIS."

927
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,474
AND THEN HERE'S ROXY SAYING,

928
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,683
"NOT ME.

929
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,394
I HAVE NOT HAD ENOUGH WATER TO

930
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:13,853
DRINK TODAY."

931
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,730
AND I JUST LOST IT.

932
00:30:15,813 --> 00:30:16,898
GUYS, I'M SORRY.

933
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,733
CURSING DOESN'T HELP ANYTHING.

934
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:20,777
THE EMOTIONS WERE RUNNING

935
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:20,985
HIGH.

936
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,571
ROX 18 HAS BEEN EXTREMELY

937
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,365
SUCCESSFUL AT MAKING HERSELF A

938
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,741
TARGET FOR GETTING HER HEAD

939
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:28,743
CHOPPED OFF.

940
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:30,495
BUT I NEED ROXY.

941
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:31,788
EVERY TIME SOMETHING HAPPENS IN

942
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:32,413
CAMP, IF SHE'S AROUND, I KNOW

943
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,373
ABOUT IT.

944
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,083
SHE WAS THE ONE THAT TOLD ME

945
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,709
ABOUT MALCOLM AND ANGIE.

946
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,087
THOSE TWO HAVE LINKED UP, AND

947
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,880
I'M THE ONE WITH THE LARGEST

948
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,966
TARGET ON MY BACK, SO IF ROX 18

949
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:50,181
GOES, I'M, LIKE, SCREWED.

950
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,683
IT'S A PUBLIC EMBARRASSMENT

951
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:52,433
IF YOU ASK ME.

952
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,893
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

953
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,603
GIRLFRIEND'S ON THE FLOOR,

954
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,479
PASSED OUT.

955
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,146
SHE WAS ON THE FLOOR.

956
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:57,605
SHE WAS ON THE FLOOR.

957
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,107
YOU'RE PREACHING TO THE CHOIR

958
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,275
ON THAT, SISTER.

959
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,860
THIS IS WHY COMPANIES DON'T

960
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:03,903
LIKE FLATTERRIZATION.

961
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,989
IT SPOILS A GROUP.

962
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,366
BUT THEY DON'T LISTEN TO ME.

963
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,577
MALCOLM AND ANGIE ARE TOO BUSY

964
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,245
BEING UP EACH OTHER'S BUTT AND

965
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,038
IT'S FRUSTRATING BECAUSE HE

966
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,331
DOESN'T BRING ANYTHING TO THE

967
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:15,540
TEAM.

968
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,166
SHE PLAYS A CHEAP GAME.

969
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,460
I CAN RESPECT PEOPLE WHO DO GOOD

970
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,504
GAMES, WHERE THEY'RE SCHEMING.

971
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,298
THAT ONE OVER THERE WHO DOESN'T

972
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,299
HAVE ANY SKILL AT ALL.

973
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,759
JUST SHOW THE BOOBS.

974
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,970
SOMEBODY WILL FALL FOR IT.

975
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,930
IT'S LIKE MISS AMERICA ALL DAY

976
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,015
LONG, AND IT'S ANNOYING.

977
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:32,974
BOTTOM LINE, ANGIE NEEDS TO GO.

978
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:36,686
NOT JUST BECAUSE SHEETS WEAKEST

979
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:41,482
LINK BUT HER RELATIONSHIP WITH

980
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,692
MALCOLM IS NOT GOOD.

981
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:43,276
SHE SHOULD HAVE WENT FIRST.

982
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,361
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

983
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,946
WE'RE GONNA BE CALLED OUT.

984
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:47,780
FOR WHAT?

985
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,115
SLEEPING SITUATION.

986
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,784
WELL, WHAT'S SHE GONNA SAY?

987
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:52,827
I DON'T KNOW--

988
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,329
WE NEED TO VOTE ANGIE OUT.

989
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,496
THAT'S WHAT SHE'S SAYING.

990
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,205
SHE IS?

991
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,415
WHAT ELSE WOULD SHE SAY?

992
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,625
I'M SURE, YEAH.

993
00:31:58,708 --> 00:31:59,083
IT'S THE ONLY OPTION.

994
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,253
I THOUGHT IT WAS A DONE DEAL

995
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,504
THAT ROXY'S GOING HOME.

996
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,964
THE GIRL IS DOING NOTHING AROUND

997
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,967
CAMP, AND SHE JUST ISN'T HELPFUL

998
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,052
WITH ANYTHING, BUT THE GIRL

999
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,095
STILL HAS A LITTLE FIGHT IN HER.

1000
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,181
SHE CHATTED UP RUSSELL AND FOR A

1001
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,599
GOOD LONG WHILE.

1002
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,559
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE CUDDLING

1003
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:17,769
WITH ANGIE.

1004
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:18,353
BUT IT'S COLD AT NIGHT AND I

1005
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:21,189
SKOOCH OVER AND AN ARM COMES AND

1006
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,191
MAYBE A LEG, AND THEN I'M, "ALL

1007
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,442
RIGHT."

1008
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,694
IT'S ONLY FLESH AND BLOOD.

1009
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,863
A GOOD-LOOKING BLOND GIRL

1010
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:30,198
THROWING THROES HER ARM AND LEG

1011
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,200
OVER ME I'M NOT GOING TO PUSH

1012
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,076
HER AWAY BUT NOW I'M NERVOUS

1013
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:39,832
THAT MIGHT COME BACK TO BITE ME.

1014
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,751
WOW, DID I GET AN EARFUL.

1015
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,586
SHE DOES HAVE A LITTLE

1016
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,170
SURVIVAL INSTINCT.

1017
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,797
SHE HAD PLENTY OF INTERESTING

1018
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,131
THINGS TO SAY.

1019
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,676
MY CONCERN IS ANGIE IS TRYING TO

1020
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:55,139
COME OFF AS THIS SWEET LITTLE

1021
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,140
MISS AMERICA YOU TAW THING.

1022
00:32:56,224 --> 00:33:02,897
BUT ANGIE ISN'T AS INNOCENT A

1023
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,147
PLAYER.

1024
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,565
WHO'S TO SAY WE DON'T LOSE

1025
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,441
ANOTHER DAMN CHALLENGE.

1026
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:08,027
HOW DO I THINK THAT'S GOING TO

1027
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:08,194
CUT?

1028
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,404
SHE CHOPS MY HEAD OFF.

1029
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,738
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

1030
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:16,202
IF ROXAN GOES, I'M NEXT.

1031
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,329
AT THIS POINT, ROXY AND

1032
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:18,955
RUSSELL ARE DEFINITELY ALIGNED,

1033
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,708
AND I KNOW MALCOLM AND ANGIE ARE

1034
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:21,916
ALIGNED.

1035
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:22,583
AND I'M CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF

1036
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,459
ALL THIS.

1037
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:26,003
I CAN'T PUT MY FINGER ON IT, BUT

1038
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:26,587
THERE IS SOMETHING JUST ABOUT

1039
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,382
ROXY THAT I JUST DON'T TRUST.

1040
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,675
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, EVEN

1041
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,969
THOUGH I'VE GOT MY ALLIANCE WITH

1042
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:34,387
MALCOLM, I MEAN, IF SOMEBODY'S

1043
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,930
SNUGGLING AND I'M THE ODD ONE

1044
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:37,140
OUT, I'M ON THE BOTTOM.

1045
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,391
I MEAN, AND I DON'T WANT TO BE

1046
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:39,434
ON THE BOTTOM.

1047
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,102
MAYBE I GIVE MALCOLM TOO MUCH

1048
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,395
CREDIT IN THE SENSE OF PLEASE BE

1049
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,187
A STRATEGIC PLAYER.

1050
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,273
PLEASE DON'T BE BLINDED BY THE

1051
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:45,606
HEADLIGHTS.

1052
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:45,815
PLEASE.

1053
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,984
THE PROBLEM IS, THERE'S PROS AND

1054
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:51,279
CONS TO KEEPING BOTH BUT I'VE

1055
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,822
GOT TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR ME SO

1056
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,365
AGAIN I FEEL PRETTY SURE ABOUT

1057
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,033
WHAT MY VOTE'S GOING TO BE BUT

1058
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:56,909
IT'S A LONG WAY TO TRIBAL

1059
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:57,535
COUNCIL, AND I'LL HAVE TO FIGURE

1060
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:01,330
IT OUT.

1061
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,643
Jeff: SO, RUSSELL, A LOT OF

1062
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,520
EMOTION AT THE END OF THE

1063
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:24,896
CHALLENGE TODAY.

1064
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:27,190
JEFF, I'M INTENSE ABOUT THIS.

1065
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,025
THIS MEANS A LOT.

1066
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,193
I DON'T COME HERE TO JUST

1067
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,277
DILLYDALLY AND BE CUTE AND ALL

1068
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,987
THAT KIND OF STUFF.

1069
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,322
I COME HERE TO KICK BUTT.

1070
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,115
Jeff: DENISE, IT WAS NOT

1071
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:36,949
ONLY BOISTEROUS.

1072
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,285
IT WAS A LITTLE ACCUSATORY.

1073
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,912
"THIS TRIBE NEEDS TO GET IT

1074
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:41,162
TOGETHER."

1075
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,872
IT FELT REALLY ACCUSATORY BUT

1076
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:43,998
AT THE SAME TIME I GET IT.

1077
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:44,874
I DO.

1078
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:46,250
WE'VE BEEN WORKING OUR TAIL OFFS

1079
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:46,793
AROUND CAMP.

1080
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,044
WE WANTED TO BE PREPARED TO GO

1081
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,253
IN AND IT SUCKS.

1082
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,296
Jeff: ROXY, FINISH THIS

1083
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:53,090
SENTENCE FOR ME, "IF THERE'S ONE

1084
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,592
THING I COULD CHANGE ABOUT THIS

1085
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,302
TRIBE IT WOULD BE...."

1086
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:59,764
THAT THEY WON'T INVEST 75% OF

1087
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:02,099
THEIR ENERGY INTO BEING

1088
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:02,809
WORKHORSES AROUND CAMP.

1089
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,101
Jeff: YOU'RE SAYING THEY

1090
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,144
PUT TOO MUCH ENERGY AT CAMP.

1091
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:05,770
ABSOLUTELY.

1092
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:09,273
I FEEL LIKE TO COME BACK AND A

1093
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,191
SECOND CHALLENGE THAT WE LOST

1094
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,151
AND IT'S JUST BACK TO WORK.

1095
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,152
LIKE, THAT'S AWKWARD.

1096
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,237
Jeff: DENISE, YOU'RE

1097
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,446
NODDING YOUR HEAD LIKE THAT

1098
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:15,988
MAKES SENSE.

1099
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:16,322
NO.

1100
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,533
IF WE WANT TO BE STRONG FOR

1101
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:19,700
CHALLENGES, WE NEED TO GET WOOD.

1102
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,326
WE NEED TO GET THAT FIRE GOING.

1103
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,286
WE HAVE TO WORK.

1104
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,413
THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S GOING ON.

1105
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,123
Jeff: ANGIE, FINISH THAT

1106
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:26,666
SAME SENTENCE, "IF I COULD

1107
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:29,168
CHANGE ONE THING ABOUT THIS

1108
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:29,418
TRIBE..."

1109
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:37,635
THAT WE COULD HAVE COOKIES.

1110
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,345
WOW.

1111
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:43,850
Jeff: MALCOLM, ANGIE, FAIR

1112
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,977
ANSWER, SAYS KEEKS WOULD BE

1113
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:46,477
GOOD.

1114
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,355
UH, YOU KNOW, THE STOMACH

1115
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,398
RUMBLING IS SOMETHING WE'RE ALL

1116
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,732
GETTING USED TO SO I CAN

1117
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,984
UNDERSTAND THE KEEK RESPONSE --

1118
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,986
WAIT A SECOND.

1119
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:55,319
REALLY?

1120
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:55,570
REALLY?

1121
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,113
I'M TRYING TO BE NICE.

1122
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,406
Jeff: IN A GAME FOR A

1123
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:01,075
MILLION DOLLARS, ONE OF YOUR

1124
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:02,493
TRIBEMATES SAYS COOKIES WOULD BE

1125
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:02,702
GOOD.

1126
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,829
AND YOU SAY, YEAH, YOU KNOW,

1127
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:05,454
THEY WOULD BE.

1128
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,206
IT'S NOT MY ANSWER BUT IT'S

1129
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,666
BEEN HARD ON THE GIRLS

1130
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:09,500
EMOTIONALLY AND PHYSICALLY.

1131
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,336
I'M NOT SAYING IT'S A PHENOMENAL

1132
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:12,670
ANSWER.

1133
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:13,546
Jeff: RUSSELL, IS THIS WHAT

1134
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:14,797
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, YOU GUYS

1135
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,173
HAVE LOST TWO CHALLENGES IN A

1136
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,217
ROW, AND ONE OF YOUR TRIBE MATES

1137
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:21,012
SAYS IF I COULD CHANGE ANYTHING,

1138
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:21,262
COOKIES.

1139
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,681
I MEAN, JEFF, SHE'S A

1140
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,683
WONDERFUL YOUNG LADY, AND I GIVE

1141
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,768
HER MAD PROPS BUT THIS IS JUST

1142
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:28,394
NEW TO HER.

1143
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,812
SO THE THING IS YOU HAVE TO

1144
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:33,357
LEAVE EVERYTHING OUT THERE EVERY

1145
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:33,608
CHALLENGE.

1146
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,611
AND YOU HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY

1147
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,695
ABOUT ACTION.

1148
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:38,446
Jeff: ROXY, DO YOU SEE

1149
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,907
FRIENDSHIPS STARTING TO FORM IN

1150
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:41,490
THIS LITTLE CLUSTER OF PEOPLE?

1151
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,577
FRIENDSHIPS, ABSOLUTELY.

1152
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,579
OTHER THINGS AS WELL.

1153
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:47,997
I MEAN, I DON'T REALLY KNOW

1154
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,790
WHAT'S GOING ON BETWEEN ANGIE

1155
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,500
AND MALCOLM, BUT IT'S WAY BEYOND

1156
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,044
JUST AN ALLIANCE.

1157
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:53,586
Jeff: BEYOND AN ALLIANCE.

1158
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,755
ABSOLUTELY.

1159
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,381
Jeff: AS IN ROMANCE.

1160
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:01,385
PROBABLY.

1161
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,595
WHAT'S UP?

1162
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:03,304
Jeff: I DIDN'T EVEN SAY

1163
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,805
ANYTHING, MALCOLM.

1164
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:05,723
DID YOU THAT LOOK.

1165
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,850
I ALREADY GOT IT FIGURED OUT.

1166
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:08,434
Jeff: SO IS THERE A LITTLE

1167
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,393
SOMETHING BETWEEN YOU AND ANGIE?

1168
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,021
NO, BUT WE SLEEP NEXT

1169
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,356
TOGETHER AT NIGHT, AND IT GETS

1170
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,608
COLD, SO THERE'S, YOU KNOW,

1171
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,943
MUTUAL WARMTH.

1172
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,569
Jeff: WHAT DO YOU THINK

1173
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,487
ROXY'S PICKING UP ON?

1174
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,655
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ELSE IN

1175
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,199
THE SHELTER IS, UH--

1176
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,659
SNUGGLING.

1177
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:25,993
AS CLOSE AS WE ARE.

1178
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,536
SNUGGLING, THERE'S A GOOD

1179
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,412
WORD FOR IT.

1180
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,748
IT DOES STAND OUT A LITTLE BIT.

1181
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:31,332
IT'S NOT ROMANTIC AT ALL.

1182
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,668
SHE'S LIKE A LITTLE SISTER TO

1183
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:33,834
ME.

1184
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:34,043
REALLY.

1185
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,086
CREEPY.

1186
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,003
Jeff: WHAT WAS THAT ROXY.

1187
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:36,879
CREEPY.

1188
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,673
IF I HAD A BROTHER I WOULDN'T BE

1189
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:39,131
CUDDLING WITH THEM.

1190
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,675
I MEAN, LOOK AT ANGIE.

1191
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,219
THIS IS AN ATTRACTIVE GIRL.

1192
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:43,844
IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT THAT'S

1193
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,304
THE PERSON YOU FEEL LIKE IS YOUR

1194
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,514
LITTLE SISTER.

1195
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:46,681
OKAY.

1196
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,350
Jeff: WHY DOES IT BOTH

1197
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:49,684
BOTHER YOU.

1198
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,353
IT BOTHERED ME ON DAY ONE.

1199
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:57,149
TO ME IT WAS LIKE A BOOBY TRAP--

1200
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,317
SORRY-- LITERALLY.

1201
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:58,609
WHAT, WHAT.

1202
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,319
I'M SORRY THAT I'M COLD.

1203
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:00,903
I'M FREEZING.

1204
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:01,904
YEAH, YOU WERE FREEZING?

1205
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,198
I WOULD CUDDLE WITH YOU,

1206
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:04,365
BUT--

1207
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:04,782
NO, NO, I'M GOOD.

1208
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,242
BUT DON'T.

1209
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,410
YEAH.

1210
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:10,579
Jeff: RUSSELL, TWO PEOPLE,

1211
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,831
EVEN THE APPEARANCE OF BEING

1212
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:14,291
TOGETHER IN A GROUP OF FIVE SOON

1213
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,710
TO BE FOUR, THAT'S HALF THE

1214
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:15,876
TRIBE.

1215
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,336
OH, ABSOLUTE.

1216
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,422
YOU KNOW, AT THE END OF THE DAY,

1217
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,423
RELATIONSHIPS, YOU KNOW, THAT'S

1218
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:23,676
THE TIGHTEST ALLIANCE YOU COULD

1219
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,720
EVER HAVE IN "SURVIVOR."

1220
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,347
Jeff: SO, ANGIE, DO YOU

1221
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:28,723
UNDERSTAND THAT?

1222
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:28,889
I DO.

1223
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,766
Jeff: THE MERE MENTION OF

1224
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,226
BEING WITH SOMEBODY ELSE IS

1225
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:33,978
ENOUGH TO GET YOU VOTED OUT OF

1226
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:34,228
THIS GAME.

1227
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:34,478
UH-HUH.

1228
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,564
Jeff: AND ROXY JUST THREW

1229
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:37,857
THAT CLOUD OF SUSPICION OVER THE

1230
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,442
BOTH OF YOU.

1231
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:40,943
YOU KNOW, THAT'S HER OPINION.

1232
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,361
AND SHE CAN HAVE THAT.

1233
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,697
Jeff: LET'S GET REAL HONEST

1234
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,364
HERE, ANGIE.

1235
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,782
LET'S WAKE UP.

1236
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,659
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.

1237
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,452
THERE'S SUSPICION.

1238
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,787
MALCOLM, YOU'RE UNDER THE SAME

1239
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:52,163
BUS.

1240
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,873
WHAT IF YOU TWO ARE LINKED?

1241
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:56,375
YEAH, IT'S ALL OUT THERE BUT,

1242
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,544
YOU KNOW, I'M TIGHT WHAT A GROUP

1243
00:38:58,627 --> 00:38:59,503
OF PEOPLE AND HOPEFULLY THEY

1244
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,463
UNDERSTAND IT AND THEY'LL TAKE

1245
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,506
IT FOR WHAT IT IS NOT FOR WHAT

1246
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,966
SOMEBODY IS TRYING TO TWIST IT

1247
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:04,175
TO BE.

1248
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,426
YOU KNOW WHAT, JEFF?

1249
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,012
ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS A PAIR IN

1250
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,513
THIS GAME IS VERY DANGEROUS.

1251
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,724
SO IF THERE'S EVEN A 60% CHANCE

1252
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:14,810
THAT THERE'S MORE THERE BETWEEN

1253
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:15,478
ANGIE AND MALCOLM, THEN GOOD

1254
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,772
LUCK TO THE REST OF YOU IF YOU

1255
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:21,650
CHOOSE HER OVER ME.

1256
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,985
Jeff: WITH THAT, IT IS TIME

1257
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,278
TO VOTE.

1258
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:34,205
MALCOLM, YOU'RE UP.

1259
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,584
I HAVE TO CALL A SPADE A

1260
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:38,793
SPADE.

1261
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,127
IF YOU WANT TO PRETEND LIKE IT'S

1262
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,670
SOMETHING ELSE, GO AHEAD.

1263
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:49,762
GOD BLESS YOU AND SHHOM.

1264
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,472
I CAN'T STAND YOU.

1265
00:39:51,555 --> 00:40:02,817
AND I WON'T MISS YOU.

1266
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,323
Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1267
00:40:09,406 --> 00:40:19,416
VOTES.

1268
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,168
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN

1269
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:21,752
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO

1270
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,254
PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME

1271
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:28,134
TO DO SO.

1272
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:28,717
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,

1273
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:29,677
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1274
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,096
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1275
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,889
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1276
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:34,181
IMMEDIATELY.

1277
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,976
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1278
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:42,648
FIRST VOTE, ROXY.

1279
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:42,857
ANGIE.

1280
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,361
ONE VOTE ROXY, ONE VOTE ANGIE.

1281
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:49,697
ROXY.

1282
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,158
THAT'S TWO VOTES ROXY, ONE VOTE

1283
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,326
ANGIE.

1284
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,953
SECOND PERSON VOTED OUT OF

1285
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:58,956
"SURVIVOR: PHILIPPINES," ROXY.

1286
00:40:59,039 --> 00:40:59,290
THAT'S THREE.

1287
00:40:59,373 --> 00:40:59,623
THAT'S ENOUGH.

1288
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:07,381
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1289
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:12,595
ROXY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1290
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:22,605
TIME TO GO.

1291
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,274
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS TOMORROW

1292
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,401
IS ANOTHER DAY AND FORTUNES IN

1293
00:41:27,484 --> 00:41:29,778
THIS GAME CAN CHANGE VERY FAST.

1294
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:30,696
KEEP YOUR HEADS UP.

1295
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:31,071
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

1296
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,573
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1297
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,326
GOOD NIGHT.

1305
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:49,798
Jeff: NEXT TIME ON

1306
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:50,883
"SURVIVOR": 7.

1307
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,259
LISA SCRAMBLES.

1308
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,594
WOULD YOU BE OKAY IF WE HAD

1309
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:54,011
TO GET RID OF MIKE.

1310
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,596
JUST TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

1311
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,682
EVERY DAY I HAVE TO PLAY THE

1312
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,684
HAND I'M LEFT.

1313
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:01,060
RUSSELL SLIDES.

1314
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:03,437
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOD'S

1315
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,980
PLAN FOR ME TO BE HERE.

1316
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,523
Jeff: AND SKUPIN PUTS

1317
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,442
EVERYTHING ON THE LINE.

1318
00:42:08,525 --> 00:42:10,486
SKUPIN BLEEDING FROM THE FACE!

1319
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,658
IT'S BEEN SIX DAYS, BUT IT'S

1320
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:16,951
BEEN SIX LONG DAYS.

1321
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,327
I THINK THAT THE RELATIONSHIP

1322
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,246
BETWEEN ANGIE AND MALCOLM WILL

1323
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,414
IMPACT THE GAME OF DENISE AND

1324
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:22,623
RUSSELL.

1325
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:23,999
AT THIS POINT, THERE'S NO PLACE

1326
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:27,127
TO HIDE, AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

1327
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:27,920
THEM BETTER BE SUPER STAR

1328
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:28,170
OLYMPIANS.

1329
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,463
I HAVE SOME GOOD TIES TO THAT

1330
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,047
GROUP BUT IF THEY BELIEVE THEY

1331
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,131
MADE THE BEST DECISION MAY BE
