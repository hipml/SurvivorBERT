00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:06,124
english from Addic7ed french subtitles: translatesubtitles.com

2
00:01:06,124 --> 00:01:07,264
"The game has begun."

3
00:01:07,264 --> 00:01:09,316
"This may be 
your only night together."

4
00:01:09,316 --> 00:01:12,169
"Help each other and learn 
to make shelter and fire."

5
00:01:12,169 --> 00:01:14,484
"At dawn, follow the path 
on your map."

6
00:01:14,484 --> 00:01:16,596
"Leave the flint and scraper 
behind."

7
00:01:16,596 --> 00:01:18,572
They come from all walks of life.

8
00:01:19,027 --> 00:01:20,022
Oh my God!

9
00:01:20,022 --> 00:01:24,446
As a couple, Jon and Jaclyn already have 
experience of winning.

10
00:01:24,446 --> 00:01:27,042
She is Miss Michigan 2013,

11
00:01:27,042 --> 00:01:28,987
he played football 
for the Michigan team.

12
00:01:28,987 --> 00:01:31,574
Miss Michigan becomes a survivor!

13
00:01:31,574 --> 00:01:32,667
Look at me!

14
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:35,102
- Our relationship is phenomenal. 
- We are having fun.

15
00:01:35,102 --> 00:01:40,813
But it goes beyond 
the beautiful image that people have.

16
00:01:40,813 --> 00:01:42,479
I don't want to be hated

17
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,570
- like a perfect little couple. 
- Yeah.

18
00:01:51,442 --> 00:01:54,449
Former professional baseball 
player, John Rocker

19
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:57,622
created controversy 15 years ago.

20
00:01:57,622 --> 00:01:59,980
I spent 
the last 15 years

21
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,957
trying to say I'm not 
that obnoxious rambunctious guy,

22
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:09,562
but the media loves to portray me as 
a bigoted, homophobic racist.

23
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,981
It's a heavy label.

24
00:02:13,368 --> 00:02:15,314
His longtime companion, Julie,

25
00:02:15,314 --> 00:02:19,396
hope to provide him with the 
necessary support to accomplish a perfect game

26
00:02:19,396 --> 00:02:20,576
and go all the way.

27
00:02:20,576 --> 00:02:21,525
I have a lot to prove.

28
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:23,000
We could say:

29
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,469
"Look at her, with her hair, 
her tits and her boyfriend!"

30
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:28,946
But I am very independent, 
I can take care of myself.

31
00:02:28,946 --> 00:02:32,645
- There are a thousand crab holes. 
- I see!

32
00:02:32,645 --> 00:02:35,550
Here is one! Uh, hi!

33
00:02:36,179 --> 00:02:38,424
Snakes don't live 
in holes, right?

34
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:42,468
Baylor, 
we need to start a fire.

35
00:02:42,468 --> 00:02:44,337
Seriously, we're going to run out of light.

36
00:02:52,293 --> 00:02:53,339
Oh my God!

37
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,092
Lord!

38
00:02:56,092 --> 00:03:00,322
Mother and daughter, Missy and Baylor 
know what adversity is.

39
00:03:00,322 --> 00:03:01,362
He comes over here.

40
00:03:01,362 --> 00:03:03,831
Missy's three divorces 
pushed Baylor

41
00:03:03,831 --> 00:03:07,413
to assume the maternal role 
in this complicated relationship.

42
00:03:07,413 --> 00:03:09,410
- Shit! 
- They are five.

43
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,318
Divorces have brought us closer together.

44
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,434
What happens to me affects him, 
and vice versa.

45
00:03:15,434 --> 00:03:20,092
Absolutely. 
The mother-daughter bond is incredible.

46
00:03:20,435 --> 00:03:22,794
He is indestructible. 
Nothing will stop us.

47
00:03:22,794 --> 00:03:24,197
It's impossible.

48
00:03:32,183 --> 00:03:33,154
Go on!

49
00:03:34,038 --> 00:03:35,212
It did not work.

50
00:03:35,997 --> 00:03:37,588
Cut a lock of your hair.

51
00:03:37,971 --> 00:03:40,897
Brothers Drew and Alec, 
from rural Florida,

52
00:03:40,897 --> 00:03:42,957
have always had 
a sibling rivalry.

53
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:47,520
Drew, the youngest, would love 
to beat his brother in the game.

54
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,957
Drew and I have been fighting 
pretty much since I was born.

55
00:03:50,957 --> 00:03:53,639
I hope to prove to him 
that I can beat him at this game.

56
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,256
I would love to see him fight.

57
00:03:55,256 --> 00:03:58,138
- Honestly, I would love to. 
- You'll be in the front row!

58
00:03:59,244 --> 00:04:00,823
It was a team effort, right?

59
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,213
I was holding 
the flint and the scraper, right?

60
00:04:03,213 --> 00:04:04,413
I suppose.

61
00:04:08,432 --> 00:04:09,850
Dad, take a break!

62
00:04:10,576 --> 00:04:12,125
Don't hurt yourself yet!

63
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:15,950
A hard worker, 
Dale has never known anything but the farm.

64
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:19,794
But growing up, her daughter Kelley 
wanted to go her own way.

65
00:04:19,794 --> 00:04:23,811
Of all the teams, we should 
be the fastest at making fire!

66
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:28,918
Our relationship has had its ups 
and downs for 10 years.

67
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:31,391
For 3 or 4 years, 
we didn't speak to each other.

68
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:34,063
I think Survivor 
will help us find each other.

69
00:04:34,063 --> 00:04:38,118
We will share this 
for the rest of our lives.

70
00:04:38,118 --> 00:04:39,547
We're in bad shape!

71
00:04:41,646 --> 00:04:43,405
Damn, a huge crab!

72
00:04:43,405 --> 00:04:44,630
Grab it!

73
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,214
Old Survivor fans 
and couple, Josh and Reed

74
00:04:48,214 --> 00:04:50,164
are performing on Broadway, New York.

75
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,092
You got it!

76
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:56,541
Both think they can 
survive 39 days in this jungle.

77
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,931
- Stir it up! 
- Yeah!

78
00:04:59,317 --> 00:05:00,992
We lost it!

79
00:05:00,992 --> 00:05:02,974
We're both big fans.

80
00:05:02,974 --> 00:05:06,319
- This guy, for Valentine's Day... 
- Here we go!

81
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,006
...offers me flint!

82
00:05:08,006 --> 00:05:09,935
I offered him flint!

83
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:13,280
- Go on! 
- We are comfortable in the open air,

84
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,137
to sleep in the dirt, 
and we are ready for it.

85
00:05:16,137 --> 00:05:18,628
We'll eat you for dinner!

86
00:05:18,628 --> 00:05:21,385
We did it!

87
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:27,364
They have abandoned the comfort 
and safety of their universe.

88
00:05:27,364 --> 00:05:31,109
For 39 days, 
they will be on their own.

89
00:05:31,109 --> 00:05:32,621
It's a bit upside down.

90
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:35,174
- A firefighter lighting a fire! 
- Not bad not bad!

91
00:05:35,174 --> 00:05:39,372
Val, the Boston police officer 
and her firefighter husband Jeremy

92
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,701
have a form 
of professional rivalry,

93
00:05:41,701 --> 00:05:44,038
despite their mad love.

94
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:46,655
I've been trying to participate 
in Survivor for 10 years.

95
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:50,291
I didn't bring her here, 
leaving our girls at home...

96
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,535
- To lose. 
- ...to lose.

97
00:05:51,535 --> 00:05:53,388
We are both here 
to win.

98
00:05:53,388 --> 00:05:56,375
May the best profession win!

99
00:05:58,453 --> 00:06:00,284
So we spend the night here?

100
00:06:00,284 --> 00:06:02,523
Let's start by praying and we will advise.

101
00:06:02,523 --> 00:06:05,291
Sri Lankan twins 
Nadiya and Natalie

102
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:08,081
played aggressively in 
The Amazing Race,

103
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:09,963
and they failed twice.

104
00:06:09,963 --> 00:06:12,529
They now hope to 
go all the way

105
00:06:12,563 --> 00:06:14,029
of their greatest adventure 
yet.

106
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:17,444
- We hope to finally win. 
- The third is the good one!

107
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,308
In The Amazing Race, 
we had everything we needed.

108
00:06:19,308 --> 00:06:22,048
Remove the essential, 
and you have Survivor

109
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,547
Sleepless nights, empty bellies...

110
00:06:24,547 --> 00:06:26,759
Survivor will be much harder 
than The Amazing Race.

111
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,225
Let him take it, Nadiya, relax.

112
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,591
- Shit, you suffocated him! 
- But no!

113
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,729
Nadiya, he was taking!

114
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:36,722
Our bonds are stronger 
than those of anyone here.

115
00:06:36,722 --> 00:06:38,094
I guarantee it.

116
00:06:38,094 --> 00:06:41,674
'Cause we were never apart

117
00:06:41,674 --> 00:06:43,062
more than two weeks.

118
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:44,455
We need help!

119
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,173
I will light a fire before dark.

120
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:53,798
To keep bugs away.

121
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:57,879
Firefighters in Louisiana 
and father and son, Keith and Wes

122
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,269
have the same love 
of their job and the outdoors.

123
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:03,282
Wes, have you lost the scraper yet?

124
00:07:03,282 --> 00:07:04,423
I gave you both.

125
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,621
But when Keith 
is almost retired...

126
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:07,755
You're kidding?

127
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:11,423
...he's not ready 
to hand over to his son Wes just yet.

128
00:07:11,423 --> 00:07:14,289
We lost the flint scraper.

129
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:16,919
I do believe it is him.

130
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:19,480
Stop putting 
stuff in the sand!

131
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,289
It was you who put it.

132
00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:23,706
It's my turn to shine.

133
00:07:23,706 --> 00:07:26,861
- What about my turn? He passed? 
- Your turn is up.

134
00:07:26,861 --> 00:07:29,265
- He passed? 
- It's up to me.

135
00:07:29,265 --> 00:07:33,683
- Your turn. 
- The social aspect, the physical aspect,

136
00:07:33,683 --> 00:07:37,596
- the mental aspect, I have everything. 
- You have the mind of this rock!

137
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:43,320
This will be the ultimate test 
for their relationship.

138
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,615
18 Americans

139
00:07:50,615 --> 00:07:54,777
forced to cooperate while battling 
the elements and each other.

140
00:07:56,945 --> 00:07:59,887
They must learn to adapt 
or they will be eliminated.

141
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:06,119
In the end, only one will win 
the million dollars.

142
00:08:08,034 --> 00:08:11,028
39 days, 
18 people,

143
00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:13,110
1 Survivor!

144
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,387
It's nice!

145
00:08:54,431 --> 00:08:55,717
Let's talk about last night.

146
00:08:55,717 --> 00:08:57,355
You all received flint.

147
00:08:57,355 --> 00:08:59,619
Who managed to make the fire?

148
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,586
A lot of you!

149
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,991
You, at the end, did you make a fire?

150
00:09:05,991 --> 00:09:07,340
- Yeah. 
- What is your name?

151
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:12,213
Were you surprised 
to achieve that, did...?

152
00:09:12,213 --> 00:09:13,861
- Not surprised at all? 
- Nope.

153
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:16,684
In general, people come here 
without having ever tried to make a fire.

154
00:09:16,684 --> 00:09:18,242
Jeff, if we want to do Survivor,

155
00:09:18,242 --> 00:09:20,309
- you have to know how to make a fire. 
- Exact.

156
00:09:21,032 --> 00:09:23,650
You, in military uniform. 
What is your name?

157
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,916
- Wes. 
- Keith. Father and son.

158
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,516
- You didn't make a fire? 
- Nope.

159
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:30,065
I had a problem. 
We lost our scraper.

160
00:09:30,065 --> 00:09:31,604
We lost it.

161
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,694
- We looked for him for an hour. 
- It got off to a bad start.

162
00:09:36,145 --> 00:09:40,289
But we used a rock, 
and it started to work.

163
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,507
Until 
the flint broke in two.

164
00:09:43,657 --> 00:09:46,655
- So... 
- It went downhill.

165
00:09:46,655 --> 00:09:48,914
I happened to use flint.

166
00:09:48,914 --> 00:09:50,662
It's pretty hard to break.

167
00:09:50,662 --> 00:09:51,829
We did it!

168
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,372
Girls, what's your name?

169
00:09:55,372 --> 00:09:56,853
- Natalie et Nadiya. 
- Natalie et Nadiya.

170
00:09:56,853 --> 00:09:57,935
Sisters, obviously.

171
00:09:57,935 --> 00:09:58,737
- Binoculars. 
- Binoculars.

172
00:09:58,737 --> 00:09:59,841
- Binoculars. 
- Yeah.

173
00:09:59,841 --> 00:10:01,391
Looking around you,

174
00:10:01,391 --> 00:10:04,941
which, in your opinion, 
could already be off to a bad start?

175
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:08,367
In The Amazing Race, we learned 
not to trust appearances.

176
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:11,947
It depends on the tests. 
There are so many factors.

177
00:10:11,947 --> 00:10:14,155
This game is so social

178
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,145
everyone has their chance.

179
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,138
Because it's Blood vs. Water,

180
00:10:20,138 --> 00:10:22,988
you will play against your relatives.

181
00:10:22,988 --> 00:10:25,469
It's time to form the tribes.

182
00:10:25,469 --> 00:10:27,172
I felt my stomach knot.

183
00:10:27,172 --> 00:10:30,036
What to say to Natalie 
just before she leaves?

184
00:10:30,036 --> 00:10:34,526
Above all, not knowing how her tribe 
would treat her was heartbreaking.

185
00:10:34,526 --> 00:10:35,971
Let's discover our tribes.

186
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:39,085
Open, and see your colors.

187
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,764
If you have orange, 
your name is Coyopa.

188
00:10:42,764 --> 00:10:45,480
If you have blue, 
your name is Hunahpu.

189
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,066
Say goodbye.

190
00:10:47,668 --> 00:10:49,203
The game is started.

191
00:10:50,155 --> 00:10:51,965
- Me too. 
- Tear it all up!

192
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:59,595
Here we are. 
I will play against my daughter.

193
00:10:59,595 --> 00:11:01,790
It was quite moving, 
it brings us back home.

194
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,666
That's the whole idea of ​​Blood vs. Water.

195
00:11:05,153 --> 00:11:06,883
From the start,

196
00:11:06,883 --> 00:11:09,861
Reed, a minute ago 
you were with your loved one.

197
00:11:09,861 --> 00:11:12,183
Now he is your opponent.

198
00:11:12,183 --> 00:11:16,197
- Let him come! Let's go! 
- Lord!

199
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:17,783
John, how's that for you?

200
00:11:17,783 --> 00:11:22,051
A man wants to protect his wife, 
that's what he's supposed to do, right?

201
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:23,504
On paper, yes.

202
00:11:23,504 --> 00:11:26,962
It's a form of civil war, 
brother against brother.

203
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,136
I watch a lot of sports

204
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:33,524
I'm pretty sure it's 
John Rocker, the Braves pitcher.

205
00:11:34,011 --> 00:11:36,258
And he was a jerk back then.

206
00:11:36,258 --> 00:11:38,180
It might still be the case.

207
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,225
Jeremy, isn't that particularly hard

208
00:11:41,225 --> 00:11:44,559
because you can no 
longer do anything for your wife?

209
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,783
It's the only thing that's hard.

210
00:11:46,783 --> 00:11:47,958
I want to help him.

211
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,562
- I want... She's my wife. 
- I don't need his help.

212
00:11:50,562 --> 00:11:53,144
- But she's strong. 
- I'm going...

213
00:11:53,144 --> 00:11:56,438
- She'll say that, but I'm still her husband. 
- I'm solid, I can handle it.

214
00:11:56,438 --> 00:11:58,197
And I don't need his help.

215
00:11:59,746 --> 00:12:01,942
Looks like she doesn't 
need your protection.

216
00:12:01,942 --> 00:12:03,944
She says that all the time, but...

217
00:12:03,944 --> 00:12:06,131
But what? I do not need it!

218
00:12:06,131 --> 00:12:07,151
- It's over! 
- It's over!

219
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:09,514
- When the game will start. 
- I can handle myself.

220
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:14,238
Well, the game starts now.

221
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:17,751
Ready for your first 
reward event?

222
00:12:17,751 --> 00:12:19,047
Yeah!

223
00:12:20,178 --> 00:12:21,315
This is how it will go.

224
00:12:21,315 --> 00:12:23,999
One member from each tribe

225
00:12:23,999 --> 00:12:27,161
will unravel a rope 
in a wooden cube.

226
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:28,954
Attached to the rope, two rings.

227
00:12:28,954 --> 00:12:31,983
With the first ring 
you will catch a platform

228
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:33,212
and bring her back.

229
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:37,757
You will return to the cube, 
untangle the rest of the rope,

230
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,387
and with the second ring, 
bring back a second platform.

231
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:47,056
The first person to 
take both platforms across the line

232
00:12:47,056 --> 00:12:49,504
wins a reward for his tribe.

233
00:12:49,504 --> 00:12:54,649
We will do paper-rock-scissors 
to see who chooses first.

234
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,955
Let one member of each tribe 
sit in the middle!

235
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:03,459
- Yeah? 
- Yeah.

236
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:05,165
One two three!

237
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,422
The stone breaks the scissors.

238
00:13:08,682 --> 00:13:11,045
Well, Hunahpu, who do you line up?

239
00:13:11,714 --> 00:13:12,752
I can do it.

240
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:14,186
You're sure? Me too.

241
00:13:14,186 --> 00:13:15,496
I should.

242
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:16,847
He looks confident. Go ahead!

243
00:13:16,847 --> 00:13:18,694
- Will it be Jeremy? 
- So be it.

244
00:13:18,694 --> 00:13:20,454
Jeremy, come close to me.

245
00:13:20,454 --> 00:13:22,192
Come on Jeremy!

246
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:23,233
Jeremy!

247
00:13:24,644 --> 00:13:27,400
A perfect opportunity, from the outset,

248
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,374
to be a hero for your tribe, 
to win a nice reward.

249
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:32,053
Want to know your opponent?

250
00:13:32,366 --> 00:13:34,145
I do not care!

251
00:13:35,513 --> 00:13:36,500
Yeah!

252
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,448
This is the first surprise of the game.

253
00:13:38,448 --> 00:13:41,307
You confront your wife.

254
00:13:42,908 --> 00:13:44,468
- Good! 
- Let's go!

255
00:13:44,468 --> 00:13:45,642
This way!

256
00:13:50,126 --> 00:13:54,971
The couple who 
verbally clashed the most

257
00:13:54,971 --> 00:13:57,624
will fight the first battle.

258
00:13:58,174 --> 00:14:00,407
There is more interesting. 
Want to know what's at stake?

259
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,379
- Yes. 
- Sure.

260
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:05,979
Fire, in the form of flint.

261
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:08,229
As well as a bag of beans.

262
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:11,401
Fire and food, 
two essential elements here.

263
00:14:11,401 --> 00:14:13,995
You will bring them back to your camp 
from day one.

264
00:14:13,995 --> 00:14:18,993
The loser of the event 
will be sent to Exile Island.

265
00:14:23,892 --> 00:14:24,750
Oh my God!

266
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,248
You will live there without shelter 
and with very little to eat.

267
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:33,676
Alas, you will be absent from the camp 
in the 1st moments, when

268
00:14:33,676 --> 00:14:38,295
the crucial alliances 
that can carry you in this game.

269
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:42,362
Nevertheless, you will return in time 
for the immunity test.

270
00:14:42,362 --> 00:14:43,480
You are not eliminated.

271
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,608
It's a real test of Blood vs. Water.

272
00:14:45,608 --> 00:14:49,203
The only way to prove 
your worth to your tribe

273
00:14:49,203 --> 00:14:51,234
is to defeat your loved one

274
00:14:51,234 --> 00:14:53,230
and send him into exile.

275
00:14:53,744 --> 00:14:55,160
How do you feel now?

276
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,689
I am here to play. 
Like all of us, right?

277
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,744
It's like that.

278
00:14:59,744 --> 00:15:00,831
You will have it!

279
00:15:01,164 --> 00:15:03,750
We install your belts 
and we start. Let's go!

280
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,787
Good. The winner wins 
the reward for his tribe.

281
00:15:16,787 --> 00:15:18,964
The loser goes to Exile Island.

282
00:15:19,228 --> 00:15:20,740
Jeremy versus Val.

283
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,017
- Husband versus wife. 
- Go Val!

284
00:15:23,017 --> 00:15:25,097
Come on Jeremy!

285
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,426
Survivors, ready?

286
00:15:29,243 --> 00:15:33,521
- Come on Jeremy! 
- Follow the rope wherever it goes!

287
00:15:33,521 --> 00:15:35,919
Go Val! Go Val!

288
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,203
Val go for it!

289
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:39,103
Jeremy fonce!

290
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,417
Lots of adrenaline!

291
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:48,594
- They stand! 
- Yeah, over!

292
00:15:48,594 --> 00:15:50,759
Husband and wife face off!

293
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:53,877
- Keep the rope tight! 
- Go around!

294
00:15:53,877 --> 00:15:57,048
Jeremy has a bit of a lead, 
Val has to get over it.

295
00:15:57,048 --> 00:15:59,983
- You're doing very well! 
- Above!

296
00:15:59,983 --> 00:16:03,395
- Hook your leg! 
- Jeremy has his first ring.

297
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,513
- Give slack! 
- Above!

298
00:16:05,513 --> 00:16:08,740
Val struggles to untangle this rope.

299
00:16:10,698 --> 00:16:12,533
Jeremy is already throwing.

300
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:16,123
But grabbing this platform 
is not that easy!

301
00:16:16,123 --> 00:16:19,712
- Val struggles to climb. 
- Come on, there you are!

302
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:23,918
Exile Island for the loser, 
not a good start in the game!

303
00:16:27,858 --> 00:16:30,012
That's how we do it 
in Survivor!

304
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,826
Val again in the game!

305
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,514
She has her first ring.

306
00:16:34,514 --> 00:16:36,045
There is a game!

307
00:16:36,432 --> 00:16:38,579
Jeremy almost snagged his.

308
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:40,194
Will it work?

309
00:16:40,525 --> 00:16:42,809
Nope! Very close!

310
00:16:44,418 --> 00:16:46,490
- Yeah! 
- Take it easy now.

311
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,141
Val hung up hers.

312
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:51,202
- She's making progress. 
- Shoot it!

313
00:16:51,202 --> 00:16:53,456
He unhooks.

314
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:55,776
Here, here!

315
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:59,262
Jeremy hung up his.

316
00:16:59,712 --> 00:17:01,939
- He's starting to move. 
- You're there!

317
00:17:02,891 --> 00:17:05,222
Jeremy is doing a great job.

318
00:17:06,046 --> 00:17:07,853
Jeremy has his first platform.

319
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:09,884
Hang up and get back to it!

320
00:17:09,884 --> 00:17:12,811
Val, still after 
her first platform.

321
00:17:13,354 --> 00:17:15,859
You need enough rope 
to do this.

322
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:20,131
- Jeremy extends his lead. 
- Come on!

323
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,333
Val, still stuck 
with too little rope.

324
00:17:23,762 --> 00:17:26,458
- Jeremy has his second ring. 
- Yeah!

325
00:17:28,105 --> 00:17:32,709
Val throws her rope like a lasso, 
like in a western!

326
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:41,006
Jeremy is now 
on his 2nd and final platform.

327
00:17:41,536 --> 00:17:42,943
Val hung up hers.

328
00:17:43,216 --> 00:17:44,982
Jeremy hung up his.

329
00:17:45,407 --> 00:17:48,113
Val is in front, Jeremy behind.

330
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,847
Jeremy unhooks.

331
00:17:49,847 --> 00:17:51,525
Val stays in the game.

332
00:17:51,525 --> 00:17:53,911
Well done, Val, get back to it!

333
00:17:53,911 --> 00:17:55,840
Val needs to speed up.

334
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,722
Jeremy is about 
to send his wife into exile.

335
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:02,461
Jeremy snagged 
his second platform.

336
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:05,372
Can he bring her back?

337
00:18:05,372 --> 00:18:06,812
That works.

338
00:18:06,812 --> 00:18:09,174
Val tries to reach for 
her second ring.

339
00:18:09,174 --> 00:18:10,892
Perhaps in vain.

340
00:18:10,892 --> 00:18:12,354
This may be the end.

341
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,062
Jeremy wins 
the award for his tribe!

342
00:18:18,062 --> 00:18:20,684
And sends his wife to the island of Exile!

343
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:33,566
Jeremy, come here!

344
00:18:34,872 --> 00:18:37,009
From the outset, a big effort.

345
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:40,187
You have proven 
what you bring to this tribe.

346
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:43,145
But in doing so, you send 
your wife to Exile Island.

347
00:18:43,145 --> 00:18:44,876
What do you feel?

348
00:18:52,937 --> 00:18:54,199
I can not say anything.

349
00:18:56,579 --> 00:19:00,958
On your side, Val, how does it 
feel to see your husband like this?

350
00:19:01,992 --> 00:19:03,622
I sympathize, but...

351
00:19:04,066 --> 00:19:06,663
I'll be back. I am a fighter.

352
00:19:07,734 --> 00:19:11,327
Jeremy, you win 
fire for your tribe, in the form of flint.

353
00:19:11,327 --> 00:19:13,434
Take it, it's well deserved.

354
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,549
- Cheer! 
- And a bag of beans.

355
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:20,177
Now let's see who will be 
with your wife on Exile Island.

356
00:19:20,705 --> 00:19:24,733
You will choose 
a person in your tribe

357
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:26,775
to accompany him.

358
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,429
Shit.

359
00:19:31,696 --> 00:19:34,607
A crucial decision, 
at the very beginning of the game...

360
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:35,738
I already know.

361
00:19:41,552 --> 00:19:42,777
Who will go with her?

362
00:19:47,337 --> 00:19:48,425
- Me? 
- Yes.

363
00:19:48,707 --> 00:19:49,803
And why?

364
00:19:49,803 --> 00:19:52,235
'Cause I know 
he knows how to light a fire,

365
00:19:52,235 --> 00:19:53,882
that he is used to the great outdoors,

366
00:19:54,218 --> 00:19:55,832
and that he can take care of her.

367
00:19:55,832 --> 00:19:59,011
He's the guy who lost the scraper

368
00:19:59,011 --> 00:20:00,347
and broke the flint!

369
00:20:00,347 --> 00:20:02,184
It was his son's fault, 
not his!

370
00:20:02,184 --> 00:20:03,579
Bullshit!

371
00:20:07,637 --> 00:20:10,067
- Keith, what do you think? 
- No problem.

372
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:11,178
- Yeah? 
- Yeah.

373
00:20:11,178 --> 00:20:12,653
You seem moved.

374
00:20:12,653 --> 00:20:16,099
It's true. I am for them.

375
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,196
I see what they are going through.

376
00:20:18,196 --> 00:20:21,574
And I think all of us, 
probably...

377
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:24,868
That before the end, each of us...

378
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:30,740
I don't know, I don't want to leave, 
no more than him or her,

379
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,144
but we'll deal with it.

380
00:20:34,452 --> 00:20:35,926
Switch places.

381
00:20:35,926 --> 00:20:37,764
You go up, you go down.

382
00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:51,393
Good. Your card to exile.

383
00:20:51,393 --> 00:20:52,572
Thank you sir.

384
00:20:52,855 --> 00:20:56,902
You will join your tribes in time 
for the immunity test.

385
00:20:57,312 --> 00:21:00,236
Val, Keith, on their way to exile!

386
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:13,375
Hunahpu, the map 
to find your camp. Go for it!

387
00:21:14,262 --> 00:21:15,719
I knew it 
was Blood vs. Water,

388
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:18,118
but doing this to my wife 
was my worst nightmare.

389
00:21:18,118 --> 00:21:19,920
And now she's gone.

390
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,096
And it's my fault!

391
00:21:42,147 --> 00:21:43,645
- With us! 
- Yeah!

392
00:21:43,645 --> 00:21:45,064
We are at home!

393
00:21:45,064 --> 00:21:47,089
We walked 
on this beautiful beach.

394
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:49,537
An epic "Survivor moment".

395
00:21:49,537 --> 00:21:52,809
I have goose bumps. 
It's really crazy, because all of a sudden...

396
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:55,172
"Oh, and now 
we just have to get on with it!"

397
00:21:55,172 --> 00:21:57,055
That's it, you have to go!

398
00:21:57,055 --> 00:21:58,422
I'm happy, we have nails.

399
00:21:59,937 --> 00:22:02,604
We have official "Survivor" bags!

400
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:05,180
Rusty things 
to catch tetanus!

401
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,597
It's Christmas!

402
00:22:07,336 --> 00:22:08,667
- Good start! Cheer! 
- Yeah!

403
00:22:09,811 --> 00:22:11,287
Yes, and thank you!

404
00:22:11,726 --> 00:22:13,780
We will all find ourselves 
in this situation at some point.

405
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,247
- I say. 
- Each of us.

406
00:22:15,247 --> 00:22:16,513
- I mean... 
- You really rocked.

407
00:22:16,513 --> 00:22:20,277
I have the greatest respect 
for what you have done.

408
00:22:20,277 --> 00:22:22,686
- I say. 
- No one saw this coming.

409
00:22:22,686 --> 00:22:24,081
- No, huh? 
- Nobody.

410
00:22:24,081 --> 00:22:27,013
Everyone congratulated me, 
told me it was hard for me,

411
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,135
to confront my wife, and all that.

412
00:22:29,135 --> 00:22:32,998
But everyone is happy that 
I won the flint and the beans.

413
00:22:32,998 --> 00:22:34,324
- Come! 
- Let's go!

414
00:22:35,302 --> 00:22:38,338
But in 
testing against my wife,

415
00:22:38,338 --> 00:22:39,377
I thought...

416
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:47,395
I was like, 
"I'm not going to cry", you know?

417
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:50,321
And then, from day 1...

418
00:22:50,321 --> 00:22:52,203
They are going to kill me, at home!

419
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:59,266
That we confront each other 
like this hurts me.

420
00:22:59,266 --> 00:23:01,082
But to see her go?

421
00:23:01,082 --> 00:23:03,635
Oh-oh, man... Yeah!

422
00:23:04,311 --> 00:23:06,339
She's my wife, I have to protect her.

423
00:23:06,707 --> 00:23:08,415
And I didn't.

424
00:23:08,415 --> 00:23:11,102
In Blood vs. Water, 
you have to think of your loved ones.

425
00:23:11,102 --> 00:23:13,179
For Val and me, in this game,

426
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:15,924
the important thing is our couple.

427
00:23:15,924 --> 00:23:17,650
But it does 
n't look good for her.

428
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,699
What are you thinking about?

429
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:21,970
I have a good contact with women, 
I get on well with them.

430
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,924
So it's time 
to go all out, time to play.

431
00:23:25,912 --> 00:23:28,642
You look like a good guy, 
I smell you good.

432
00:23:28,642 --> 00:23:30,298
We have to stay united.

433
00:23:30,298 --> 00:23:31,466
- I say. 
- I mean...

434
00:23:31,466 --> 00:23:33,857
We can be a strong pair,

435
00:23:33,857 --> 00:23:35,690
a solid duo, hopefully.

436
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,878
OK fine!

437
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:40,804
That's what I think. 
I was talking with Kelley.

438
00:23:40,804 --> 00:23:42,998
Since there are nine of us, 
we need five people.

439
00:23:42,998 --> 00:23:44,071
What do you think of her?

440
00:23:44,071 --> 00:23:45,951
- I like it. 
- You like him? OK.

441
00:23:45,951 --> 00:23:48,081
I appreciate Jeremy. The way 
he fought today,

442
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:51,764
his emotion when he had to 
send his wife into exile,

443
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,385
it shows that he has a good heart.

444
00:23:54,385 --> 00:23:59,298
So if I have to choose 
a twin, it's Jeremy.

445
00:23:59,607 --> 00:24:01,383
Everyone loves firefighters.

446
00:24:01,383 --> 00:24:02,776
What do you think?

447
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:03,947
And you?

448
00:24:04,962 --> 00:24:08,532
You seem super honest, 
so I'd like your sentiment.

449
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:10,667
- We need strength. 
- I say.

450
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:14,038
- But also smart people. 
- I say.

451
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:16,845
When we were married and divorced 
as much as I was,

452
00:24:16,845 --> 00:24:18,788
you learn to trust your instincts.

453
00:24:18,788 --> 00:24:21,922
And my gut tells me 
to go to Jeremy.

454
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,767
This game is so moving.

455
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:26,768
The beginning of the game 
immediately destabilized me,

456
00:24:26,768 --> 00:24:29,088
but I feel 
good now.

457
00:24:29,088 --> 00:24:31,042
Everybody's with me, 
I'm the popular type,

458
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:33,225
everyone wants 
to date the prom king.

459
00:24:33,225 --> 00:24:35,227
So it's perfect, 
it will work.

460
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,893
Are we building a rear or...?

461
00:24:49,893 --> 00:24:51,731
It's not a priority.

462
00:24:51,731 --> 00:24:53,842
- The roof has priority. 
- Oh, clearly.

463
00:24:53,842 --> 00:24:55,793
We're in Survivor!

464
00:24:55,793 --> 00:24:57,182
I have a machete!

465
00:24:57,182 --> 00:24:59,088
And you open a coconut!

466
00:24:59,384 --> 00:25:03,036
First day, 
we take care of the essentials.

467
00:25:03,036 --> 00:25:06,011
Trying to make a fire, 
to have something in your belly,

468
00:25:06,011 --> 00:25:07,693
and build a shelter.

469
00:25:08,277 --> 00:25:10,383
- You are a student? 
- Yes.

470
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,094
How old are you? I am 28 years old.

471
00:25:16,954 --> 00:25:20,105
It's a young group, 
with Wes, Baylor, Alec,

472
00:25:20,105 --> 00:25:22,793
this is the young group. 
Then there's me

473
00:25:22,793 --> 00:25:24,443
Josh and Jaclyn, 
more or less in the middle,

474
00:25:24,443 --> 00:25:26,661
and then the other guy, 
who's 40,

475
00:25:27,803 --> 00:25:30,535
and dad is, like, 55, seriously!

476
00:25:30,535 --> 00:25:32,642
- 32 years old is not old. 
- Older than me!

477
00:25:32,642 --> 00:25:33,619
It's true!

478
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:36,794
- As long as it's more than me... 
- Yeah, exactly!

479
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:40,046
From the outset, it is clearly:

480
00:25:40,046 --> 00:25:43,297
"OK, I'm 25 years older 
than almost everyone here."

481
00:25:44,118 --> 00:25:45,445
- How old are the others? 
- You're not the oldest.

482
00:25:45,445 --> 00:25:48,137
I'm an independent farmer, 
I've been doing this all my life.

483
00:25:48,137 --> 00:25:50,030
We don't get many visitors.

484
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,760
- What's the old man's name? 
- Dale.

485
00:25:52,436 --> 00:25:54,655
- I'll call him daddy. 
- Too bright.

486
00:25:55,206 --> 00:25:57,349
My biggest challenge in Survivor

487
00:25:57,349 --> 00:26:00,841
is that I'm not used 
to being in a group of strangers.

488
00:26:00,841 --> 00:26:01,795
It's hard.

489
00:26:01,795 --> 00:26:04,665
But you always have to 
look for the positives.

490
00:26:07,678 --> 00:26:09,125
On my first trip to the well,

491
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:11,214
I put the cover back in place,

492
00:26:11,214 --> 00:26:14,401
and there is a small emblem. 
It's not an idol

493
00:26:14,401 --> 00:26:16,164
but it could be useful one day.

494
00:26:16,164 --> 00:26:17,108
Why not?

495
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:21,695
I have to find another way 
to fit into this tribe, fast.

496
00:26:26,435 --> 00:26:27,991
The other way worked better.

497
00:26:30,482 --> 00:26:33,684
I'm trying to make a fire 
so we can boil some water.

498
00:26:34,939 --> 00:26:39,562
It's smoking, but it's too wet 
to create an ember.

499
00:26:39,562 --> 00:26:42,772
That's why Bic 
earns a billion a year!

500
00:26:43,014 --> 00:26:46,935
I was getting more and more 
pissed off at myself.

501
00:26:46,935 --> 00:26:49,211
I'm supposed to be able to start 
a fire, I've done that before.

502
00:26:49,211 --> 00:26:52,483
Kid, I've done it 
plenty of times with a magnifying glass.

503
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:57,509
Next!

504
00:26:57,509 --> 00:26:59,276
We need fire

505
00:26:59,276 --> 00:27:03,360
then we have two groups 
with two different methods.

506
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,222
Dale uses 
his glasses and the sun.

507
00:27:07,222 --> 00:27:09,805
Which I've never seen work.

508
00:27:10,317 --> 00:27:12,144
Frustrating bastard!

509
00:27:12,144 --> 00:27:14,426
- And the second group,... 
- There you are, Wes!

510
00:27:14,911 --> 00:27:15,874
You and it is, you and it is!

511
00:27:15,874 --> 00:27:19,054
...it's two of us 
rubbing and rubbing

512
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,880
and try 
to get something.

513
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,175
How are you, Dale?

514
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:25,698
Bon sang!

515
00:27:25,698 --> 00:27:28,506
- I broke them. 
- Oh, you did it on purpose?

516
00:27:28,506 --> 00:27:29,925
Double power!

517
00:27:29,925 --> 00:27:33,094
There's... Oh damn it! 
You're right!

518
00:27:34,135 --> 00:27:35,953
I broke my glasses in half,

519
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:38,687
and doubled the lenses 
to double the magnification.

520
00:27:38,687 --> 00:27:42,149
I sacrifice my ability to see 
later in the game

521
00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:43,685
to be able to light a fire.

522
00:28:01,307 --> 00:28:03,285
- Let's go friends! 
- Yeah! Yeah!

523
00:28:03,285 --> 00:28:05,042
We have fire!

524
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:11,126
Dale, I love you!

525
00:28:11,126 --> 00:28:14,557
To be frank, initially 
we look at the old,

526
00:28:14,557 --> 00:28:16,998
and we see an immediate target, 
and then...

527
00:28:16,998 --> 00:28:18,809
It was Dale who saved us all!

528
00:28:18,809 --> 00:28:22,684
Day 1, when we 
really needed it, it did.

529
00:28:22,684 --> 00:28:24,723
Thanks, Dale, you're a badass!

530
00:28:24,723 --> 00:28:26,660
I've said it at least ten times!

531
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,906
Dale the boss!

532
00:28:29,268 --> 00:28:32,565
I don't have as much to worry 
about socially anymore.

533
00:28:32,565 --> 00:28:34,099
I'm the firemaker 
now.

534
00:28:34,099 --> 00:28:38,095
It takes me up 
the food chain.

535
00:28:38,095 --> 00:28:40,113
- Dale the chief! 
- Dale the crack!

536
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,784
We literally owe you 
our survival tonight.

537
00:28:52,491 --> 00:28:53,462
Here we are.

538
00:28:53,462 --> 00:28:57,165
Arriving on Exile Island 
was a big shock.

539
00:28:57,462 --> 00:29:00,359
The Coyopa tribe is 
bonding.

540
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:04,435
If they have to eliminate someone, 
I'll probably be the first.

541
00:29:04,435 --> 00:29:08,668
And as a bonus, the island of Exile, 
she fears a lot!

542
00:29:08,668 --> 00:29:10,837
It's a lonely pile of rocks,

543
00:29:10,837 --> 00:29:15,194
the ocean seems impractical, 
you are really left with nothing.

544
00:29:16,638 --> 00:29:17,470
Where do you want to start?

545
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,057
Yeah, let's see that.

546
00:29:20,022 --> 00:29:23,052
I'm thinking of playing Survivor, 
going all the way,

547
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:25,517
and boom! I'm on Exile Island!

548
00:29:25,517 --> 00:29:28,538
I'm the first to squirt, with Val!

549
00:29:28,925 --> 00:29:31,719
- Are we looking for shelter? 
- Yeah.

550
00:29:32,218 --> 00:29:34,354
It's not what I had expected.

551
00:29:34,354 --> 00:29:36,348
I don't 
even know my tribe yet.

552
00:29:36,348 --> 00:29:37,726
I don't want to be here.

553
00:29:38,518 --> 00:29:40,236
Is there something in this tree?

554
00:29:41,123 --> 00:29:43,412
Maybe something to look into.

555
00:29:44,018 --> 00:29:46,127
"Each must choose an urn."

556
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:48,336
You go-y!

557
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:49,941
I'll take this one.

558
00:29:49,941 --> 00:29:52,283
He took his urn and I mine.

559
00:29:52,283 --> 00:29:54,419
Everyone had a message 
and started reading it.

560
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:55,867
Let's see.

561
00:29:56,291 --> 00:30:01,341
I was so concerned 
about my clue to an idol

562
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:04,816
that I didn't realize 
his was blank.

563
00:30:08,419 --> 00:30:09,651
What does it say?

564
00:30:09,651 --> 00:30:13,716
Mine? It 
's about something about the camp.

565
00:30:14,044 --> 00:30:17,072
I think he was hoping 
that I would say "Oh, read it!".

566
00:30:17,072 --> 00:30:18,601
I wasn't going to do that.

567
00:30:18,601 --> 00:30:20,038
There are other things.

568
00:30:21,141 --> 00:30:23,473
Let's see.

569
00:30:23,473 --> 00:30:26,353
Mine was blank. 
I always have luck.

570
00:30:28,313 --> 00:30:30,252
She beat around the bush.

571
00:30:30,576 --> 00:30:33,775
It has to do with his tribe. 
More power for her.

572
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,743
Me, I'm not going back to 
his tribe, but to mine.

573
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,060
Are you from Louisiana?

574
00:30:41,161 --> 00:30:43,220
I never made it past 
northern Arkansas.

575
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,164
Really?

576
00:30:44,164 --> 00:30:46,587
I would be completely out of place 
in Massachusetts.

577
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:50,023
. I saw this Boston t-shirt. 
- Yeah.

578
00:30:50,023 --> 00:30:52,024
And I saw his Cambridge t-shirt.

579
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,713
Yes, he is a firefighter in Cambridge.

580
00:30:54,713 --> 00:30:55,851
No kidding!

581
00:30:56,699 --> 00:30:58,710
Say, we have something in common.

582
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,560
- Are you a firefighter? 
- And Wes too.

583
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,605
It's not true!

584
00:31:01,605 --> 00:31:02,638
It is very true!

585
00:31:02,867 --> 00:31:05,753
I found 
out her husband is a firefighter.

586
00:31:05,753 --> 00:31:08,881
It will create a link. 
It will surely be a big plus.

587
00:31:08,881 --> 00:31:11,880
Back at camp, 
I'll go see Jeremy.

588
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,312
See where it fits. 
But who knows?

589
00:31:14,312 --> 00:31:16,937
I don't know what 
I'll be stepping into there.

590
00:31:17,488 --> 00:31:19,608
All eight hate me.

591
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:22,293
And that's the end 
of my career in Survivor.

592
00:31:42,218 --> 00:31:43,518
Where has everyone gone?

593
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:46,292
- Jeremy and... 
- I don't know.

594
00:31:46,557 --> 00:31:49,452
I didn't want to, but it took

595
00:31:49,452 --> 00:31:52,452
that I take over 
the construction of the shelter.

596
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,198
I'm glad 
everyone helps me.

597
00:31:54,489 --> 00:31:57,679
- They had better bring back lots of coconuts. 
- Yeah.

598
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,961
There was a lot of work, 
I laid the foundations of the structure.

599
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:07,334
It was important to be above 
the ground, to have fresh ocean air.

600
00:32:07,334 --> 00:32:09,424
It will support people, is it strong?

601
00:32:09,424 --> 00:32:11,723
- That's the plan. 
- OK.

602
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:13,861
- You know what I mean? 
- No, I like it.

603
00:32:13,861 --> 00:32:16,917
I almost passed out while 
building it, hope it holds up.

604
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:22,947
I hope the tribe appreciates 
my efforts on the shelter.

605
00:32:22,947 --> 00:32:24,959
- Look at this! 
- I'm proud of you.

606
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:28,007
I've been a successful model 
for a few years.

607
00:32:29,132 --> 00:32:30,764
I don't hit in Europe,

608
00:32:30,764 --> 00:32:33,711
but my face is known 
in quite a few places.

609
00:32:33,711 --> 00:32:37,547
But I'm not here to 
be a model, but a Survivor.

610
00:32:39,281 --> 00:32:41,298
I took the shelter in hand.

611
00:32:41,298 --> 00:32:43,166
- I had never built one, but... 
- You rock!

612
00:32:44,116 --> 00:32:45,243
Lord!

613
00:32:45,243 --> 00:32:47,924
I'm not sure why 
Drew thinks he's in charge.

614
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,211
He's a little too arrogant.

615
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:51,624
The brave boy.

616
00:32:52,281 --> 00:32:53,927
Great!

617
00:32:53,927 --> 00:32:55,809
Being the woman that I am...

618
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:59,913
I'm dating John Rocker, 
and he was playing at the top level.

619
00:32:59,913 --> 00:33:02,728
He's an alpha male 
with a capital "a".

620
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:05,639
So I understand 
the mentality of guys.

621
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:09,210
And Drew... He's a young jerk.

622
00:33:09,924 --> 00:33:11,406
Badabing, badaboum!

623
00:33:22,135 --> 00:33:23,648
Do you know John's last name?

624
00:33:24,329 --> 00:33:27,825
- Nope. And you? 
- I think it is...

625
00:33:28,266 --> 00:33:31,048
- I think I saw him... 
- You think he's famous?

626
00:33:31,048 --> 00:33:34,554
Yeah, I think he's a sportsman, 
but I'm not sure.

627
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,414
I had my doubts about John 
from the start.

628
00:33:37,414 --> 00:33:39,636
I thought to myself that 
I had already seen it somewhere.

629
00:33:39,636 --> 00:33:43,090
I realized he had played 
baseball with the Atlanta Braves.

630
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:45,567
My favorite team!

631
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:47,643
And that was when they were on top!

632
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:49,355
What's your last name, John?

633
00:33:51,108 --> 00:33:52,473
- Wetlands? 
- Yeah.

634
00:33:53,896 --> 00:33:55,428
- You're sure? 
- Yeah.

635
00:33:55,428 --> 00:33:56,597
100%?

636
00:33:57,533 --> 00:34:01,379
I was hoping to remain anonymous 
in this game, to go unnoticed.

637
00:34:01,379 --> 00:34:04,574
If I was recognized, 
I wanted to lie,

638
00:34:04,574 --> 00:34:09,090
because I have rather lacked anonymity for 
the past 18 years.

639
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,268
What are you thinking about?

640
00:34:10,747 --> 00:34:12,064
I think it starts with "R".

641
00:34:12,064 --> 00:34:13,378
Wes pinched me.

642
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:15,236
It didn't take long. 
After two or three hours,

643
00:34:15,236 --> 00:34:17,251
"Your name is John, huh?".

644
00:34:17,552 --> 00:34:19,136
"And your last name?"

645
00:34:19,698 --> 00:34:21,632
Are there five letters?

646
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:26,505
- There are seven. 
- No, six!

647
00:34:26,505 --> 00:34:28,086
Y'en to Sept.

648
00:34:30,019 --> 00:34:34,025
OK. You look like someone who...

649
00:34:34,025 --> 00:34:35,299
...was in your school?

650
00:34:35,299 --> 00:34:38,128
- No, that I saw on TV. 
- Oh.

651
00:34:38,717 --> 00:34:39,756
He was a boss.

652
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,506
Back then.

653
00:34:41,506 --> 00:34:44,186
- When the Braves were good. 
- When they were awesome.

654
00:34:44,795 --> 00:34:46,114
OK, you got me.

655
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,929
It seemed to me. 
I didn't know if you were going...

656
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:50,461
...to pretend.

657
00:34:50,461 --> 00:34:52,348
- Keep that for you. 
- Yeah.

658
00:34:52,348 --> 00:34:55,557
"I'm trying to lay low.".

659
00:34:55,557 --> 00:34:56,773
I am happy.

660
00:34:56,773 --> 00:35:00,793
He's from Georgia, me from Louisiana, 
I knew who he was...

661
00:35:00,793 --> 00:35:04,361
There is a kind of connection. 
I play baseball...

662
00:35:04,361 --> 00:35:09,431
I couldn't fool 
everyone. I will have tried.

663
00:35:09,431 --> 00:35:15,127
Wes knowing my secret 
isn't necessarily a good thing.

664
00:35:15,127 --> 00:35:18,390
At the first tip, 
I'll be a little nervous.

665
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:20,411
I might as well try to eliminate Wes.

666
00:35:36,242 --> 00:35:38,593
Is it better if you close your eyes?

667
00:35:38,593 --> 00:35:41,221
No. It's a burning sensation.

668
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:44,284
It started suddenly, 
just lying here...

669
00:35:44,774 --> 00:35:46,893
All of a sudden, 
my eyes ignite.

670
00:35:46,893 --> 00:35:49,404
And now it's burning.

671
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:52,880
And I cry constantly.

672
00:35:54,341 --> 00:35:57,063
Survivor 
always has a dirty trick in store for you.

673
00:35:57,063 --> 00:36:01,727
"Ah, here you are in the middle 
of nowhere, you're not used to it!"

674
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:03,782
"And you have this!"

675
00:36:03,782 --> 00:36:07,590
We are here, 
we must take it and survive.

676
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:11,298
I'm in Survivor, 
that's what I'll do.

677
00:36:12,697 --> 00:36:15,325
Josh has such red eyes!

678
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:18,280
I hope I don't catch what he has.

679
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,451
It looks horribly painful.

680
00:36:21,009 --> 00:36:22,268
He can't even 
really open them anymore.

681
00:36:22,268 --> 00:36:24,646
Not a good sign, after three days.

682
00:36:24,646 --> 00:36:26,161
There is a plant here

683
00:36:26,161 --> 00:36:29,555
who, in case of contact,

684
00:36:30,135 --> 00:36:32,358
makes it itchy or something?

685
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:35,796
My only idea is those leaves 
we touched.

686
00:36:35,796 --> 00:36:37,159
Oh, the sap!

687
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,814
It is this plant, the sap!

688
00:36:38,814 --> 00:36:41,138
We pulled them out 
instead of cutting them.

689
00:36:41,138 --> 00:36:42,181
Do you think that's it?

690
00:36:42,181 --> 00:36:43,377
I'm telling you.

691
00:36:43,377 --> 00:36:46,827
It is realized that the sheets 
used for the roof

692
00:36:46,827 --> 00:36:50,534
have a poisonous sap, 
or something like that.

693
00:36:50,534 --> 00:36:52,007
So let's take them off.

694
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:58,471
We are therefore busy removing 
them and moving them away from the camp.

695
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,700
My eyes are telling you 
to keep this as far away as possible.

696
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,212
We got poisonous sap, 
scorpions...

697
00:37:05,212 --> 00:37:08,151
There could well be a cougar 
in the corner without our knowing it.

698
00:37:08,675 --> 00:37:14,131
There is danger, far from 
what I know and had imagined.

699
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:16,182
Come on, thank you...

700
00:37:35,561 --> 00:37:37,702
"Are you a female? Let's go!".

701
00:37:38,074 --> 00:37:39,424
I wish I had a tail.

702
00:37:41,594 --> 00:37:43,246
I've always done the andouille.

703
00:37:44,438 --> 00:37:48,576
But I'm deeper 
than I look.

704
00:37:48,887 --> 00:37:50,686
Nobody knows 
what's going on with me.

705
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:55,449
In February, my father learned 
that he had a brain tumor.

706
00:37:56,113 --> 00:37:58,033
Just there.

707
00:37:59,207 --> 00:38:00,742
It is incurable.

708
00:38:00,742 --> 00:38:04,748
I thought about it a lot, of course.

709
00:38:06,022 --> 00:38:08,225
I think I have no more tears.

710
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:15,128
Knowing that we don't have 
much time left to spend together,

711
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:18,841
deciding to come to Survivor 
was very difficult.

712
00:38:19,271 --> 00:38:22,040
But my dad 
is a big fan of Survivor,

713
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,989
and I would not have come 
without his blessing.

714
00:38:23,989 --> 00:38:26,769
I just hope I can 
watch it with him.

715
00:38:27,064 --> 00:38:29,438
And that he will be proud of me.

716
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:40,588
Over here everyone!

717
00:38:53,754 --> 00:38:58,451
Now here are Val and Keith, 
back from Exile Island.

718
00:39:02,832 --> 00:39:04,924
- This way! 
- Yeah, Keith!

719
00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:14,225
- I told you you'd hold on. 
- Thanks.

720
00:39:14,744 --> 00:39:17,611
Val, two days in exile. 
How was it?

721
00:39:17,611 --> 00:39:20,502
It's a desolate place, 
with little foliage.

722
00:39:20,502 --> 00:39:24,291
But this girl from the north and 
this guy from the south hit it off.

723
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:25,776
It went well.

724
00:39:25,776 --> 00:39:29,307
We can imagine that 
many relationships have been created

725
00:39:29,307 --> 00:39:30,877
during your two days of absence.

726
00:39:30,877 --> 00:39:34,279
Hope you find 
your place in your tribes.

727
00:39:35,475 --> 00:39:37,922
Ready for your first 
immunity test?

728
00:39:37,922 --> 00:39:39,685
Yeah!

729
00:39:39,685 --> 00:39:43,356
Today 
you will climb a giant tower.

730
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:47,385
At my top, both tribes 
will crawl under an obstacle.

731
00:39:48,049 --> 00:39:51,031
Then you will work together 
to collect three bags.

732
00:39:51,031 --> 00:39:54,249
They contain coins 
needed to reach the top.

733
00:39:54,537 --> 00:39:56,746
For the first wall, 
you will use a rope.

734
00:39:58,327 --> 00:40:00,904
For the second wall, 
you will use pegs.

735
00:40:01,263 --> 00:40:04,482
For the third, 
there will only be mutual aid.

736
00:40:04,482 --> 00:40:05,984
Once at the top,

737
00:40:05,984 --> 00:40:08,773
four members of each tribe 
will solve a puzzle.

738
00:40:11,614 --> 00:40:14,853
The tribe that finishes 
first wins immunity.

739
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,677
This is what you covet 
in this game.

740
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,135
With immunity, you are protected.

741
00:40:22,135 --> 00:40:24,130
Without, you are in danger.

742
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,833
The losers will go to the council,

743
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:30,098
where someone will be the 1st eliminated 
from Blood vs. Water.

744
00:40:30,098 --> 00:40:35,029
Coyopa, you also still play 
for fire, in the form of flint.

745
00:40:35,029 --> 00:40:37,370
One minute to organize yourself, 
and we'll begin.

746
00:40:44,078 --> 00:40:46,216
Let's go! For immunity!

747
00:40:46,216 --> 00:40:47,455
Survivors, ready?

748
00:40:59,218 --> 00:41:01,827
People mix 
under there, I like!

749
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:08,957
This is your first opportunity 
to introduce yourself to the other tribe.

750
00:41:10,528 --> 00:41:12,093
Alec has already hurt himself.

751
00:41:12,093 --> 00:41:13,247
Come on!

752
00:41:13,247 --> 00:41:16,447
People cut themselves. 
This land is unfriendly.

753
00:41:16,447 --> 00:41:19,870
One bag at a time, collaborating.

754
00:41:20,514 --> 00:41:22,650
Baylor takes care of it for Coyopa.

755
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:25,396
Natalie takes care of it for Hunahpu.

756
00:41:26,896 --> 00:41:28,223
Julie's turn to come up.

757
00:41:28,223 --> 00:41:30,346
Baylor takes care of the second bag.

758
00:41:30,346 --> 00:41:33,057
Baylor is now handling 
the third sack for Coyopa.

759
00:41:33,677 --> 00:41:34,833
Go girl, go!

760
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:37,822
- Go Julie! 
- Julie has her second bag.

761
00:41:38,369 --> 00:41:40,344
Kelley's turn.

762
00:41:40,887 --> 00:41:42,991
Baylor has all three, go for it!

763
00:41:42,991 --> 00:41:45,641
Let a person 
start to open first!

764
00:41:46,073 --> 00:41:49,842
John takes the rope for Coyopa 
and goes to try to hang it.

765
00:41:50,155 --> 00:41:53,063
Kelley has the third sack 
for Hunahpu.

766
00:41:55,876 --> 00:41:57,776
There is a learning phase.

767
00:41:57,776 --> 00:42:00,609
You have to throw.

768
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:03,248
John tries a new approach.

769
00:42:03,248 --> 00:42:06,047
It's way harder than it looks.

770
00:42:06,465 --> 00:42:08,785
This rope is very heavy.

771
00:42:08,785 --> 00:42:12,153
The hanging window 
is very narrow.

772
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:17,462
John hooks it up for Coyopa!

773
00:42:17,462 --> 00:42:18,903
He climbs first.

774
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:20,982
Use rope tension!

775
00:42:22,372 --> 00:42:24,679
- John came up. 
- Come on Wes!

776
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:26,289
Wes climbs in turn.

777
00:42:26,906 --> 00:42:29,334
Drew takes over for Hunahpu.

778
00:42:29,334 --> 00:42:30,833
Keith was unsuccessful.

779
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:32,078
Wes came up.

780
00:42:32,078 --> 00:42:34,656
Coyopa took the lead.

781
00:42:34,656 --> 00:42:35,845
More slack.

782
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:39,172
Come on, we'll get there!

783
00:42:39,172 --> 00:42:40,655
Nadiya came up.

784
00:42:40,655 --> 00:42:42,455
And this is Val.

785
00:42:44,651 --> 00:42:47,569
Drew narrowly misses for Hunahpu.

786
00:42:47,569 --> 00:42:49,471
And this is Jaclyn.

787
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:52,385
She is hesitant. 
We cannot hesitate.

788
00:42:54,854 --> 00:42:56,853
Drew made it for Hunahpu!

789
00:42:56,853 --> 00:42:58,729
Climb that wall!

790
00:42:58,729 --> 00:43:00,585
Drew flies over this wall.

791
00:43:00,585 --> 00:43:03,122
- This is Jon. 
- Come on boy!

792
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,456
Come on, Josh, go!

793
00:43:04,856 --> 00:43:05,885
On and goes, on and goes!

794
00:43:06,585 --> 00:43:09,122
And here is Josh. 
Go to the next wall!

795
00:43:09,122 --> 00:43:10,827
Pitons now.

796
00:43:10,827 --> 00:43:11,892
First peak!

797
00:43:14,142 --> 00:43:16,160
Hunahpu tries to come back up.

798
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,546
Josh climbs first 
with the pitons, no problem.

799
00:43:19,546 --> 00:43:20,449
- Come on! 
- Its good!

800
00:43:20,449 --> 00:43:22,874
Very good collaboration at Coyopa.

801
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,381
Keith rode for Hunahpu.

802
00:43:25,381 --> 00:43:28,059
Jeremy, the last to ride 
for Hunahpu.

803
00:43:28,059 --> 00:43:29,166
Take out the pegs!

804
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:30,941
- Come on! 
- There you are, there you are!

805
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,003
Come on!

806
00:43:33,433 --> 00:43:35,994
Wes, the last up for Coyopa.

807
00:43:35,994 --> 00:43:37,840
Now we gotta 
climb that third wall

808
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,751
as you can!

809
00:43:40,853 --> 00:43:43,752
Hunahpu is still 
on the second wall.

810
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:46,459
Nice collaboration at Coyopa.

811
00:43:46,459 --> 00:43:49,273
John is a human pyramid,

812
00:43:49,273 --> 00:43:53,345
letting people climb on him 
to reach the top.

813
00:43:54,204 --> 00:43:56,524
Hunahpu is still at the pitons.

814
00:43:56,524 --> 00:43:59,707
Here is Drew. All of a sudden, 
the test tightens.

815
00:43:59,707 --> 00:44:01,703
- You go-y, you go-y! 
- OKAY.

816
00:44:01,703 --> 00:44:03,211
And here is John.

817
00:44:03,211 --> 00:44:07,632
Wow, that's a lot of weight! 
Women shoot John!

818
00:44:07,632 --> 00:44:09,878
Superb collective effort by Coyopa!

819
00:44:09,878 --> 00:44:11,668
Come on!

820
00:44:13,073 --> 00:44:15,331
Julie rode for Hunahpu.

821
00:44:15,671 --> 00:44:18,392
Let's go, Alex goes there running.

822
00:44:18,868 --> 00:44:20,184
Josh grabbed it.

823
00:44:20,184 --> 00:44:22,953
Coyopa is upstairs. 
Attack the puzzle!

824
00:44:22,953 --> 00:44:24,208
Four people!

825
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:29,849
Hunahpu always strives 
to climb this wall. More than two.

826
00:44:33,329 --> 00:44:36,274
Jon, helped by Drew, 
there he is upstairs.

827
00:44:36,623 --> 00:44:39,886
More than Drew now, 
he has to climb this wall.

828
00:44:40,476 --> 00:44:41,716
And he does!

829
00:44:43,279 --> 00:44:44,706
Go on!

830
00:44:46,409 --> 00:44:50,342
The two tribes are tackling 
a very big puzzle.

831
00:44:50,342 --> 00:44:52,246
It is very complicated.

832
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:54,971
It is a symmetrical puzzle.

833
00:44:54,971 --> 00:44:58,471
These coins will go 
in a lot of different places.

834
00:44:58,952 --> 00:45:02,557
Are they in the right place?

835
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:05,246
You won't know until the end.

836
00:45:06,946 --> 00:45:09,582
Coyopa is making a lot of progress,

837
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:11,215
provided you are right.

838
00:45:11,215 --> 00:45:12,922
It's here! It's here!

839
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:16,520
It does not fit! 
Coyopa thought he was at the end,

840
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,389
but it doesn't fit! 
There is a mistake!

841
00:45:19,389 --> 00:45:22,243
- Flip it! 
- Yes! Yes!

842
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,991
Hunahpu believes to have found!

843
00:45:29,671 --> 00:45:33,873
Nope! So close, 
and yet not!

844
00:45:36,197 --> 00:45:37,973
Try something else!

845
00:45:37,973 --> 00:45:39,714
What is frustrating,

846
00:45:39,714 --> 00:45:44,422
it's that we believe we are progressing, 
and we realize... that we are not.

847
00:45:45,299 --> 00:45:47,539
Go! Go! Go!

848
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:51,386
The Hunahpu are very excited 
about their progress!

849
00:45:51,686 --> 00:45:54,464
They are getting closer. 
Are they right this time?

850
00:45:59,015 --> 00:46:00,551
It seems like!

851
00:46:00,551 --> 00:46:04,227
Yes! Hunahpu wins immunity!

852
00:46:09,302 --> 00:46:10,751
Well done Julia!

853
00:46:17,813 --> 00:46:19,993
Hunahpu, congratulations!

854
00:46:26,959 --> 00:46:31,918
Missy, it must be hard to be protected 
when your daughter isn't.

855
00:46:32,441 --> 00:46:34,129
Sure, it's hard, Jeff.

856
00:46:34,547 --> 00:46:36,107
It's my little daughter.

857
00:46:37,857 --> 00:46:39,490
But she's super-super strong,

858
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:42,209
and I know that no matter what, 
she will be fine.

859
00:46:42,723 --> 00:46:46,431
Natalie. In general, you are 
with your sister all the time.

860
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:48,749
Tonight she is in danger.

861
00:46:48,749 --> 00:46:52,106
I say. All day, 
I thought a lot about Nadiya.

862
00:46:52,106 --> 00:46:55,101
It's like half 
my heart is there.

863
00:46:55,101 --> 00:46:56,533
It's really very hard.

864
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:59,674
Advice tonight.

865
00:46:59,674 --> 00:47:03,119
Someone will be the first eliminated.

866
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,579
Take your things, return to camp.

867
00:47:04,579 --> 00:47:05,998
See you tonight at the council.

868
00:47:06,999 --> 00:47:09,246
It could well be me tonight.

869
00:47:09,246 --> 00:47:10,849
I would be very surprised.

870
00:47:10,849 --> 00:47:12,616
I alone made the fire.

871
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:15,665
But I'm the oldest of the bunch.

872
00:47:15,665 --> 00:47:18,219
You never know what will happen.

873
00:47:29,217 --> 00:47:33,278
Well done everyone!

874
00:47:37,226 --> 00:47:39,415
Does it look like the Taj Mahal?

875
00:47:39,415 --> 00:47:41,572
Hey, you sure did!

876
00:47:42,089 --> 00:47:44,784
I just joined 
my original tribe,

877
00:47:44,784 --> 00:47:46,843
and we started with a test. 
Boom, that's done!

878
00:47:46,843 --> 00:47:49,016
Then we get here, 
I see what they've done,

879
00:47:49,016 --> 00:47:51,330
and it looks like 
they worked well together.

880
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:53,065
I need to know 
a few names.

881
00:47:53,065 --> 00:47:54,652
- I'm Reed. 
- Reed.

882
00:47:54,652 --> 00:47:55,517
- Julie. 
- Julie.

883
00:47:56,516 --> 00:47:58,430
I didn't know what to expect.

884
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:01,493
To make my place 
in this tribe, having been absent,

885
00:48:01,493 --> 00:48:04,834
I will try 
to sneak in, to adapt.

886
00:48:04,834 --> 00:48:07,156
For now, 
just remember their names!

887
00:48:07,156 --> 00:48:09,342
I know Jeremy, 
and that's about it.

888
00:48:10,928 --> 00:48:13,764
I wanted to talk to you, 
because I owe you a debt.

889
00:48:13,764 --> 00:48:16,202
- I wouldn't say that. 
- But if.

890
00:48:16,202 --> 00:48:17,052
I owe you one.

891
00:48:17,052 --> 00:48:20,333
- It wasn't a chore. 
- But I owe you one.

892
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:23,743
Just before the test, 
Val and I looked at each other.

893
00:48:23,743 --> 00:48:25,492
She gave me a sign 
that she was fine.

894
00:48:25,492 --> 00:48:27,890
I knew then that 
Keith had taken care of her.

895
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:29,117
I don't know 
how far this will take her,

896
00:48:29,117 --> 00:48:30,648
but I feel indebted to him.

897
00:48:30,648 --> 00:48:32,278
- I pulled you out of line... 
- Yeah.

898
00:48:32,278 --> 00:48:35,245
- ...and I'll put you back in. 
- OK.

899
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:39,456
- You're one of us! 
- Jeremy is half on my side.

900
00:48:39,456 --> 00:48:42,022
He's a firefighter, so am I.

901
00:48:42,022 --> 00:48:44,520
Firefighters are a brotherhood.

902
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:48,492
But the other seven? No idea.

903
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:50,806
In a day or two, we'll know.

904
00:48:52,453 --> 00:48:53,783
We'll see what happens.

905
00:49:05,186 --> 00:49:07,960
We often swim in the sea,

906
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,799
then we go there, there is a kind of lake,

907
00:49:09,799 --> 00:49:12,026
it's soft water, it cleans.

908
00:49:12,026 --> 00:49:13,472
- Oh really? 
- Yeah.

909
00:49:13,472 --> 00:49:14,730
Welcome Val!

910
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:16,056
Glad you're here!

911
00:49:16,056 --> 00:49:18,366
- Thanks! 
- You're welcome!

912
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:22,263
After losing, 
I immediately thought...

913
00:49:22,263 --> 00:49:25,850
I haven't been able to play yet, 
and it may be over already.

914
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:28,836
So as soon as I found out 
where the well was,

915
00:49:28,836 --> 00:49:32,780
my clue was talking about, 
I went there.

916
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:35,427
I have to find this idol.

917
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,920
So, Natalie, how is it 
compared to The Amazing Race?

918
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,270
- Nadiya. 
- Nadiya, pardon!

919
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:49,440
Go on!

920
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,123
It's completely different.

921
00:49:51,706 --> 00:49:55,180
In The Amazing Race, 
you are given everything you need,

922
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:58,170
and basically it's up to you

923
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,371
to figure out what to do.

924
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:03,449
Nadiya is a known element. 
She was in The Amazing Race.

925
00:50:03,449 --> 00:50:05,995
She showed 
that she can betray someone.

926
00:50:05,995 --> 00:50:08,873
For the others, I do not know.

927
00:50:08,873 --> 00:50:11,077
Nadiya proved it. We have seen it.

928
00:50:11,077 --> 00:50:13,874
- Val is the easiest vote. 
- Yeah.

929
00:50:13,874 --> 00:50:15,326
She's only 
been here a few hours.

930
00:50:15,326 --> 00:50:17,533
But I 
would like to give him a chance.

931
00:50:17,533 --> 00:50:19,385
- I would say Nadiya. 
- No problem.

932
00:50:19,385 --> 00:50:23,570
Because I know his strategy 
in The Amazing Race.

933
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,409
I don't know The Amazing Race.

934
00:50:26,409 --> 00:50:29,317
In The Amazing Race, 
there is the U-turn, one can betray.

935
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:31,748
I saw her do that, 
I know a little about the game.

936
00:50:31,748 --> 00:50:33,848
I respect the game, it's the rules.

937
00:50:33,848 --> 00:50:36,342
But better to betray before being betrayed.

938
00:50:36,342 --> 00:50:37,390
I agree.

939
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:40,825
Dale and the other guys think 
Nadiya should leave,

940
00:50:40,825 --> 00:50:42,661
because she was 
in The Amazing Race.

941
00:50:42,661 --> 00:50:46,022
And... Of course we say yes!

942
00:50:46,022 --> 00:50:49,000
Then Nadiya approached me, 
a few minutes later.

943
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,565
- I am with you. 
- I knew it.

944
00:50:50,565 --> 00:50:52,845
And I know Natalie 
is with your guy over there.

945
00:50:52,845 --> 00:50:53,688
I am sure of it.

946
00:50:53,688 --> 00:50:55,924
We think the same of you.

947
00:50:55,924 --> 00:50:57,104
We are leaving.

948
00:50:57,104 --> 00:50:59,390
We'll discuss that a bit later.

949
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:02,688
As soon as someone 
approaches me, I say to myself:

950
00:51:02,688 --> 00:51:04,664
"Thank you Lord! They are coming to me!".

951
00:51:04,664 --> 00:51:06,204
And you know...

952
00:51:06,742 --> 00:51:08,174
This is the position 
I wanted to have.

953
00:51:08,174 --> 00:51:10,429
I succeeded. 
It was one of my goals

954
00:51:10,429 --> 00:51:14,549
"I want to work with you.".

955
00:51:14,549 --> 00:51:16,464
I counted you among the girls.

956
00:51:20,675 --> 00:51:23,232
"I counted you among the girls.".

957
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,136
My friend will tell you:

958
00:51:25,136 --> 00:51:27,424
this is one of the worst things 
anyone can say to me.

959
00:51:27,424 --> 00:51:28,796
But I don't blame him.

960
00:51:28,796 --> 00:51:30,865
People 
always put you in boxes.

961
00:51:30,865 --> 00:51:35,078
I'll keep my options open, 
I have quite a few possibilities.

962
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,224
I have my head on the block.

963
00:51:41,224 --> 00:51:43,696
I wasn't there, I didn't have...

964
00:51:43,696 --> 00:51:46,586
...no way to create links, 
I understand that.

965
00:51:46,586 --> 00:51:48,090
Now here's the thing.

966
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:50,130
Let's create a female alliance.

967
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:52,130
We can rally a guy.

968
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:54,013
Don't want to write history? 
It's about time...

969
00:51:54,013 --> 00:51:55,458
- ...girls show... 
- Damn, yeah!

970
00:51:55,458 --> 00:51:58,167
I like it!

971
00:51:58,167 --> 00:51:59,494
Seriously!

972
00:51:59,494 --> 00:52:01,264
And so, the girls get together.

973
00:52:01,264 --> 00:52:03,611
It was an opportunity to realize

974
00:52:03,611 --> 00:52:05,900
that we have to be welded,

975
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:08,357
and that if not, 
our options are limited.

976
00:52:08,357 --> 00:52:10,041
Which guy will join us?

977
00:52:10,041 --> 00:52:11,407
We need the majority.

978
00:52:11,407 --> 00:52:12,622
I've already seen Josh, that's enough.

979
00:52:12,622 --> 00:52:14,381
- It's... 
- Oh yes, of course!

980
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,961
He is with us, believe me.

981
00:52:15,961 --> 00:52:19,261
I definitely wanted to 
work with Josh, the gay guy.

982
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:22,325
We already count him as a girl.

983
00:52:22,325 --> 00:52:23,881
Let's think...

984
00:52:23,881 --> 00:52:26,329
...to guys we don't need.

985
00:52:27,384 --> 00:52:29,007
We can win events without him.

986
00:52:29,007 --> 00:52:30,767
- He lit the fire! 
- So what?

987
00:52:30,767 --> 00:52:32,511
We'll have flint tonight.

988
00:52:34,524 --> 00:52:35,469
Yeah, let's do it!

989
00:52:35,469 --> 00:52:37,005
The plan is to eliminate Dale,

990
00:52:37,005 --> 00:52:39,920
because it is thought to be useless 
in trials.

991
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,234
One two three...

992
00:52:42,062 --> 00:52:44,563
If I'm not the girls,

993
00:52:44,563 --> 00:52:46,554
I'll do what Josh does.

994
00:52:46,554 --> 00:52:48,327
I haven't been able to 
chat with him yet.

995
00:52:48,327 --> 00:52:50,988
of what his plans are.

996
00:52:50,988 --> 00:52:52,772
But I want to hear it first.

997
00:52:52,772 --> 00:52:54,264
Alright, so what's going on?

998
00:52:54,264 --> 00:52:56,130
Lord, many things!

999
00:52:56,678 --> 00:52:59,542
- The girls took me to the well. 
- OK.

1000
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:02,549
They want to vote Dale.

1001
00:53:03,048 --> 00:53:05,013
- And what do you want to do? 
- Vote with you.

1002
00:53:05,013 --> 00:53:06,637
- OK. 
- At this point, what do you think?

1003
00:53:06,637 --> 00:53:09,286
- Did you talk to the boys? 
- They're talking about Nadiya.

1004
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:11,738
But we have to see this.

1005
00:53:11,738 --> 00:53:14,045
There are many things in the air.

1006
00:53:14,045 --> 00:53:18,207
And I feel 
like that relies a lot on me.

1007
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,823
I feel right in 
between the alliance of guys

1008
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:23,498
and that of the girls.

1009
00:53:23,498 --> 00:53:26,270
That's the first damn tip, and...

1010
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:27,659
I feel...

1011
00:53:27,966 --> 00:53:30,279
As a fan of the show, 
this is an important moment.

1012
00:53:30,279 --> 00:53:34,650
But what matters is knowing 
who will take me the furthest.

1013
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:36,348
At this point, I don't know.

1014
00:53:36,348 --> 00:53:40,994
Sometimes those with the deciding vote 
end up in the worst position.

1015
00:53:40,994 --> 00:53:44,150
I don't even know 
if I'm going to decide

1016
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:46,519
before the board 
I'm going to vote for.

1017
00:54:22,188 --> 00:54:23,334
Behind you, torches.

1018
00:54:23,334 --> 00:54:26,425
Grab one 
and light it in the fire.

1019
00:54:32,095 --> 00:54:34,090
It is part 
of the council ritual,

1020
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:37,412
because in this game, 
fire represents your life.

1021
00:54:37,412 --> 00:54:39,704
If your fire goes away, so do you.

1022
00:54:42,197 --> 00:54:45,799
John, are you surprised? 
It's so hard to come here,

1023
00:54:45,799 --> 00:54:47,813
three days can 
seem like an eternity,

1024
00:54:47,813 --> 00:54:50,215
and before you even realize it, 
you eliminate someone.

1025
00:54:50,215 --> 00:54:52,942
It seems very fast, 
but that's the game.

1026
00:54:52,942 --> 00:54:55,546
It is the rule. 
Unfortunately, here we are,

1027
00:54:55,546 --> 00:54:59,299
while the Blues are 
probably partying on the beach.

1028
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:02,402
It's hard. 
There is no obvious choice

1029
00:55:02,402 --> 00:55:05,823
an insufferable lazy 
or a real jerk.

1030
00:55:06,395 --> 00:55:09,931
Nadiya, tell me 
about the spirit of the tribe.

1031
00:55:10,227 --> 00:55:13,561
It seems to me that we got along well 
from the start.

1032
00:55:13,842 --> 00:55:17,161
And suddenly we have 
this huge decision to make

1033
00:55:17,161 --> 00:55:20,416
that none of us are ready 
to take so quickly.

1034
00:55:20,416 --> 00:55:26,070
But you have to look at the attitude 
of people, their physical skills.

1035
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:29,513
I learned to always persevere.

1036
00:55:29,513 --> 00:55:32,097
Never give up. Life is hard.

1037
00:55:32,097 --> 00:55:34,687
Will you be sad, 
or smile,

1038
00:55:34,687 --> 00:55:36,704
make the best 
of the situation and move on?

1039
00:55:36,704 --> 00:55:38,739
If they give you lemons, 
make lemonade, right?

1040
00:55:38,739 --> 00:55:41,842
Make margaritas out 
of it, preferably.

1041
00:55:41,842 --> 00:55:45,476
It can enable a tribe 
to overcome adversity.

1042
00:55:45,476 --> 00:55:46,547
Josh, are you okay?

1043
00:55:46,547 --> 00:55:49,895
It's a very positive 
and upbeat way to play Survivor.

1044
00:55:49,895 --> 00:55:53,334
Yes. We must keep this optimism

1045
00:55:53,334 --> 00:55:55,416
and this motivation permanently.

1046
00:55:55,416 --> 00:55:56,869
It is essential in survival.

1047
00:55:56,869 --> 00:55:59,423
Because if you stop being positive,

1048
00:55:59,423 --> 00:56:00,503
you are dead.

1049
00:56:00,785 --> 00:56:01,852
Nadiya, I have to ask you.

1050
00:56:01,852 --> 00:56:05,898
What is the difference between 3 Days 
of Survivor and The Amazing Race?

1051
00:56:05,898 --> 00:56:08,869
Oh, Jeff, that's so different!

1052
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:12,006
In The Amazing Race, 
you are told exactly what to do.

1053
00:56:12,006 --> 00:56:14,347
"This is your island,

1054
00:56:14,347 --> 00:56:15,870
do what you want with it!"

1055
00:56:16,262 --> 00:56:17,217
You know!

1056
00:56:17,553 --> 00:56:19,974
Survivor took all the essentials away from me.

1057
00:56:19,974 --> 00:56:21,641
Water, shelter, food...

1058
00:56:21,641 --> 00:56:24,795
And also, and not 
least, my twin sister.

1059
00:56:24,795 --> 00:56:27,774
She is my only family in America.

1060
00:56:27,774 --> 00:56:29,843
We only have us.

1061
00:56:29,843 --> 00:56:31,729
But for the next X days,

1062
00:56:31,729 --> 00:56:32,978
here is my family.

1063
00:56:32,978 --> 00:56:34,568
And I'm surprised, 
we're doing well.

1064
00:56:34,568 --> 00:56:36,167
I am proud of our tribe.

1065
00:56:36,909 --> 00:56:38,424
Val, how was it for you?

1066
00:56:38,424 --> 00:56:42,343
You spent most 
of those three days in exile.

1067
00:56:42,343 --> 00:56:44,300
It's stressful, because I do 
n't really know these people.

1068
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,306
I haven't really 
had time to bond.

1069
00:56:47,306 --> 00:56:49,391
But exile also has its advantages.

1070
00:56:49,391 --> 00:56:52,092
Time to explore, 
find things,

1071
00:56:52,092 --> 00:56:57,005
hopefully that puts my 
mind at ease, regardless of the outcome.

1072
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:01,233
Jaclyn, who quickly bonded?

1073
00:57:01,233 --> 00:57:03,950
Who did you see get along real quick?

1074
00:57:04,848 --> 00:57:06,413
The boys, especially.

1075
00:57:09,939 --> 00:57:11,429
bonded immediately.

1076
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:13,592
So, Dale, 
how was it for you?

1077
00:57:13,592 --> 00:57:17,946
Because typically, the elders 
are often easy targets.

1078
00:57:17,946 --> 00:57:21,234
Yes, I'm 20 years older 
than most of them.

1079
00:57:21,234 --> 00:57:22,903
We have different interests.

1080
00:57:22,903 --> 00:57:26,123
It's hard to find 
topics of conversation.

1081
00:57:26,123 --> 00:57:29,818
So what do you do, 
knowing your age

1082
00:57:29,818 --> 00:57:31,732
can be enough to get you eliminated?

1083
00:57:31,732 --> 00:57:34,003
First, I prove my worth to the tribe.

1084
00:57:34,003 --> 00:57:36,959
That's why I took 
my reading glasses, and...

1085
00:57:36,959 --> 00:57:38,086
This is Jeff's rule:

1086
00:57:38,086 --> 00:57:40,051
fire is life. 
I tried to light a fire,

1087
00:57:40,051 --> 00:57:41,642
and after 90 minutes 
it didn't work,

1088
00:57:41,642 --> 00:57:44,159
so I broke them 
to double the lentils.

1089
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:46,575
And it still took 1h15

1090
00:57:46,575 --> 00:57:48,661
sun to light a fire.

1091
00:57:48,661 --> 00:57:51,916
What is the feeling when finally, 
you see flames?

1092
00:57:51,916 --> 00:57:55,513
An immense relief, 
because it is the first need.

1093
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:58,064
Without fire, you cannot boil 
water or cook food.

1094
00:57:58,064 --> 00:58:00,046
We would have really suffered.

1095
00:58:00,678 --> 00:58:03,867
Wes, are there one or two people 
who are more attractive to others,

1096
00:58:03,867 --> 00:58:06,315
whose opinion 
and conversation are sought?

1097
00:58:06,315 --> 00:58:09,181
Yes, I think Josh 
is the most popular.

1098
00:58:09,181 --> 00:58:13,264
Everyone talks to him, asks him 
what's going on or if there are any problems.

1099
00:58:13,264 --> 00:58:16,764
We speak to him and he tells you that 
he understands,

1100
00:58:16,764 --> 00:58:19,564
May he support and sympathize with you.

1101
00:58:19,564 --> 00:58:21,390
He is empathetic.

1102
00:58:21,695 --> 00:58:23,182
Jeff, I agree.

1103
00:58:23,182 --> 00:58:28,878
It has the advantage of being 
between the girls and the boys.

1104
00:58:28,878 --> 00:58:31,600
For me, he is one of the girls.

1105
00:58:31,985 --> 00:58:33,253
Because he's gay?

1106
00:58:33,253 --> 00:58:35,446
- Or because... 
- I think the fact that he's gay,

1107
00:58:35,446 --> 00:58:39,130
it helps. Clearly, I will 
never see a straight person as "a girlfriend".

1108
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,156
Josh, that's an interesting position.

1109
00:58:43,156 --> 00:58:45,314
Women like you, 
men like you.

1110
00:58:45,314 --> 00:58:47,203
Do you feel pressure?

1111
00:58:47,203 --> 00:58:48,973
If the four girls are together,

1112
00:58:48,973 --> 00:58:51,515
the other four guys too, 
and me stuck in the middle,

1113
00:58:51,515 --> 00:58:53,767
so my decision is crucial.

1114
00:58:53,767 --> 00:58:56,352
But that is surely not 
what is happening.

1115
00:58:56,352 --> 00:58:57,932
But it could.

1116
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:02,113
- That's always the big question. 
- Yes always.

1117
00:59:03,182 --> 00:59:05,400
Well, it's time to vote.

1118
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,904
Wes, over to you.

1119
00:59:22,081 --> 00:59:24,204
We all love you, darling. 
You have a great personality.

1120
00:59:24,204 --> 00:59:26,847
But you have way too much 
The Amazing Race experience.

1121
00:59:37,577 --> 00:59:39,553
Because you are isolated.

1122
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:05,149
I will count the votes.

1123
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:08,162
Oh my God!

1124
01:00:08,162 --> 01:00:09,868
It's too intense!

1125
01:00:15,385 --> 01:00:17,935
If anyone has an 
immunity idol and wants to play it,

1126
01:00:17,935 --> 01:00:19,935
now is the time to do it.

1127
01:00:27,133 --> 01:00:29,077
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

1128
01:00:29,077 --> 01:00:32,077
The eliminated person 
will leave the council immediately.

1129
01:00:32,077 --> 01:00:33,139
I will read the votes.

1130
01:00:36,779 --> 01:00:37,833
Nadiya.

1131
01:00:44,398 --> 01:00:47,431
One Dale vote, one Nadiya vote, 
one Baylor vote.

1132
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:51,380
Dale.

1133
01:00:53,752 --> 01:00:54,566
Nadiya.

1134
01:00:54,566 --> 01:00:58,044
Two Nadiya votes, 
two Dale votes, one Baylor vote.

1135
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:02,578
Dale. Three votes for Dale.

1136
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:07,572
Nadiya. New equality.

1137
01:01:07,572 --> 01:01:11,602
Three Nadiya votes, 
three Dale votes, one Baylor vote.

1138
01:01:15,884 --> 01:01:16,873
Nadiya.

1139
01:01:17,208 --> 01:01:21,043
Four Nadiya votes, 
three Dale votes, one Baylor vote.

1140
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:29,782
First Person Eliminated 
- San Juan del Sur...

1141
01:01:29,782 --> 01:01:32,094
Nadia. Bring me your torch.

1142
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,586
Nadiya, the tribe has spoken.

1143
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:48,744
It's time to go.

1144
01:01:58,874 --> 01:02:00,592
I think the message is clear.

1145
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:03,857
You lost both events, 
a third of the tribe received votes,

1146
01:02:03,857 --> 01:02:06,373
this tribe is still looking for itself.

1147
01:02:57,726 --> 01:02:59,575
I'm after him now. 
Period.

1148
01:02:59,999 --> 01:03:02,051
I feel cheated by John.

1149
01:03:02,805 --> 01:03:04,372
Officially, you give up.

1150
01:03:04,372 --> 01:03:05,794
I'm glad he's gone.

1151
01:03:05,794 --> 01:03:07,319
You just lost a limb.

1152
01:03:07,723 --> 01:03:09,026
It's the war.

1153
01:03:09,026 --> 01:03:10,854
We will fight until the end.

1154
01:03:10,854 --> 01:03:11,848
Count on it!

1155
01:03:11,848 --> 01:03:13,788
If you're a man, 
I'll knock your teeth out.

1156
01:03:16,655 --> 01:03:18,924
This is my 2nd time going out 
first, it sucks!

1157
01:03:22,185 --> 01:03:24,655
Everything is possible. 
We can have regrets,

1158
01:03:24,655 --> 01:03:26,519
but it's like that.

1159
01:03:26,519 --> 01:03:29,441
I'm not surprised, 
but I'm clearly disappointed.

1160
01:03:29,441 --> 01:03:31,224
I hope Natalie will win.

1161
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:33,655
It will be hard, 
without someone to support him.

1162
01:03:33,655 --> 01:03:36,369
But I will support her until the end.
