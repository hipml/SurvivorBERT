1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,878
>> JEFF: Previously on

2
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:06,047
<i>Survivor,</i> Keith and Tina
plotted to take down Jerri.

3
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:08,508
>> TINA: She's the most bossy,
domineering person I've ever

4
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:10,927
met.
>> KEITH: I didn't come out here

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,762
to be pushed around by a
bartender-wannabe-actress.

6
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,764
>> JEFF: Jerri persuaded Colby
to make a deal.

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,975
>> COLBY: It's me, you and
Amber, through to the end.

8
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:18,643
>> JERRI: It's not like you're
making a deal with the devil

9
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:21,104
here.
>> COLBY: I simply agreed to go

10
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,273
along with them to get me down
the road a little better.

11
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,734
>> JEFF: Kimmi's morals were
compromised when the tribe won

12
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,110
chickens in a reward challenge.
>> KIMMI: Don't break her wings,

13
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,945
though.
Can't they give us some edamame,

14
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:32,073
some tofu...?
>> JEFF: Michael shocked his

15
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,450
tribe by killing a pig.
>> KIMMI: We live in a sick

16
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:34,409
tribe.
>> ELISABETH: We're going to get

17
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:37,954
strong now.
>> JEFF: Kucha continued their

18
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:40,582
winning streak by taking the
immunity challenge, sending

19
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:43,585
Ogakor back to Tribal Council
for the third consecutive time,

20
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,295
where the vote was deadlocked in
a double tie between Keith and

21
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:48,631
Mitchell.
One vote is the difference.

22
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,343
But ultimately it was Mitchell
who was voted out, putting a

23
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,137
dent in Jerri's hopes for an
alliance.

24
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,056
12 are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?

25
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:09,963
(<i> birds chirping</i> )
>> COLBY: We really started

26
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:19,222
(<i> birds chirping</i> )
>> COLBY: We really started

27
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:23,935
noticing the smoke and hearing
the trees explode and crash.

28
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:28,189
Uh, yesterday, I guess, is when
it got the closest to us.

29
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:33,069
And now we're just completely
pretty much overtaken by smoke.

30
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:37,490
>> AMBER: My eyes are watering.
>> TINA: It's just extremely

31
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:42,203
hazy and smoky, and...
It's an interesting morning.

32
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,915
>> AMBER: We've had an
interesting past couple of days,

33
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,043
as far as, uh...
Let's see, our last Tribal

34
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,922
Council we lost Mitchell, which
was a surprise.

35
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:57,594
>> JERRI: It was a pretty...
pretty traumatic evening.

36
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,388
I think our little group of
common voters has been busted

37
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:03,433
up.
It's a whole new ball game right

38
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:08,730
now.
>> KEITH: Love this game.

39
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:14,319
>> JERRI (<i> half-whispering</i> ):
Tina and Keith are definitely

40
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,154
grouped together, but Colby is
like the one in the middle,

41
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:19,115
like...
>> AMBER: They're totally

42
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,951
grouping together.
>> JERRI: Everybody else is

43
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,661
trying to pair up, or they're
trying...

44
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:24,621
We're all vying for Colby's
vote.

45
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,414
>> COLBY: I'm playing from the
center, dude.

46
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:30,084
I'm playing from...
(<i> Keith laughing</i> )

47
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,254
Let's squash this one.
>> AMBER: Seems like since Tina

48
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:37,300
was able to get Colby to sway
his vote last time and vote for

49
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:40,303
Mitchell, seems like maybe he,
uh, might sway again to their

50
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,973
side.
But we're almost kind of

51
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,976
fighting over him.
>> COLBY: What we did was

52
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,103
strategic, and it was to help
the team out, and I know it did

53
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:52,941
that.
>> JERRI: I have, you know...

54
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,943
I'm not harboring any ill
feelings whatsoever about the

55
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:58,321
whole deal.
We still are more powerful if

56
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,658
the three of us are voting the
same.

57
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,786
>> COLBY: I'm still voting just
like I did last night, based on

58
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,329
who the strongest... who I
think's got what it takes to

59
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,457
make it in.
Maybe tomorrow, I might be

60
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,335
thinking a whole lot different,
but... right now I'm not.

61
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,336
>> JERRI: I mean, it's basically
the end of any alliance, pretty

62
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:17,632
much.
>> COLBY: Jerri, I don't care.

63
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,217
I don't care about that stage of
it.

64
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,804
I mean, all I care about is
doing everything we can to win

65
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,222
the next two immunity
challenges.

66
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:28,518
That's the only thing I can
focus on right now.

67
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:44,033
>> KIMMI: Good morning,
stinkies.

68
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,743
We gotta clean you out, 'cause
you all stink.

69
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,371
Last night was a very
uncomfortable sleeping night.

70
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,289
It was drafty, it was cold.
Nobody slept last night.

71
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:54,544
Like, it was just like one of
those nights where anything and

72
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,712
everything that could wake you
up did.

73
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,338
>> JEFF V.: I woke up once, and
there was a hot coal on my

74
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:01,217
shirt-- look.
>> RODGER: You're kidding?

75
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,052
>> JEFF V.: And there was a
little fire in my wooly.

76
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,512
>> NICK: Whew!
>> ALICIA: "Fire in my woolly."

77
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,556
That's not the first time I
heard<i> that.</i>

78
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,932
Well, how the hell did it
bypass everybody else in front

79
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,435
of you?
>> JEFF V.: I don't know, but if

80
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,936
it came all the way back here,
it could have landed on your

81
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,687
face.
>> MICHAEL: That's exactly

82
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,522
right.
>> JEFF V.: Know what I'm

83
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,607
saying?
>> ALICIA: That's not funny.

84
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,485
>> JEFF V.: It's not funny.
The fire had been popping coals

85
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:23,406
out of the fire onto us.
>> ALICIA: Wow.

86
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,701
>> JEFF V.: So, we had to move
our fire this morning.

87
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:27,410
It just was getting a little too
dangerous.

88
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,887
>> KIMMI: Very good chickens.
They're very happy now.

89
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:58,483
Hello, hello...
>> JEFF V.: We got fire!

90
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,402
>> RODGER: It was a little
inconvenient right there, you

91
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,781
know, but boy, late at night,
nighttime, be...

92
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,950
Gonna be different around there
when it gets cold at night.

93
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,703
I guess we're ready to go.
Chicken killing time.

94
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,455
>> ALICIA: You know what,
though?

95
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,165
That hatchet needs to be
sharpened.

96
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:18,586
It's pretty dull again.
>> RODGER: Mike got the pig,

97
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,464
and, uh, we ate real good.
We wasn't able to save all the

98
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,425
meat, so I guess we're going to
eat chicken.

99
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,345
So, we won't have the eggs.
(<i> scraping continues</i> )

100
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,430
Sharp as possible while we're...
while we're doing the chicken

101
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,558
in.
>> KIMMI: Hello, ladies.

102
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,522
I have such brilliant hens over
here, yes...

103
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,983
>> MICHAEL: I just tell Kimmi,
"For your own self-preservation,

104
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,028
let go of the chicken thing.
Stop talking about them, stop

105
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,615
getting involved..."
>> KIMMI: What's going over

106
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,325
>> NICK: We're building a fire
to boil water, to kill the

107
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:52,161
chicken.
(<i> clucking</i> )

108
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,539
>> KIMMI: Well, that's my cue.
>> MICHAEL: Yeah, we're ready.

109
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,457
>> KIMMI: See you later, bye.
>> MICHAEL: Stop making a big

110
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,002
spectacle when you leave.
"Oh, you're butchering the

111
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,964
chickens, I'm out of here!"
Da-da-da-da-da!

112
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:07,176
You know, I mean, it's just...
It's too theatrical, it's just

113
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,386
too much.
>> KIMMI: Bye, chickies,

114
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:16,394
bye-bye.
>> MICHAEL: I'm ready.

115
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:20,523
I'm feeling the need to shed
some blood.

116
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:24,652
>> ALICIA: Whatever.
(<i> indistinct voices</i> )

117
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:27,363
>> RODGER: I don't... I don't, I
don't enjoy killing animals,

118
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:29,740
neither.
>> ELISABETH: Sure.

119
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,492
>> RODGER: I don't, really, but
sometimes, nobody wants to do

120
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,162
it.
Jeff, you want to do it?

121
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,372
>> MICHAEL: I thought Jeff
wanted to do it.

122
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:39,667
>> ELISABETH: Maybe next time.
>> RODGER: You got it?

123
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:48,843
(<i> pounding, moaning</i> )
>> ELISABETH: I like that.

124
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,721
Get these feathers off.
>> JEFF V.: Oh, they're hot.

125
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,723
>> RODGER: Yeah, this is by far
the right...

126
00:07:53,806 --> 00:08:05,568
>> ELISABETH: Good stuff.
That chicken's going to be so

127
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,278
awesome...
>> ALICIA: It's gonna be so

128
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,907
good.
(<i> indistinct voices</i> )

129
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,718
>> AMBER: Thank you.
>> KEITH: You're welcome.

130
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,221
>> AMBER: The food situation
could definitely be better.

131
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,555
It could always get better.
We're not eating that much at

132
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,266
all.
We're definitely not eating as

133
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,311
much as the other tribe is.
>> JERRI: When you come to see

134
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,772
me, we have to go somewhere and
get a really good pizza.

135
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,649
>> AMBER: Okay.
>> JERRI: And lots of garlic and

136
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:48,653
bread...
We haven't caught any fish for,

137
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:53,491
I think, two days now.
The whole hunger thing, that for

138
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:58,496
me has been a huge hurdle.
Keith, did you disassemble some

139
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,957
of these for the line the other
night?

140
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,292
The only ones that are rigged to
go are the cricket and the

141
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,629
silver one.
>> KEITH: Jerri went to go

142
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,632
fishing, and she needed the can.
And of course, she hollered out

143
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:13,386
to me, like her older sibling.
>> JERRI: What do you suggest we

144
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,013
do with the fish guts?
>> KEITH: I said we'll take them

145
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:19,517
to the end and dump them in the
water, like we've been doing it.

146
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,478
And so, she brought them down to
the water's edge down at the end

147
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,106
of camp to dump them out, and
then she yelled back that it's

148
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,483
not a smart idea to dump them in
there, because...

149
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,860
>> JERRI: We're literally
feeding the fish every time we

150
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,654
dump the guts down there.
>> KEITH: Well, my vote is you

151
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,949
just bury them in the sand down
by the end down there.

152
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,618
>> JERRI: The thing is, it's
also downwind from us, so once

153
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,370
they start rotting, if by chance
you get a second, if you want

154
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,663
to...
>> KEITH: I'll bury them.

155
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,790
>> JERRI: Yeah?
>> KEITH: No problem.

156
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,001
>> JERRI: That would be really
cool.

157
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:51,674
>> KEITH: It's all right.
I'm thinking on these couple

158
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:56,679
hundred acres of water, I'm not
sure that a few fish eating some

159
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:00,474
dead fish is going to matter a
whole lot, but whatever.

160
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:04,395
>> JERRI: It's just ridiculous
to me to continue to dump the

161
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:07,481
guts at the end of our beach.
We're literally feeding the

162
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,860
fish.
It's no wonder we haven't been

163
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,862
able to catch anything, they're
all full.

164
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:17,992
>> KEITH: It's not that big of a
deal, but apparently...

165
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,744
it was.
I don't stand up to her that

166
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:23,205
often, 'cause I don't find it
necessary, 'cause it's more

167
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,832
exhausting to argue with her
than anything.

168
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:35,092
The fish... are now... buried.
Dead fish.

169
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,012
>> JERRI: We haven't been
catching fish again, and the

170
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,057
other team is eating chickens
and pigs and eggs, you know.

171
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,561
And here we are over here,
starving to death.

172
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:48,731
>> KEITH: You have any?
>> JERRI: No luck.

173
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,734
Those are the things that I
didn't really think going into

174
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,236
this that were going to bother
me.

175
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,908
But it has.
>> KIMMI: ...something really

176
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,868
different.
>> ALICIA: No, no, I didn't get

177
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:04,080
upset about you; I left.
>> KIMMI: No, my point is, is

178
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,873
that with the, uh, chicken, I'm
just saying for these guys to

179
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:09,043
stay stronger, it's better to,
like, do<i> every</i> other day,

180
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,295
putting meat in their body.
>> ALICIA: You gotta be kidding?

181
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,214
>> KIMMI: I don't know.
>> ALICIA: We're active every

182
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,257
day, we need protein every day.
>> KIMMI: No, my points is...

183
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,218
>> ALICIA: That's not a good
argument, it's not gonna work.

184
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,928
>> KIMMI: This isn't like a
debate to be arguing about.

185
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,763
>> ALICIA: No, I know.
>> KIMMI: I'm just saying...

186
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:21,931
>> ALICIA: But I'm telling you
why I don't agree with you.

187
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,724
That's exactly the point.
>> KIMMI: Okay, well, you don't

188
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,060
have to agree with me.
>> ALICIA: And I don't.

189
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,103
So, there you go.
>> KIMMI: Okay, fine.

190
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,105
>> ALICIA: I'm tired of the
chickens, tired of it.

191
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,731
>> KIMMI: Excuse me?
>> ALICIA: Do you have some kind

192
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,483
of a problem?
>> KIMMI: Yeah, I have a problem

193
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,360
with your attitude.
>> ALICIA: Oh really!?

194
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,277
>> KIMMI: What the hell is up
your butt?

195
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,987
>> ALICIA: What you just said is
not true.

196
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,447
We should be having protein
every day.

197
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,615
If we have to have the chickens,
we will.

198
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,283
>> KIMMI: I'm just saying, if
you had the chickens here...

199
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,077
>> ALICIA: Right!
You see us going fishing, right?

200
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,496
>> KIMMI: You can go...
That's all I was saying-- it's a

201
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,789
good just thing to break it up,
especially...

202
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,999
>> ALICIA: You are the defensive
one about the chickens, not me,

203
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,126
so do not yell at me about the
chickens.

204
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,210
>> KIMMI: I am not getting
emotionally attached.

205
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,795
>> ALICIA: You can get as
emotionally attached as you

206
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,672
want.
Because the only reason why we

207
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:55,923
said it is 'cause we care about
your feelings 'cause you're part

208
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,426
in this tribe.
But don't jump all over me,

209
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,136
sweetheart, don't ever...
>> KIMMI: But the thing is, I'm

210
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,345
not getting upset.
Don't wave your finger in my

211
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,638
face.
>> ALICIA: I will always wave my

212
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:03,931
finger...
>> KIMMI: And mumble under your

213
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,433
breath.
>> ALICIA: You want me to say it

214
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,851
to your face?
>> KIMMI: Yes, if you have...

215
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,853
>> ALICIA: Yes, I will be happy
to.

216
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:09,937
I'm saying it to your face right
now.

217
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,230
>> KIMMI: Thank you!
>> ALICIA: I'm tired of you and

218
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,691
the... chickens-- you heard it!
>> KIMMI: What have I said about

219
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,860
the chickens, though?
Nothing! That's the problem.

220
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,987
>> ALICIA: Please, you and your
little...

221
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,324
(<i> didgeridoo playing</i> )
>> KIMMI: She has more of an

222
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,118
issue with the chickens than I
do.

223
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,745
Gosh!
>> ALICIA: I don't really

224
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,873
appreciate her to begin with, so
for me to try to walk away from

225
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:32,668
a situation I know is
potentially going to turn ugly,

226
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:35,546
and her not to let me do that,
made me want to just run up and

227
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:38,048
grab her by the throat.
But I-I had to keep my wits

228
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:41,677
about me, because that's not
what this is about.

229
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,345
>> JEFF V.: What did I just
miss? I was peeing?

230
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,221
>> ALICIA: Plenty.
I've never liked Kimmi, we all

231
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,475
know that.
So when she jumps on me, I will

232
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,809
go at her guns loaded, okay?
>> JEFF V.: What did she say,

233
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:49,935
though?
I totally missed it.

234
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,730
What happened?
>> ALICIA: Sitting on the floor

235
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,149
of the house, she goes...
>> KIMMI: Alicia has always had

236
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,443
a problem with me.
She said, "Kimmi, don't get too

237
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,695
attached to the chickens."
I'm like, "I'm not getting

238
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:00,821
attached to the chickens."
Like, don't worry!

239
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:05,409
I'm a big girl.
I said, "You know, while we have

240
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,995
the chickens here we shouldn't
just eat four chickens and a pig

241
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,371
back-to-back days.
>> ALICIA: I said, "You know

242
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,291
what, Kimmi?
This is why we didn't want you

243
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,043
to get emotionally attached to
the chickens."

244
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,545
That's all I said.
>> KIMMI: She's very critical of

245
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,006
other people, she's very
condescending of other people,

246
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,759
and I will not be treated, um,
you know, like a jerk-off.

247
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,385
>> ALICIA (<i> scoffing</i> ): Give me
a break.

248
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,222
If you're going to make sense,
you can say whatever you want to

249
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,014
me, but if you're not going to
make sense, keep your mouth

250
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:30,309
shut.
>> JEFF V.: I knew that that

251
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,894
Alicia/Kimmi explosion was
coming, I knew it was coming.

252
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,189
Kimmi was befriending the
chickens and giving them names

253
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,733
and petting them.
And, um, Alicia just has no

254
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:40,569
patience.
Alicia doesn't have a lot of

255
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,073
patience for anybody, really.
>> ALICIA: I had enough, and I

256
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:47,785
let loose, baby.
>> ELISABETH: Alicia is in

257
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,704
charge of telling people to do
things.

258
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:55,709
Alicia is also in charge of
talking trash about people.

259
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,794
>> ALICIA: We still have to stay
together as a team.

260
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,255
>> ELISABETH: We do.
>> ALICIA: So I'm willing to

261
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,925
live and let live.
>> KIMMI: I just think it was a

262
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,762
silly misunderstanding.
But we all are on the same team,

263
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,055
so we gotta... at least have a
poker face on for game day, I

264
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:22,695
suppose.

off the heat that the other fire

266
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,583
did.
>> ALICIA: This is the only

267
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,960
time, though, when the fire
really stinks, you know...

268
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,796
>> NICK: We moved the fire pit
away from our camp for some

269
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:44,425
safety reasons.
And we had it nice and close--

270
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,968
about five feet from where we
all sleep, so it was really warm

271
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:49,054
at night.
But we moved it away, and last

272
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:53,017
night was really, really cold.
>> RODGER: Coldest night for me.

Whew!
>> NICK: You know, what can we

274

do?
We don't have any blankets, so

275
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,316
then we just bundle up.

281
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:42,358
me out more than anything.
This Crocodile Creek is food and

bathroom to fish and crocodiles

00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,494
And it's just... I don't know, I
just find it to be incredibly

285
00:15:53,577 --> 00:16:02,378
gross.
>> MICHAEL: Kimmi, I don't know

286
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,881
if she's been in the water once,
and... the dirt's starting to

287
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:09,551
stick to her.
>> KIMMI: But also 'cause you

288
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,886
can see my tan line-- look at
it.

289
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:13,597
>> MICHAEL: You know, some, one
of the other girls puts on a

290
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,765
different top, you'll see a tan
line.

00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:19,186
When Kimmi puts on a different
top, you'll see a dirt line.

>> MICHAEL: You changed clothes.

293

filthy.

00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,026

Oh, because I was carrying tree

295
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,613
stuff today.
That's why my neck is filthy.

296
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,198

real defensive about it.

297
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,910

had a booger hanging out of my

You can only choose two.
Plus from your friends at

314
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,168
Target...
clean teeth and shampoo!"

315
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,586
>> KIMMI: Shampoo! Oh!
>> ELISABETH: Oh, my God, you

316
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,005
guys!
>> NICK: We get to pick two

317
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,715
things, we get to pick two
things.

318
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,342
>> ELISABETH: Okay, boxers and
slippers?

319
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,469
>> KIMMI: No.
>> ELISABETH: We'll skip that

320
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,095
page.
Toilet paper?

321
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,096
>> NICK: Blankets, we need
blankets.

322
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,931
>> ELISABETH: Blankets I think
is one, don't you?

323
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,141
>> RODGER: Blankets would be...
>> ALICIA: Blankets would be

324
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,311
wonderful, 'cause we really--
now that we moved our fire...

325
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,480
>> MICHAEL: I think we're all...
>> ALICIA: ...we really have an

326
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,106
issue with that.
>> ELISABETH: Yeah.

327
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,274
>> RODGER: Everybody wants the
spices?

328
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,442
>> ELISABETH: Oh, it is a
catalog...

329
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,401
>> RODGER: Raise your hand.
Everybody wants spices who...

330
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,779
what do you want?
Spices? I'll go with spices.

331
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:52,654
>> ELISABETH: The two items that
we chose... we definitely need

332
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,116
blankets.
Last night was really cold.

333
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,161
I had a miserable night's sleep.
I don't know if anyone really

334
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,996
slept through, especially
without our fire out here, it's

335
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:04,833
so cold.
We are going to choose for the

336
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,504
second item spices, and we get
toothpaste and shampoo when we

337
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,631
win this today.
>> ALICIA: "Travois."

338
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,466
They're using some French words.
>> NICK: A stretcher.

339
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,176
>> ALICIA: It's a stretcher, to
carry somebody in.

340
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,302
>> MICHAEL: Look how they show
the thing, though.

341
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,179
It's not like what you'd think.
It's a teepee... it's a

342
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,305
triangle.
>> ALICIA: Yeah, it's a tri...

343
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,974
>> ELISABETH: Wow!
>> NICK: We have to make one of

344
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,685
these, you guys.
So, how are we going to build

345
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,603
this thing?
Let's think.

346
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,188
>> KIMMI: Yes?
>> ALICIA: We could even make

347
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,190
something out of rope for her
feet to sit in.

348
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,360
>> ELISABETH: We could have add-
ins, like a pillow...

349
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,236
>> RODGER: If we use that bamboo
pole, how are we going to tie

350
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,697
onto that?
>> ALICIA: Those up there are

351
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,032
going to start to cross.
>> KIMMI: Is that real hard

352
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:39,243
wood?
>> ELISABETH: That can go right

353
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,161
under my butt.
>> JEFF V.: That's the width.

354
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,580
We want the length.
>> MICHAEL: Keep it tight where

355
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,165
you guys had it, at the top.
>> RODGER: Can you come around

356
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,043
this and tie a bunch of
slipknots in?

357
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:49,294
>> ELISABETH: Is that on your
head?

358
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,880
>> KIMMI: Yeah, but that's okay.
>> ALICIA: We're gonna need it

359
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,216
for the back corner...
>> RODGER: Are your legs still

360
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,051
where you can reach the corners?
Or you need to slide down a

361
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:58,178
little bit?
>> ALICIA: Rock solid.

362
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,515
>> MICHAEL: One, two, lift.
(<i> Elisabeth laughs</i> )

363
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,725
>> ALICIA: Feels stable enough?
>> KIMMI: Mm-hmm.

364
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,560
>> ELISABETH: Whee!
>> RODGER: All right, we got it

365
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:08,689
down.
>> ELISABETH: I think over at,

366
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,357
uh, Ogakor, they're probably
trying to pull it together

367
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,485
really well.
We have to go out there as if

368
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,113
we're facing a tribe just as
strong as we are.

369
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,574
>> AMBER: Who's gonna decide do
we want to make it like a

370
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:22,411
rectangle...?
>> JERRI: All right, here, give

371
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,414
me the goods, then just hold...
You hold onto that end, and as I

372
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,248
weave it just follow-follow me
with this.

373
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,374
>> COLBY: We're dragging this
thing.

374
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,168
We want the least amount of
friction we can get.

375
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,169
>> JERRI: Okay, so what's your
point?

376
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,254
What's wrong with this?
>> COLBY: I'm saying...

377
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,256
>> JERRI: Do you see what I'm
doing with this, though?

378
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,758
>> COLBY: Exactly, and I think
it's great.

379
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,093
I'm saying instead of starting
it over the top, start it

380
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:39,386
underneath.
>> AMBER: From underneath.

381
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,596
>> COLBY: You see what I'm
saying?

382
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,890
>> KEITH: We got two pieces...
>> JERRI: No, I don't see what

383
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,225
you're saying.
You guys want to, like, put her

384
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,602
in it and pick it up-- the four
of us-- just to see what

385
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:54,276
happens?
I got kind of tickled when

386
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,155
making the travois.
I knew that the idea I had would

387
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,156
work, and everybody was just
kind of standing around and

388
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:03,410
talking.
And no one was doing anything.

389
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:06,914
So I just kind of grabbed the
bull by the horns.

390
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:11,251
God bless America... this...
>> KEITH: I have probably a

391
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,670
little more patience than Colby
does.

392
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,465
But I can usually tell when he's
getting a little tense and a

393
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,175
little agitated, you know.
He'll walk away from it and just

394
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:27,643
take a breath.
>> JERRI: Let's try it this way,

395
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:34,816
just in case we're able to.
>> AMBER: Is it really bad?

396
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,489
>> JERRI: Yay, it works!
>> TINA: Ooh!

397
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,366
>> JERRI: Oh!
>> COLBY: The toughest part for

398
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,869
this tribe is coming into these
challenges with our guns

399
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,622
blazing, ready to rock.
We gotta win this thing, and we

400
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:59,216
still got a shot at doing it.
>> JEFF: Come on in, guys.

401
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:02,302
All right, well, we've already
established how tough it is

402
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:06,181
living in the Outback.
You're battling-- among other

403
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:08,016
things-- an out of control fire,
wildlife, crocodiles, snakes,

404
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,186
spiders.
If you get hurt, you are a long

405
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:14,147
way from help.
You have to be able to rely on

406
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,024
your tribe mates to get you back
to safety.

407
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,360
That's where today's challenge
comes in: triage.

408
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,028
You were asked to build a
travois-- a three-sided

409
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:23,532
stretcher.
You're going to use that today.

410
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,909
Two members from each tribe will
be the rescuers.

411
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,369
Three members will be the
victims.

412
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,372
You'll be placed at three
different spots out here on the

413
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,248
river on little sand spits.
There's a flag designating the

414
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:34,084
area.
There is a circle around that

415
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,004
flag.
The victims will stand inside

416
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,506
that circle.
When the rescuers get out there,

417
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,342
you get on your travois and you
head back.

418
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,679
Once they cross this line and
they're okay, they are

419
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,556
miraculously healed, they become
a rescuer.

420
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,433
Now you have three.
Going for the next person.

421
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:53,562
First tribe to get all three of
their victims back to the first

422
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,398
aid camp wins reward.
Now, Kucha, because you guys

423
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,317
have two extra members, two
people will sit out.

424
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,362
The winning tribe gets what they
wanted and also what the other

425
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,698
tribe wanted.
(<i> all groaning</i> )

426
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:07,367
>> ELISABETH: Shut up!
>> JEFF: So, Kucha, you chose

427
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,245
the blankets and the spices.
Ogakor, you also chose the

428
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:11,621
spaces and the soup mix.
>> ALICIA: It's a beautiful

429
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,583
thing.
>> JEFF: And Target has thrown

430
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,417
in a few other items.
They're not necessities, these

431
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,087
are luxuries.
Got fresh toothbrush...

432
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,297
(<i> murmuring</i> )
>> AMBER: Oh, my gosh!

433
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,591
>> JEFF ...toothpaste,
deodorant.

434
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,759
>> RODGER: Oh, yeah, we could
use that.

435
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:27,262
>> JEFF: And of course, what
every survivor needs, shampoo.

436
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,890
(<i> all cheering</i> )
>> ELISABETH: Wow!

437
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,391
>> AMBER: Oh, my God.
>> ELISABETH: That's awesome.

438
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,978
>> JEFF: Okay, you guys decide
who is going to sit out.

439
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:35,896
Decide on your rescuers and your
victims.

440
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:43,612
Wait for my start.
>> TINA: Go, Ogakor!

441
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:49,326
Come on, guys!
>> JEFF: Kimmi and Rodger,

442
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,454
you're sitting out for Kucha.
A lot of reward at stake.

443
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,499
Survivors, ready...
Go!

444
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:36,540
>> TINA: Go, go, go, go!
>> Dude, come here.

445
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,417
>> Go, go, go, go, go!
Pick it up!

446
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,805
>> KIMMI: Go, Kucha!
>> ALICIA: Guys, push, push,

447
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,765
push, push, push!
Get ahead!

448
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:13,994
(<i> team members yelling</i> )

453

>> Good job, Kucha!
>> RODGER: Good job, all right!

454
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,493
>> JEFF: Congratulations.
Nice job, Kucha.

455
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,454
>> It's all yours.
>> Good job.

456
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:01,166
>> JEFF: Here we go, guys.
>> NICK: Here's blankets.

457
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:12,594
>> RODGER: All right.
(<i> happy shouting</i> )

458
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:24,773
>> All right, all right.
>> AMBER: I'm just so tired of

459
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:29,611
losing.
(<i> sniffling, crying</i> )

460
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:33,031
>> TINA: Don't let 'em break
your spirit now.

461
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:51,800
>> COLBY: I am getting very
frustrated with losing.

462
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:55,553
If we don't turn up the heat and
turn this runaway train around,

463
00:25:55,637 --> 00:26:00,642
then it may be a meltdown for
the Colbster.

464
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:06,606
>> TINA: It's not the things you
lose, it's just losing.

465
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,360
You know, it takes such a
psychological hit on your

466
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:15,490
already psychologically tired
body that, for our team, it's

467
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:18,451
definitely the loss that hits us
hard.

468
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,844
>> ALICIA: Winning the reward
challenges is, basically, just

469
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:39,306
one more nail in the coffin.
Not as important as immunity,

470
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,391
but another thing that's gonna
sink them just a little bit

471
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,685
lower.
>> JEFF V.: I don't mean to

472
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,354
sound evil, but it's all about
kicking somebody's ass.

473
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,690
>> ALICIA: There's no way
they're gonna give up.

474
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:52,027
They were very graceful losers,
actually.

475
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,695
I'm just so glad we're not them
right now.

476
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,865
That's rough.
>> JEFF V.: Some of the people

477
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,242
in the tribe are talking about
how guilty they feel and how bad

478
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,536
they feel for the other tribe--
and screw it!

479
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:04,039
I mean, chop their heads off,
chop their legs off, this is a

480
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,665
game and I'm ready to beat every
one of them.

481
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:09,419
I'm ready to chop their heads
off and their eyeballs out so

482
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:15,508
Mike can eat them...
(<i> laughter</i> )

483
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,261
>> JEFF V.: I stink.
>> ELISABETH: Me, too.

484
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,721
>> ALICIA: Toothpaste and
toothbrush and shampoo and

485
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,223
deodorant.
I'm not going to know what to do

486
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,683
with myself.
>> ELISABETH: Oh, my gosh!

487
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:27,228
Shampoo that doubles as soap.
>> JEFF V.: Let's go wash.

488
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,230
>> MICHAEL: Everybody else
smells out here, but everybody

489
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,567
else bathes.
Thank God we won that challenge,

490
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:46,915
so that we can bathe Kimmi.
>> MICHAEL: Group bath.

491
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,793
We won the reward challenge
yesterday and we used the

492
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:53,046
shampoo-- we each got a handful,
and we just all soaped up,

493
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,590
'cause the camp was getting a
little stinky.

494
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:58,426
Some more than others, because
some people bathe more than

495
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,219
others around here-- but it was
fun.

496
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,596
>> RODGER: You've got to prove
that.

497
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:14,943
(<i> laughter</i> )
>> AMBER: We got mail!

498
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,654
"This next challenge will prove
harder than the rest,

499
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,532
You'll be rats in the maze
for this little test.

500
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:23,451
Just keep your wits and
you'll make it with ease,

501
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,246
The prize is the idol and that's
much better than cheese."

502
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:30,750
>> JERRI: Oh, a maze!
>> AMBER: I think we should have

503
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,752
a little pep talk.
Well, I think... today, I don't

504
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,463
think it's our strength is going
to get us through this

505
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,299
challenge.
I honestly think it's our minds

506
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,635
and our hearts, and if we all
believe we can do it.

507
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:43,972
I definitely think we can.
So just make sure that you don't

508
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,266
doubt your heart and your mind
at all today, and I think that

509
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,643
will get us through it.
>> JERRI: There's a lot of

510
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:53,648
pressure on us today-- a lot.
But let's not forget also to

511
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:56,901
have fun with this.
>> COLBY: It is going to take

512
00:28:56,985 --> 00:29:00,947
every ounce of keenness, of
smarts, of strength, of

513
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:04,659
everything we have.
The excuses are done, check them

514
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:07,829
at the door and let's get down
to business.

515
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,123
It is going to be one hell of a
show today and it's... you know,

516
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,958
I think we're as ready as we're
going to be.

517
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,836
>> JERRI: All right, Ogabkor.
Here we go!

518
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:24,888
Let's do this!
>> JEFF: I'll take that.

519
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:36,024
Let's do this!
>> JEFF: I'll take that.

520
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:39,652
Once again, give it up, Varner.
The immunity idol is back up for

521
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,989
grabs.
Here's the deal today:

522
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:47,327
A giant maze.
46 tons of lumber, three miles

523
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:51,414
of burlap, two weeks to build.
Each maze is identical.

524
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:54,876
Inside each maze, five totem
poles-- attached to each totem

525
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,379
pole are these medallions.
They're numbered, one, two,

526
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,549
three, four, five.
Working as a unit, your goal

527
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,009
is to get through the maze,
collecting the medallions in

528
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:07,055
order.
One first, then two, then three.

529
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,015
If you find five first, don't
grab it.

530
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,934
Once you've collected all five,
get out of the maze on the other

531
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:14,562
side.
First tribe to the immunity

532
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:18,566
idol wins immunity.
It's about 110 degrees today.

533
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,069
Should work up a nice lather.
Kucha, because there's no

534
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:24,197
obvious advantage or
disadvantage to having more

535
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,449
members in this, you'll run the
full seven.

536
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,035
All right, we'll get going.
>> ALL: One, two, three, Ogakor!

537
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,245
>> ALL: Kucha!
>> JEFF: All right, immunity at

538
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:33,581
stake!
Survivors ready...

539
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:45,635
Go!
>> COLBY: Go back, go back.

540
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:52,934
>> TINA: Go back, go back.
>> KEITH: Dead end-- go back, go

541
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,645
back.
>> Straight-- this way.

542
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,397
>> NICK: I see one, I see one,
I just don't know how to get

543
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,775
there.
There's two.

544
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:01,609
There's two in the far right
corner.

545
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,778
Keep moving on--
this way, this way.

546
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:04,946
We all together?
>> Yeah.

547
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,990
>> All right.
>> COLBY: Work around to the

548
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:11,286
right.
>> Right here.

549
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:15,957
>> COLBY: Got it, got one.
Two is over there.

550
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:24,841
Go!
>> JEFF V.: No, it's right here.

551
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:29,429
One! One! One!
Okay, where was two?

552
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,848
>> Far right corner.
>> Far right corner.

553
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:37,979
>> This way, this way!
No, to the left, this way.

554
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,189
>> I'm right here!
>> He's over here!

555
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,525
>> No, you're going nowhere!
It's this way!

556
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,988
>> Come here, come here.
Is somebody here?

557
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,448
>> COLBY: We found three.
>> No...

558
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,782
>> All right, it's got to be in
the back corner.

559
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:50,992
>> Back up?
>> Back, all the way in the

560
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:51,868
corner.
Go... come on.

561
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,953
>> Here we go, here we go, here
we go.

562
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,580
>> Jeff!
>> I got two right here.

563
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:58,291
>> Go, go, go.
>> Good job, good job.

564
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:00,376
>> Yeah, we lost three...
>> Three's back that way...

565
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,171
>> Go, go, go.
>> Other way-- right there.

566
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,007
>> Straight? Straight.
>> Right there.

567
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,677
>> KEITH: It's right in here.
Come back.

568
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,055
It's right here.
This... Right there.

569
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,474
Go around this way.
>> JERRI: That's three.

570
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,684
>> KEITH: Four is in the front
right corner, five is in the

571
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,187
middle.
Come on, Amber.

572
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:23,483
>> Go, Keith, go.
>> Go on, go on, go on, go on!

573
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,485
>> NICK: Mike, I think we got to
go all the way back down.

574
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,195
>> Yeah, that way.
>> Go all the way down...

575
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,029
(<i> all talking</i> )
>> JERRI: Come on, you guys,

576
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,989
we got it.
>> Left?

577
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:33,326
>> Yeah!
>> COLBY: I see it.

578
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,912
It's right there.
>> AMBER: Right here, guys!

579
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,373
>> Go, go, go, go.
All right, all right.

580
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:43,711
>> Yeah...
>> Go, go!

581
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,508
>> MICHAEL: I got it, I got it.
Got it, got it, got it.

582
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,885
No, no, no, right here.
It's right here.

583
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:52,178
We just gotta get there from
that way.

584
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,888
It's right there.
We got to get to it from

585
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:55,014
that side, though.
>> NICK: Can't we go around that

586
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,016
way?
>> AMBER: Where is it?

587
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,936
Here it is!
>> Go, go.

588
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:03,064
>> Which way?
>> It's that way...

589
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,608
This is it, this is it.
We gotta go.

590
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,027
>> COLBY: Tina, don't get lost!
Tina, Tina, come here!

591
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,405
>> TINA: Okay, I see your flag!
>> Come back, Tina.

592
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,782
>> No, dead end, dead end!
>> Turn around!

593
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,158
>> I'm right behind you!
>> Come on...

594
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:17,412
Come on!
>> I'm here, I'm here.

595
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,914
>> TINA: We're here.
>> Go, go!

596
00:33:19,997 --> 00:33:23,209
>> TINA: We're out!
We're out!

597
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,085
>> Come on!
Go, go, go!

598
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:27,797
Hurry up!
(<i> screaming</i> )

599
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:35,263
>> COLBY: Yes!
(<i> cheering, whooping</i> )

600
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,641
>> JEFF: Yesterday, sitting in
the water, Amber, tears rolling

601
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:41,519
down your face, you said, "I'm
sick of losing."

602
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:44,439
>> AMBER: Do you see any tears
right now?

603
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,648
If they were, they'd be tears of
joy.

604
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:55,116
>> JEFF: Congratulations!
All right, guys, you can head

605
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,994
back.
Kucha, see you tonight at the

606
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:08,171
Tribal Council.
>> ALICIA: Exactly, that's the

607
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:28,316
Tribal Council.
>> ALICIA: Exactly, that's the

608
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,818
only way.
>> JEFF V.: You get on my

609
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,653
nerves, and I don't care...
>> ALICIA: I know, sweetie.

610
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,155
>> JEFF V.: Stickin' to it.
We are not a happy tribe.

611
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:37,158
We are not the family we
appear to be.

612
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,411
There is some animosity.
>> ALICIA: She causes so much

613
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:41,788
trouble within the tribe, as
well.

614
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,039
>> JEFF V.: That's a name I'm
going to be happy to write down.

615
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:47,043
>> ALICIA: Yeah, me, too.
>> KIMMI: I'm sure Jeff and

616
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:50,213
Alicia are gonna vote together,
and you've been spending a lot

617
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,173
of time with them-- I figure you
guys are going to vote together,

618
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,133
>> MICHAEL: Who?
>> KIMMI: You, Alicia and Jeff.

619
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,052
>> MICHAEL: I'm not in their
pact.

620
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:59,514
I'm not in their thing.
>> ALICIA: Tribal Council is a

621
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,891
drag, no matter which way you
look at it.

622
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:05,019
It's clear-cut who should go,
but they stay a little longer

623
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,523
and then somebody steps up and
looks like they should go.

624
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,859
So, for me, Kimmi is a physical
weakness, and she just makes the

625
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,863
most sense right now, because I
have personal problems with her.

626
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:19,742
We just clash.
>> RODGER: It could be very

627
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:24,163
interesting, Tribal Council.
Right now, I assume that they

628
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,833
think that I'm voting against
Kimmi.

629
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:30,878
More than likely, that probably
will not be the case.

630
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,297
The only person that I keep my
word with out here is Elisabeth,

631
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:39,345
and I think she's the same way
towards me.

632
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,889
>> ELISABETH: I took a little
siesta and I said, it ticked me

633
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:45,226
off that you would just complain
to everyone else, and not say

634
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,104
something to Kimmi, just 'cause
you're afraid you'll get a vote.

635
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:51,274
I'm, like, if it's bothering you
that much, I don't want to hear

636
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,359
it, tell Kimmi.
>> RODGER: Mm-hmm.

637
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,867
In the boat today, we were
talking about voting against

638
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:05,454
Alicia.
And we would miss her, she does

639
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:12,753
a good job cooking, you know...
she's athletic... and, uh...

640
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,298
but there might be a little bit
more harmony around, too.

641
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,392
>> ELISABETH: Ready?
>> Let's go.

642
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:30,980
(<i> thunder rumbling</i> )
>> NICK: That thunder's coming

643
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:33,399
in.
>> RODGER: Don't like that.

644
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:10,978
>> JEFF: Welcome back.
I haven't really had a chance to

645
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,648
talk to you guys since Debb was
voted out in the first Tribal

646
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,358
Council.
Haven't been back.

647
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:19,779
Michael, last time you were
here, Rodger sort of, kind of

648
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,323
confirmed that you were sort of
the leader of the group.

649
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,284
Or you had taken that position.
>> MICHAEL: You know, everybody

650
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,954
has taken a leadership role in
this camp in one way, shape or

651
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:31,332
form.
It happened to be that food

652
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,876
seemed to be on the top of the
charts and I was bringing in

653
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,797
fish.
And so, you know, I possibly was

654
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,508
anointed the leader by Rodger
that day.

655
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,344
But everybody on this team has
contributed in their own way in

656
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:47,181
equal amount, and that's why
we've been so strong.

657
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:49,392
(<i> thunder rumbles, rain falls</i> )
>> JEFF: Well, as always, it

658
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,519
seems like when you guys are
here, we get the rain coming

659
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,772
down.
And there go the caps.

660
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:58,025
Alicia, talk to me about
leadership, because for me,

661
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,028
looking in, I would say you seem
to be a strong leader on this

662
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,572
tribe as well.
>> ALICIA: I don't know about

663
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,241
that.
I'm not so sure I'm a leader as

664
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:09,662
much as maybe a motivator.
I like to make sure that

665
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:13,165
everybody is on the same page.
I think if we're all on the same

666
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,042
page, especially going into a
challenge, there's no way we're

667
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,252
going to lose.
>> JEFF: What's your biggest

668
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:19,547
contribution?
>> ALICIA: I think my motivation

669
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,424
for everybody is probably my
biggest contribution.

670
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:24,593
I'm used to doing that back home
with my job as a personal

671
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,722
trainer, motivating people, and
I think it just comes naturally

672
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:31,267
to me, in any kind of situation,
to take on that motivation role.

673
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:35,229
And that's what I do, or at
least I try to.

674
00:38:35,312 --> 00:38:37,440
>> JEFF: Kimmi, I've seen you in
action.

675
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,442
Where are you feeling in the
tribe right now, as we come to a

676
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:42,236
vote?
>> KIMMI: I don't know, just

677
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:44,530
like with anything, it could
depend on the day or the

678
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:49,243
weather, you know, what goes
through your head.

679
00:38:49,326 --> 00:38:51,787
'Cause, every day, you feel
close to somebody and then you

680
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:56,083
feel a little bit separated,
and it's, um... it's weird.

681
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,086
>> JEFF: All right, guys.
Behind me, four torches.

682
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,297
Debb is the only one familiar to
you guys and another one is

683
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,800
going to be added to that pile
in a few minutes.

684
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,553
Let's do it.
Michael, you're up first.

685
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:37,333
>> KIMMI: This really should be
Alicia, but I hear other people

686
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:47,426
are voting for Jeff.
>> ALICIA: My vote is for Kimmi.

687
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:59,438
are voting for Jeff.
>> ALICIA: My vote is for Kimmi.

688
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,983
She and I have not got along
from the beginning, and the

689
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,570
whole food thing is really
becoming an issue that separates

690
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,823
her from the rest of the tribe,
so I think it's time to let her

691
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:20,459
go.
>> ELISABETH: We need to keep

692
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:24,672
our tribe strong and there's too
much split going on, so, for

693
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,299
a strong Kucha, it's the best
vote.

694
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,605
>> JEFF: I'll go tally the
votes.

695
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:57,538
Once the votes are tallied, the
decision is final.

696
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:58,706
The person will be asked to
leave the Tribal Council area

697
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,041
immediately.
I'm going to read them.

698
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:12,219
First vote...
Kimmi.

699
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:16,640
Next vote...
Kimmi.

700
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:32,531
That's three votes: Kimmi.
Four votes.

701
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,366
No need to read the rest.
Kimmi, you need to bring me your

702
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,536
torch.
>> KIMMI: Okay, bye, guys.

703
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:49,506
>> JEFF: The tribe and Mother
Nature have spoken.

704
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:55,137
Time for you to go.
>> KIMMI: Which way?

705
00:41:55,221 --> 00:42:03,646
Go get 'em, guys.
>> JEFF: Well, the good news is:

706
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:08,275
you survived Tribal Council.
The bad news is: this is what

707
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,445
you get to sleep in.
Have a good long walk home.

708
00:42:11,528 --> 00:42:14,031
Grab your torches, I'll see you
tomorrow.

709
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,468
>> JEFF: Stay tuned for scenes
from next time, and hear what

710
00:42:34,551 --> 00:42:39,974
Kimmi has to say.
Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>

711
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,768
(<i> man screaming</i> )
When the unthinkable happens at

712
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:47,147
Kucha, the tribe realizes
survival in the outback is not

713
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:50,484
just a game.
>> JERRI: "There has been an

714
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:52,945
accident at the Kucha camp."
>> COLBY: Oh, my God.

715
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:55,948
>> ELISABETH: And it just really
hit hard.

716
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:06,292
>> KIMMI: I knew for a long time
that my head was on the chopping

717
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:10,754
block.
It doesn't surprise me at all.

718
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,841
I'm glad that I stayed true to
myself and my morals.

719
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,634
Um, I know that Alicia and I
have not gotten along since day

720
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:19,346
one.
If that's what they felt that

721
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,682
they had to do, then, you know,
power to the team.
