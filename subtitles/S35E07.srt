1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,370
Previously on Survivor...

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,500
In the Yawa tribe, 
three Healers, one Hero

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,150
and a Fighter 
remained undefeated.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,340
Good game !

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,670
In the Levu tribe, 
things were going well for Joe.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,720
The idol!

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,220
Bon sang!

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:24,320
In the Soko tribe, 
JP and Ali were in danger.

9
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,500
Ryan and I have to choose

10
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,540
which of the two leaves tonight.

11
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,320
At the council, 
Chrissy and Ryan eliminated Ali.

12
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,140
Ali, the tribe has spoken.

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,920
There are 12 left. 
Who will be eliminated tonight?

14
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,300
I didn't want to smile,

15
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,900
it was sad that she was leaving 
and I felt sorry for her,

16
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,500
but I was happy for us, 
it was hard not to smile.

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,500
She had to leave.

18
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,440
I play 24 hours a day.

19
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:10,150
I believe I dominate the social game 
in this tribe.

20
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,240
The two guys are closer 
to me than to each other.

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,270
Wow, we held one more. 
Yeah.

22
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,420
The first two thirds!

23
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,750
It makes my position 
very comfortable.

24
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,250
Perhaps the dominant position.

25
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:27,520
My current position 
prepares me for a bright future.

26
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,690
If there is a test today, 
we win.

27
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,900
I feel good 
with my five from Yawa.

28
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,850
We fully trust each other 
now.

29
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,820
Because we've been through 
tough times together.

30
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,870
Ben's a good guy, 
and Lauren should stay with us.

31
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,870
And with Mike and Jessica, 
we come from the Healers.

32
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,520
We have this link 
from the previous tribe.

33
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,650
If this group stays together, 
we can accomplish a lot,

34
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,120
and I doubt the others 
have the same unit.

35
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,590
I don't see the other tribes 
staying so united.

36
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,800
Just. 
So...

37
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,870
We are five.

38
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,390
And at the merger, we should be 
able to recruit Joe and Desi.

39
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,620
We'll have to have a solid pact.

40
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,720
We gotta make a plan, execute it

41
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,140
and stick to it.

42
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,790
If, at the merger, we are five welded,

43
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,790
It will be alright.

44
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,750
But it's mostly Cole 
that worries me.

45
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,840
Cole and Jess 
have sex every night.

46
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,240
It makes trust difficult.

47
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,150
It has to improve. 
There, we are the broken tribe.

48
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:50,020
We're two against two, 
Devon and me against Joe and Desi.

49
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,490
But above all, 
physically, we are exhausted.

50
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,090
Our stomachs are empty, 
we can feel it.

51
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,700
We have nothing left to eat, 
no more rice,

52
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:09,070
no chicken, no fruit, 
no vegetables, nothing.

53
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,590
I'm too hungry.

54
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,670
Except for a small amount of sugar.

55
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:18,840
Sugar at breakfast.

56
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,850
Survivor is no joke. 
We're not joking saying

57
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,440
that without food today, 
we could die.

58
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,270
He struggles to move forward.

59
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,890
You can do it, Dev!

60
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,120
I'm spinning.

61
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,740
There are no longer any calories 
my body can use.

62
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,720
My brain seems dead

63
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,090
and each of my limbs 
weighs a ton.

64
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,720
It's the saddest moment 
of my life.

65
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,920
Right here right now.

66
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,000
This game is way more real 
than I thought

67
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,220
and at the next 
reward event,

68
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,790
If we don't win, 
I don't know what I'll do.

69
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,890
Over here, everyone!

70
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,240
Wow, Desi, that's laborious.

71
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,140
Yawa, Levu, 
discover the new Soko tribe.

72
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,670
Ali was eliminated 
at the last council.

73
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,590
Desi, to see you climb 
these few meters of sand,

74
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,240
it looked 
like you were climbing Everest.

75
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,270
Is this representative 
of wear after 17 days?

76
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,450
Absolutely. 
We have nothing to eat at the camp.

77
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,650
Not a single calorie. 
I want to eat.

78
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,020
And how !

79
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,320
We are all there.

80
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,850
All tired, all hungry.

81
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,520
So what are we waiting for, Jeff?

82
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,900
All right, shall we get to it? 
Yes.

83
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,520
Well, first of all...

84
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,520
Throw away all your bandanas.

85
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,520
It's fusion!

86
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:34,020
It is an indescribable pleasure. 
We all want to achieve fusion.

87
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,090
This is where Survivor begins.

88
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,740
I am Mike. 
How are you, Mike?

89
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,770
This is where you discover 
your true allies,

90
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,000
but you have to 
have your head in the game.

91
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,540
The merger is the first step 
towards the million.

92
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,920
I really hope 
it involves food.

93
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,420
Joe, delighted.

94
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,020
New bandannas!

95
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,070
Have you ever seen 
so much love at a merger?

96
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,700
It's not bad, I like it.

97
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,730
Sweet music to my ears, 
when Jeff said:

98
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:28,800
"Throw away your bandanas!"

99
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,150
I think I am in a good place. 
I have people with the Healers.

100
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,680
The Healers are five.

101
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,870
There are only four Heroes 
and three Fighters.

102
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,550
As a bonus, 
everyone is unaware that I have an idol.

103
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,870
So there, I'm excited.

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,070
Where's the food ?

105
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,270
And the scary part?

106
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,570
There is a "but".

107
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,530
Doctor Mike, immediately 
everyone says:

108
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,950
"And the feast?" 
and "There is a 'but'!"

109
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,500
What is the dominant feeling?

110
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,370
Are you worried that things won't go 
as usual?

111
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,400
35th season of Survivor. 
You never know what will happen.

112
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,150
That's right.

113
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,800
And typically... 
Oh, my God.

114
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,620
... At the merger, you are entitled

115
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,670
to a big feast at Survivor. 
Yes !

116
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,850
But not today. 
Do not say that !

117
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,070
Because we have better.

118
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,470
What what ?

119
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,370
We brought 
Outback Steakhouse to Fiji.

120
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,320
Give me that steak! 
Give me that steak!

121
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,850
Yes, the steak kings 
are going to take care of the fusion feast.

122
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,200
And since Outback Steakhouse 
operates the Australian way,

123
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,020
or "No rules, 
just what's good.",

124
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,170
this meat cut on the bone,

125
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,420
these entrecôtes... 
Entrecôte, entrecôte!

126
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,600
Sorry. Sorry, Jeff.

127
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,330
Do you like entrecote? 
That's what I prefer.

128
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,250
They will be prepared 
according to your wishes,

129
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,850
individually cooked the way you like it 
.

130
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:02,100
In addition, potatoes 
and all the accompaniment: salad...

131
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,250
And the chocolate fudge? 
Are there any?

132
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,430
The authentic 
Chocolate Thunder.

133
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,950
But yes !

134
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,700
Bonus: cold beer 
and Gold Coast Rita.

135
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,100
Outback Steakhouse is waiting for you 
right back there.

136
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,050
Good afternoon !

137
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,370
I needed this fusion so badly!

138
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,500
My tribe was a disaster. 
We are only three.

139
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,980
Achieving fusion, we dream of it.

140
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,450
Here it gets serious.

141
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,050
Oh my God !

142
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,650
You believe in it ?!

143
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,730
Rib to bone.

144
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,750
I'll take it all.

145
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,730
Welcome to Outback Steakhouse!

146
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,850
Thanks. 
Have a drink!

147
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,150
Oh my God ! It was ecstasy!

148
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,150
To the merger!

149
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,000
Achieving fusion 
is such an accomplishment!

150
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,580
Going from this morning's depression 
to the company of these great people,

151
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,720
and having this feast 
was such a joy!

152
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,080
I feel like a king. 
That is living!

153
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,470
Well, give me everything!

154
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,630
No, I... 
What cooking, the rib?

155
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,550
Can I have two steaks?

156
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,570
Yes you can. 
Give me two!

157
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,850
Thanks a lot.

158
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,500
I normally eat 
8,000 calories a day.

159
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,750
So before the merge, 
I was in "survival" mode.

160
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,880
"I want to eat !" And there, after 
almost three weeks of hunger,

161
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,400
Wow !

162
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,570
The steak falls off the bone

163
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,330
and melts in your mouth. 
This is a dream.

164
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,850
Oh my God ! Too good !

165
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,650
Best steak of my life. 
Unbelievable.

166
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,050
If Survivor is a mountain, 
I'm halfway there.

167
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,800
That's how you conquer 
a peak: one step at a time.

168
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,300
Cole, I don't want 
you to pass out. Eat more!

169
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,350
Can we recommend steaks?!

170
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,680
I ordered 
three desserts and two steaks.

171
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,000
Sorry.

172
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,330
This is my first opportunity 
to meet Joe.

173
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:07,920
And I'm really happy 
to have spent all this time without him.

174
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,750
He is very noisy 
and really unpleasant.

175
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,900
Tell us the advice. 
I expected this question.

176
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,050
Well, I had to release an idol.

177
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,250
Where did you get it from?

178
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,580
Blue or yellow? 
Yellow.

179
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,500
Really ? 
You are the 1st to know it.

180
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,620
The cow !

181
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,500
Joe tells us there was 
an idol that was played.

182
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,520
But does Joe have a second idol, 
that of Levu?

183
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,330
Chocolate Thunder.

184
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,670
My God !

185
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,230
I believe that I love you.

186
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,680
This Aussie waiter 
brings me a Chocolate Tonnerre.

187
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,180
I thought, 
"You'll do me good down there."

188
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,150
Not the kind of thing 
I often say.

189
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,270
Being a virgin, I try 
to stay moral and holy.

190
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,430
Oh my God !

191
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,500
Came out of the joy 
and excitement of the steaks,

192
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,700
the game quickly regains its rights.

193
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,730
The goal in the merger was to remain 
the five Yawa until the end.

194
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,120
Namely Lauren, Mike, 
Cole, Ben and me.

195
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,200
But the majority requires 
at least two other people.

196
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,230
We should be able to recruit 
the ex-Healers: Joe and Desi.

197
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,700
We'll see if it works.

198
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,420
As long as no 
one leaves the alliance,

199
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,480
Everything will be alright.

200
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,370
Ah! Very good.

201
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,900
Fusion !

202
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,120
I'm glad to see you again. 
I say. I was worried.

203
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,600
Yes everything is fine.

204
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,730
Only Joe worries me.

205
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,550
I'm afraid that in Levu,

206
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,050
he found another idol.

207
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,700
Yes. They are listening to us here.

208
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,480
They don't hear me. 
Too much wind.

209
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,100
I say.

210
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,800
Before mixing, 
Chrissy and I were close.

211
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,170
But no one knows 
we worked together.

212
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,500
And she was talking to me 
in front of everyone.

213
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,970
It's worrying, 
because I don't want

214
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,320
to be seen as allies.

215
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,550
You are my number one.

216
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,250
We'll talk at camp.

217
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,850
In secret.

218
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,800
The merger being there, 
everyone starts from scratch.

219
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,520
And we have to anticipate.

220
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,000
There are no more teams. 
Only me and my family matter.

221
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:04,750
From now on, camaraderie is over.

222
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,330
It will be betrayals, lies,

223
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,450
and I'm sure 
someone will crack.

224
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,480
Look at all this! 
It's a new world.

225
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,820
It's incredible.

226
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,630
The goal was to achieve fusion.

227
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,780
And arrived at the camp, it is as if 
we had received a new life,

228
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,880
a chance to start over.

229
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,880
We have hammers, 
several machetes

230
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,250
and even huge nails.

231
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,200
We can build a great shelter.

232
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,450
But at this stage, 
the cards are reshuffled.

233
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,300
People think of themselves first.

234
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,550
So I thought 
we should look

235
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,420
a clue or advantage.

236
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,980
But I found nothing.

237
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,100
I have to keep looking.

238
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,630
Because people 
will talk to each other,

239
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,600
plot, strategize, 
create new alliances.

240
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:11,050
Did Joe talk 
about all staying together?

241
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,730
Yes, he still wants it. 
OK.

242
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,250
What do you think ?

243
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,930
Let's keep it as long as it serves us. 
Exactly.

244
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,500
I spoke with Desi 
and was delighted to hear

245
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,620
that she and Joe 
were still working together.

246
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,300
So I have all the Healers 
plus Lauren and Ben from Yawa.

247
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,650
And that's a majority.

248
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:33,250
I feel 
like the queen bee.

249
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,550
Happy to see you. 
I was worried the last time.

250
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,550
It was... unanimous? 
I was nervous too.

251
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,820
I'm waiting to talk to Dev again 
from the mix.

252
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,720
It's like 
finding an old friend.

253
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,620
I wish 
it was you, me, JP...

254
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,630
Ashley. 
Are you close to JP?

255
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,450
Yes, we voted together both times. 
Good.

256
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,880
So... 
You, me, Lauren...

257
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,450
Us and the Heroes.

258
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,920
A Hero-Fighters alliance makes 
sense to us,

259
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,970
because alas, 
there are only three Wings left.

260
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,150
Lauren, Devon and me.

261
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:08,700
But I'm close 
to two Heroes, JP and Chrissy.

262
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,350
So it would be a perfect match.

263
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,850
It's Heroes and Fighters 
versus Healers.

264
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,430
It's okay with me. 
Yeah.

265
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:18,550
Fusion Vote is 
Survivor's crème de la crème.

266
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:23,570
It determines 
who will control the rest of the game.

267
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,850
And a Fighter does not wait, 
he will form alliances.

268
00:14:37,246 --> 00:14:39,516
We are all good 
at challenges.

269
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,996
Lord ! 
Without energy in reserve!

270
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:45,000
To see this group of 12,

271
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,066
I believe that they are the best 
who have reached fusion.

272
00:14:49,446 --> 00:14:51,896
But Healers and Heroes

273
00:14:52,446 --> 00:14:54,946
see each other as antagonists 
from the start.

274
00:14:55,116 --> 00:14:57,196
We are well placed, know that.

275
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:00,576
We, the Fighters, 
go a little unnoticed.

276
00:15:00,696 --> 00:15:03,196
And at the merger, it is not negative.

277
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:06,616
You and me, we had to fend for 
ourselves, but it turned out well.

278
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,946
We're in the minority 
and they're all going to want us.

279
00:15:10,716 --> 00:15:11,800
talk to people,

280
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,326
but don't give them 
any idea what we're doing.

281
00:15:15,446 --> 00:15:17,526
I had contact 
with everyone.

282
00:15:17,646 --> 00:15:19,796
Let's go with the Heroes. 
Yeah.

283
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,846
We seven, get the five out.

284
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:24,446
Heroes and Fighters 
want to take out the Healers.

285
00:15:24,646 --> 00:15:27,596
No question for me. 
I stay with the Healers.

286
00:15:27,716 --> 00:15:32,696
I really like Doctor Mike 
and I have a pact with the Yawa.

287
00:15:32,816 --> 00:15:36,166
It makes sense 
that the five of us stick together.

288
00:15:36,466 --> 00:15:39,676
Devon's plan 
is that he, Ryan and I,

289
00:15:39,796 --> 00:15:41,696
with the Heroes, 
we take out the Healers.

290
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,246
It's not good for me.

291
00:15:43,366 --> 00:15:45,496
We're 1000% together, swear.

292
00:15:45,746 --> 00:15:46,996
For our children.

293
00:15:47,216 --> 00:15:48,500
Lauren tells me immediately

294
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,246
that Devon wants 
all the ex-Healers out.

295
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:53,396
I made you a promise, Mike.

296
00:15:53,796 --> 00:15:57,166
It worries me that Healers 
might be the target

297
00:15:57,396 --> 00:15:59,696
original Fighters and Heroes.

298
00:15:59,816 --> 00:16:02,646
But in reality, 
the five Healers are welded together,

299
00:16:02,766 --> 00:16:05,866
and I bond with Lauren and Ben.

300
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,996
So the boundaries have been drawn,

301
00:16:09,246 --> 00:16:12,616
and I expect a war.

302
00:16:18,816 --> 00:16:23,616
For me, 3 Fighters 
and 4 Heroes come out the Healers.

303
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:27,196
In my eyes, the best scenario

304
00:16:27,466 --> 00:16:30,316
would be to take out Cole or Joe.

305
00:16:30,496 --> 00:16:31,716
No problem for me.

306
00:16:31,846 --> 00:16:34,346
I just know that I barely 
endured a meal with him.

307
00:16:34,466 --> 00:16:35,166
Yeah.

308
00:16:35,616 --> 00:16:38,046
Joe knows how to play, which makes him

309
00:16:38,346 --> 00:16:39,696
a threat to others.

310
00:16:39,816 --> 00:16:44,900
Cole is a physical threat. 
If he loses the first immunity,

311
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,866
it would be a good time 
for him to leave.

312
00:16:47,116 --> 00:16:50,266
It would be nice 
to be able to be all seven.

313
00:16:52,096 --> 00:16:54,326
For now, 
I listen to everyone.

314
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:58,796
I can go with ex-Heroes 
and ex-Combatants.

315
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,366
Let's pick up some wood, 
like this...

316
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:05,266
Or I can see if it works 
with the five Yawa.

317
00:17:05,596 --> 00:17:08,716
The question is: 
can I trust Cole?

318
00:17:11,816 --> 00:17:13,796
How do you use cinnamon?

319
00:17:14,216 --> 00:17:17,466
It's not bad if you bite it 
rather than eat it.

320
00:17:18,116 --> 00:17:21,066
He's selfish and I doubt 
he respects anyone here.

321
00:17:21,196 --> 00:17:22,766
He only respects himself.

322
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,016
He needs help 
to get to the end, that's all.

323
00:17:25,216 --> 00:17:27,516
But now, I need someone 
I can trust.

324
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,746
Cole is munching 
on cinnamon sticks.

325
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:33,096
What ? 
Yeah.

326
00:17:34,796 --> 00:17:37,626
Cole made some big mistakes, 
especially with the food.

327
00:17:37,746 --> 00:17:39,516
He doesn't think.

328
00:17:39,966 --> 00:17:43,500
And he isolates himself, does not speak to 
the group, eats alone.

329
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,396
We don't do that in Survivor.

330
00:17:45,746 --> 00:17:48,996
But Cole is my number one, 
I feel a connection with him.

331
00:17:49,116 --> 00:17:51,076
We've built 
something great together,

332
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:52,800
and I need him here.

333
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,400
It is therefore time for us to re-discuss.

334
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,696
You have to stop 
eating cinnamon.

335
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:57,796
What are you talking about ?

336
00:17:58,216 --> 00:18:00,726
We watch over you. Do not do it. 
OK ?

337
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,566
Good. Did someone say something? 
Yeah.

338
00:18:02,796 --> 00:18:04,196
Here? 
Well.

339
00:18:04,696 --> 00:18:06,096
Ben. OK.

340
00:18:08,016 --> 00:18:11,696
Devon is 
in for taking out Cole or Joe.

341
00:18:13,696 --> 00:18:15,396
So, well...

342
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:19,200
Leaving Cole would destroy 
the trust between the five.

343
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,296
Yeah.

344
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:23,166
The Yawa tribe said, 
"We stick together at five."

345
00:18:23,446 --> 00:18:26,096
The problem 
is that Ben is hesitant now.

346
00:18:26,216 --> 00:18:28,566
It was just a theory.

347
00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:30,396
OK. 
Nothing definitive.

348
00:18:30,946 --> 00:18:32,476
But Cole 
is the biggest threat.

349
00:18:32,596 --> 00:18:34,326
Let's see one vote at a time.

350
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,376
Sure.

351
00:18:35,496 --> 00:18:37,246
Because here, Cole is one of your five.

352
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:40,696
The post-merger dynamics 
are far from what I imagined.

353
00:18:40,946 --> 00:18:43,966
I imagined being the only one playing.

354
00:18:44,296 --> 00:18:46,646
But it turns out 
that everyone is playing.

355
00:18:47,046 --> 00:18:49,796
It greatly complicates my 
life.

356
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:52,376
Everything we've been working on for 
the past nine days,

357
00:18:52,496 --> 00:18:54,096
we can forget 
it if we take it out first.

358
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,746
It's not 
because I arrived here

359
00:18:56,966 --> 00:18:58,816
with a supposed alliance 
of five...

360
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,816
... that everyone will stick to it.

361
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:04,846
They're all after you.

362
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,350
It's Joe or you.

363
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,026
All Heroes and all Fighters

364
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:09,896
are after you two.

365
00:19:10,146 --> 00:19:11,246
Are you still with me?

366
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,846
Sure. 
You are with me, huh?

367
00:19:13,966 --> 00:19:14,826
100 %.

368
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,026
Now 
that my name is mentioned,

369
00:19:17,146 --> 00:19:19,426
I experience 
Survivor paranoia.

370
00:19:19,546 --> 00:19:22,566
Like in climbing, 
when your gear doesn't hold,

371
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:26,176
you are at the top 
and you will find yourself at the bottom.

372
00:19:26,296 --> 00:19:28,396
And my allies are my gear.

373
00:19:28,716 --> 00:19:30,946
Pray for them to extend 
my life in Survivor.

374
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,853
Over here, everyone!

375
00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:00,350
Good. Ready for your first 
individual immunity test?

376
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:00,910
Yeah.

377
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,950
First of all, Desi and Mike,

378
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,330
I take back the idols.

379
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,900
Tribal immunity is over.

380
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,500
This is what you want 
now.

381
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,850
The individual immunity collar.

382
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,900
With you are safe. 
Without, you are not.

383
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,430
Today you will stand 
on a narrow rail

384
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:30,100
and spin a marble 
in a circular track.

385
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,010
Regularly, 
you will descend along the rail,

386
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,800
increasing the difficulty.

387
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,930
If you lose the ball 
or fall off the rail,

388
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,350
you are eliminated.

389
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:42,250
The last person standing 
wins immunity,

390
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,630
is safe at the council.

391
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:48,030
The losers: someone will be 
the seventh person eliminated.

392
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,330
Good. Take place.

393
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,680
Let's go. 
Let everyone spin their ball.

394
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,630
All the balls spin.

395
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:11,680
Your first individual immunity test 
is launched.

396
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,480
And now Ryan is eliminated,

397
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,080
after only 
a few seconds.

398
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,600
Ryan, go to the bench.

399
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,280
This game can have you 
in so many different ways.

400
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,850
This hypnotic trance 
which is about to begin,

401
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,200
take over your mind, 
this spinning ball...

402
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,630
Don't let her make you forget 
what you're doing.

403
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,630
You are going to make 
your first move.

404
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,830
You will put one foot 
on the rail.

405
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,300
Things get 
a little more difficult.

406
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,400
It is a delicate test.

407
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,550
You've probably 
never done this.

408
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,930
How many people do that 
on Sunday in their garden?

409
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,780
Not even me, Jeff.

410
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,450
Doctor Mike loses his marble.

411
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,010
Mike is eliminated.

412
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,330
More than 10 people.

413
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,010
A whole new test.

414
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:19,150
You will be the first person 
to win it.

415
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:23,700
And the first protected person 
on the board since the merger.

416
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:31,700
Alright, it's time to 
take another step down.

417
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,230
The balance gets 
a little more complicated.

418
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:47,530
Jessica loses her marble. 
There are only nine people left.

419
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,130
Sweat 
runs down Joe's face.

420
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,530
Yes sir ! 
Yes sir !

421
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,100
No way to stop 
to wipe it.

422
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,330
No sir ! 
No sir !

423
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,130
You don't have to 
get distracted.

424
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,830
The concentration needed 
in the game

425
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,630
is also for this test.

426
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,800
Keep that marble 
moving!

427
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,810
Alright, it's time to 
take another step down.

428
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:21,330
You will put one foot 
on the narrowest part.

429
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,350
Take small steps.

430
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,280
Ben is in trouble.

431
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,180
Ben does not manage 
to finish advancing, it is lost.

432
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,230
JP loses his ball. He is eliminated.

433
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,130
Devon is eliminated. 
More than six people.

434
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:48,560
Lauren loses her marble 
right after Devon. More than five.

435
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,200
This third section 
is wreaking havoc.

436
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,050
Nice recovery from Cole.

437
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,400
This sound should not mislead you.

438
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,030
He wants to seduce you, put you to sleep.

439
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,430
Joe loses his ball. 
More than four people.

440
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,400
Fighting for immunity.

441
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,500
Tap into your last 
reserves! Hold fast !

442
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,680
Your chances increase, 
with each spin,

443
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,450
to be the person 
who will win the event.

444
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,950
ELAPSED TIME: 10 Minutes

445
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,450
Cole struggles to stay in the game.

446
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:51,830
Cole loses his marble.

447
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:54,030
He is eliminated.

448
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,650
And immediately... Chrissy loses her marble. 
More than two people.

449
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,730
Desi and Ashley 
fight over immunity.

450
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,200
Desi's ball goes slow, 
Ashley's twice as fast.

451
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,180
Different strategies. 
Both are walking.

452
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,550
You just have to 
keep your ball moving.

453
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,110
First 
individual immunity test.

454
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,230
With a big tip on the horizon.

455
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:32,330
It's now been 30 minutes. 
ELAPSED TIME: 30 Minutes<br>

456
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,280
To put that into perspective,

457
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,000
Ryan was the first eliminated,

458
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,350
after two seconds.

459
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,610
Who is good at math?

460
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:47,900
How many times longer 
did they last than Ryan?

461
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,730
It's been 30 minutes? 900 times.

462
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:58,500
And Desi and Ashley continue.

463
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,150
38 minutes. 
ELAPSED TIME: 38 Minutes<br>

464
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,530
Chrissy, 
how many times has Ryan been?

465
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,030
1100 and some.

466
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:13,600
You lasted 1,100 times 
longer than Ryan.

467
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,400
Put that on your resume.

468
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,400
I will do it.

469
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:21,080
Well, it's time 
to move on to sudden death.

470
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,200
Both feet will be 
on the narrowest part.

471
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,880
Three, two, one...

472
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,900
Ashley moves 
inch by inch.

473
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,430
Desi wobbles.

474
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:42,160
Ashley fails and loses her marble.

475
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,880
Desi wins 
first individual immunity!

476
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,330
Safe at tonight's council.

477
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,900
Well done, Ash. 
Girls, you rock!

478
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,650
Great, girls!

479
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,450
Desi, come here.

480
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,450
First person 
to wear this necklace.

481
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,010
Immunity is yours. 
Safe at tonight's council.

482
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,780
You cannot be eliminated.

483
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,250
As for you guys, 
after 19 rough days,

484
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,360
someone will be 
the seventh person eliminated.

485
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,080
It won't be you. 
Take your things, leave.

486
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,730
See you tonight at the council. 
Congratulation.

487
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:23,780
At the first merger vote, 
it is crucial

488
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,000
to eliminate a threat. 
And there are plenty of them.

489
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:31,280
It is time for this alliance 
of Heroes and Fighters

490
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,900
assembles 
and attempts to take out a Healer.

491
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:52,797
Wow, Desi and Ashley, that was...

492
00:27:52,997 --> 00:27:54,547
Impressive. 
Downright.

493
00:27:55,547 --> 00:27:56,347
Good job.

494
00:27:56,547 --> 00:27:57,517
I am very worried.

495
00:27:57,697 --> 00:27:59,477
My name 
has been maliciously mentioned.

496
00:27:59,597 --> 00:28:01,717
I have a good chance 
of leaving tonight.

497
00:28:01,867 --> 00:28:04,947
Apparently, my eating habits 
displease.

498
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:07,277
I'm looking for a way out.

499
00:28:07,397 --> 00:28:09,167
I'll see what I can do.

500
00:28:12,517 --> 00:28:13,847
I would like to apologise.

501
00:28:14,297 --> 00:28:16,917
I know I've annoyed you 
with food in the past.

502
00:28:18,767 --> 00:28:21,727
Yes. I know you don't have 
fat stores...

503
00:28:21,847 --> 00:28:23,447
That's not an excuse. 
Exactly.

504
00:28:23,597 --> 00:28:25,717
That's what I was going to say.

505
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:30,147
I didn't want to say it 
publicly and be the bad guy.

506
00:28:30,797 --> 00:28:32,127
But I would have liked to.

507
00:28:32,247 --> 00:28:34,527
'Cause I do this without thinking

508
00:28:34,647 --> 00:28:35,997
how it is perceived.

509
00:28:36,117 --> 00:28:38,127
I'm sorry, and never...

510
00:28:38,247 --> 00:28:40,327
And the blow of the fish. 
You bring it, you catch it,

511
00:28:40,447 --> 00:28:42,567
and you eat it alone.

512
00:28:43,017 --> 00:28:44,727
I don't think about it.

513
00:28:44,847 --> 00:28:46,517
I know, friend. No problem.

514
00:28:46,967 --> 00:28:49,047
Cole apologized, 
and I played it:

515
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:51,667
"No worries, everything is fine."

516
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,377
He offended me the whole time 
we shared on camp.

517
00:28:54,497 --> 00:28:57,147
I appreciate that you have 
the maturity to assume.

518
00:28:57,267 --> 00:28:59,147
It's a first step.

519
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:02,227
But going against the ex-Yawa

520
00:29:02,347 --> 00:29:04,847
and eliminating Cole 
might hurt me later.

521
00:29:04,967 --> 00:29:06,547
Cool ? 
Yes, I said it all.

522
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:07,777
Okay, buddy. I appreciate.

523
00:29:07,897 --> 00:29:10,977
I have to think tactically, 
not emotionally.

524
00:29:11,097 --> 00:29:14,447
Tactically speaking, 
if I have to collaborate with Cole

525
00:29:14,567 --> 00:29:16,747
to advance in the game, 
I will.

526
00:29:20,017 --> 00:29:21,847
My name is mentioned. 
Yours or mine?

527
00:29:22,517 --> 00:29:23,467
I heard both.

528
00:29:24,047 --> 00:29:25,047
Without wanting to brag,

529
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:26,867
I should be worried.

530
00:29:27,317 --> 00:29:29,697
In terms of strategy, I see things 
before others.

531
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,877
So I understand.

532
00:29:30,997 --> 00:29:33,177
I am aware that I 
can be targeted.

533
00:29:33,297 --> 00:29:35,667
I am a solid player, 
strategy level.

534
00:29:35,867 --> 00:29:38,647
I found an idol. 
It terrifies people.

535
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:40,400
Please don't use it against me 
.

536
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,597
But no.

537
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:47,167
Ben, Jessica, Mike, 
Lauren and I, the red tribe,

538
00:29:47,417 --> 00:29:51,897
we have a kind of pact. 
We vote together.

539
00:29:54,647 --> 00:29:55,947
Let me ask you a question.

540
00:29:56,067 --> 00:29:58,077
Why include Ben, damn it?

541
00:29:58,197 --> 00:29:59,647
He will betray you.

542
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:00,997
Ben is playing a double game.

543
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:02,927
My Healer tribe 
has been compromised.

544
00:30:03,047 --> 00:30:07,200
They get manipulated by Ben.

545
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,817
You never went to the council.

546
00:30:09,747 --> 00:30:11,147
Joe goes wild, at the council.

547
00:30:12,797 --> 00:30:13,677
This is where I excel.

548
00:30:13,797 --> 00:30:15,797
But if I feel in danger, 
I have an idol.

549
00:30:15,917 --> 00:30:18,847
As for using it for me 
or for someone else,

550
00:30:18,967 --> 00:30:21,317
I will decide at the last moment.

551
00:30:24,817 --> 00:30:27,377
Talk to me. I feel 
awfully left out.

552
00:30:27,497 --> 00:30:30,167
I heard Heroes 
would target Healers.

553
00:30:30,697 --> 00:30:31,517
I feel like...

554
00:30:31,967 --> 00:30:33,597
...that we have to vote for Chrissy.

555
00:30:35,197 --> 00:30:38,147
Having Chrissy in the game 
is very dangerous.

556
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:39,977
She knows how to speak. 
Yeah.

557
00:30:40,097 --> 00:30:41,197
She is super smart.

558
00:30:41,317 --> 00:30:44,117
She made these calculations 
as if it were nothing.

559
00:30:44,497 --> 00:30:47,397
Chrissy has to go first, 
because in this game,

560
00:30:47,517 --> 00:30:49,027
we must eliminate 
very clever people.

561
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:52,047
The kings of manipulation. 
So tonight

562
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:54,297
we'll be five Healers 
against Chrissy.

563
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:57,147
And I think 
Lauren will vote with us.

564
00:30:57,517 --> 00:30:58,880
So now we are six.

565
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,647
Lauren approached us.

566
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:03,417
We were five 
and we all became close.

567
00:31:03,617 --> 00:31:05,467
We trust each other. 
And then ?

568
00:31:06,417 --> 00:31:08,377
Exactly. 
He says he's with us, but...

569
00:31:08,497 --> 00:31:10,797
He also found his Heroes.

570
00:31:11,067 --> 00:31:15,517
The question becomes: 
"Is Ben with or against us?"

571
00:31:19,717 --> 00:31:22,117
We have to stick 
to our five-way plan.

572
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,447
And I... 
A Healer has to come out first.

573
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:27,797
You think ? 
Oh yeah.

574
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:30,097
But we are fine with them.

575
00:31:30,217 --> 00:31:32,617
We must not spoil this. 
I don't trust Cole.

576
00:31:33,247 --> 00:31:35,167
I say. Me too.

577
00:31:35,317 --> 00:31:36,717
But listen to me, honey.

578
00:31:37,847 --> 00:31:38,717
Look at me.

579
00:31:39,417 --> 00:31:41,497
We are thought of. 
Yeah.

580
00:31:41,697 --> 00:31:42,847
OK ? 
Yeah.

581
00:31:43,197 --> 00:31:45,247
Ben and I 
have been together since Yawa.

582
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:48,397
He was the only Hero 
and I was the only Fighter.

583
00:31:48,517 --> 00:31:51,047
But now 
we are really in the middle.

584
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:54,017
Think about it and let me know.

585
00:31:54,347 --> 00:31:54,927
OK.

586
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:55,977
The game starts from scratch.

587
00:31:56,097 --> 00:31:58,677
There are so many things to consider

588
00:31:58,797 --> 00:32:00,677
to make the best decision.

589
00:32:00,797 --> 00:32:02,017
It's very hard.

590
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:08,847
You're thinking Cole, not Joe?

591
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:10,247
It's... It's Cole.

592
00:32:10,697 --> 00:32:11,967
And Joe is our plan B.

593
00:32:12,647 --> 00:32:14,100
But at the council,

594
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,627
let's pretend we're going to 
vote Joe.

595
00:32:16,747 --> 00:32:18,547
Like that, he will play his idol.

596
00:32:19,497 --> 00:32:20,967
You don't think 
Cole has one?

597
00:32:21,467 --> 00:32:22,147
I do not know.

598
00:32:22,797 --> 00:32:26,297
The discussion 
revolves around who to eliminate: Joe or Cole.

599
00:32:26,447 --> 00:32:29,327
Where it's tricky is that we 
don't know if they have idols.

600
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,817
We need a plan B.

601
00:32:31,197 --> 00:32:34,077
If Joe plays an idol 
and Cole stands up

602
00:32:34,197 --> 00:32:35,647
with something crazy...

603
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,977
Plan B 
is next on the list.

604
00:32:38,097 --> 00:32:39,647
Who would it be? 
I ss.

605
00:32:39,767 --> 00:32:41,927
I think so too. 
It seems logical.

606
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:43,197
We have to do this.

607
00:32:43,497 --> 00:32:46,127
Eliminating Jessica would be fine with me.

608
00:32:46,247 --> 00:32:48,647
'Cause we think Joe 
might have an idol

609
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:50,517
or give one to Cole.

610
00:32:50,747 --> 00:32:53,577
it seems unlikely 
that Jessica has one.

611
00:32:53,697 --> 00:32:55,767
Also, Jessica and Cole 
have become very close

612
00:32:55,947 --> 00:32:57,477
and we want to separate them.

613
00:32:57,597 --> 00:33:00,147
I applied for this game 
for 16 years,

614
00:33:00,267 --> 00:33:02,877
so i know the game well enough 
to know

615
00:33:02,997 --> 00:33:05,967
that a council is alive, 
and that people change their minds.

616
00:33:06,497 --> 00:33:08,267
I hope to be 
on the right side of the votes tonight.

617
00:33:09,017 --> 00:33:11,947
You don't talk to me ' 
cause you're playing it cool, huh?

618
00:33:13,297 --> 00:33:14,447
It's true ? 
Yeah.

619
00:33:14,917 --> 00:33:18,600
Chrissy trusts me. 
Will I betray her tonight

620
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,347
and eliminate it, 
or break with the five Yawa

621
00:33:22,597 --> 00:33:24,317
and release a Healer?

622
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:28,127
I'm in the middle, 
and having to choose a side,

623
00:33:28,247 --> 00:33:33,517
that's the worst you can do 
in a million dollar game.

624
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:36,247
But one thing is certain, tonight

625
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:39,417
lines will be drawn, 
alliances will be forged.

626
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,197
War sucks.

627
00:33:41,317 --> 00:33:43,847
And it won't be pretty tonight 
either.

628
00:33:43,967 --> 00:33:45,517
Because tonight is war.

629
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,870
If this is your first tip,

630
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:00,890
take an unlit torch 
and light it in the fire.

631
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,500
It's part 
of the counseling ritual.

632
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,550
because in this game, 
fire represents your life.

633
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:11,370
If he disappears, so do you.

634
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:14,350
Well then. Fusion.

635
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,320
Significant, because we pass

636
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,770
to the individual part of the game.

637
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,400
Ryan, back 
to our original theme.

638
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,720
There are five Healers left,

639
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,900
four Heroes and three Fighters.

640
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,600
How important 
was it this afternoon,

641
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,690
considering 
the options for tonight?

642
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,850
Yes, there are these original divisions,

643
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:37,540
but also the divisions 
of the last eight days.

644
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,990
Dr. Mike, why 
don't you just say:

645
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,770
"Let's agree 
to bring out a Healer,

646
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:44,100
to rebalance the situation. 
They are five."?

647
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,220
This is the most obvious blow,

648
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,570
but most here are already thinking about 
the second and third shots.

649
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:54,140
I saw people scheming, 
really nervous people.

650
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:57,600
Jeff, we can procrastinate, 
play like, "Oh, I'm paranoid!"

651
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,650
In fact, I only heard 
three names.

652
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:03,820
So for all 12 to 
be nervous is bullshit.

653
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:07,570
Cole, there's an answer 
we're giving to the board.

654
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,840
"I'm worried." 
And then there is the truth.

655
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,820
"Actually, I have no worries 
tonight."

656
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,220
We're actually trying 
to tell our allies:

657
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,050
"I trust you." 
Absolutely.

658
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:21,250
I did my best 
to build strong alliances

659
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:24,290
and make sure those ties 
are strong. So I say:

660
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,270
"I trust you 
and am not worried."

661
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,850
Lauren, the definition 
of what makes you a target

662
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,400
changes from board to board.

663
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,000
Did you perceive that everyone 
assessed all types

664
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,840
threats to determine 
who to vote for?

665
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,940
You have to consider everything.

666
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,820
Is this person 
a physical threat?

667
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,900
Will she become 
a threat later?

668
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,970
Or does she just piss you 
off?

669
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,200
It's not just this evening at stake,

670
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,190
but also 
all those which will follow.

671
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,290
Chrissy, 
did you feel that too?

672
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:57,370
Yes. In general, in Survivor, 
right after the merge,

673
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:00,150
it's the physical threats. 
But in this season,

674
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:03,220
we consider 
many other factors.

675
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,400
Joe, you seemed to nod.

676
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,000
I've been honest 
since day one.

677
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,490
I am a strategist, 
sporty and intelligent.

678
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,400
But there is 
more dangerous than me.

679
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,320
Everyone talks about trust.

680
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,020
But is it real?

681
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,720
Because for me, yes. 
I have already come to the council.

682
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,220
I said to Desi, "I've got you covered."

683
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,950
And we're both here. 
So do you want someone

684
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:24,220
who throws names and says: 
"I vote with you

685
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,270
to this advice, but to the next one, 
ciao."?

686
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:29,990
And the people here, blah blah blah, 
that's all they do.

687
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:34,000
Dr. Mike, 
does that give you any comfort?

688
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,120
"If Joe is telling the truth, 
that's good for me.

689
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:39,990
Because I'm also a Healer, 
like Jessica and Cole."

690
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:43,250
Of course, if I weren't 
the most misplaced Healer.

691
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:45,100
Because Joe has been saying since day 1:

692
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,300
"I'm telling you, 
I've got you covered. Except Mike.

693
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,820
I say it: Mike, you're going to leave,

694
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,590
you are not 
in my circle of trust.

695
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,640
Hi !"

696
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:57,770
He said I was looking for the idol, 
but he found it.

697
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:00,270
But we settled 
our differences.

698
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,620
And I have affection 
and respect for Joe.

699
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,840
I'm sorry.

700
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,770
I said I found an idol? 
No, I found idols.

701
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,870
Every camp I go to, 
I find an idol there.

702
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,350
So let's change it.

703
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,040
Let's not talk about this vote.

704
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:15,140
Let's talk about the next one, 
because names will be mentioned.

705
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,920
Now 
everyone is worried.

706
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,420
Am I going to play it or not?

707
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,870
The other time, I almost played it

708
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,170
for someone you trust.

709
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,770
I let you admire it, 
see what you want to do.

710
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,570
And there I am relaxed.

711
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,890
It's ridiculous. 
Wow.

712
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:31,500
Cole, you reacted 
when Joe pulled this.

713
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,890
What did you think?

714
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,470
I know that in the names 
mentioned, there was Joe and me.

715
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,800
And Joe is protected if he wants it.

716
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,820
I don't have the same protection.

717
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,670
So that could be 
my first and last piece of advice.

718
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:44,890
We'll see.

719
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,000
Jessica, you can see 
how fast this game is changing.

720
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,890
A bomb has been dropped, 
and everyone must say to themselves:

721
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,050
"It could be me."

722
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,220
Absolutely. 
Idols change everything.

723
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:58,420
We wonder about his old 
allies and his new ones.

724
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,900
Joe was in my first tribe, 
and now I'm like,

725
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,170
"Are we still good? Or ciao?"

726
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:08,750
Jeff, Joe talks a lot, but 
he's been covering for me since day 1,

727
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,470
when we found the 1st idol.

728
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:13,940
So in times like this, 
I repeat to myself:

729
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,270
"I'm not worried, 
I trust you."

730
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,440
The lines are drawn, Jeff.

731
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:22,820
What does that mean ?

732
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:25,470
We are going to know 
who is allied to whom

733
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,770
and someone will leave.

734
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,790
You are right, because it is 
time to vote. Jessica, over to you.

735
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,100
I will count the votes.

736
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,970
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

737
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,090
now is the time to do it.

738
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,420
Might as well reset 
the counters to zero.

739
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,370
It's for me.

740
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,590
This is 
a hidden immunity idol.

741
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,890
Votes against Joe 
will not count.

742
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,020
I will read the votes.

743
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:15,340
Chrissy.

744
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,800
Jessica. Equality.

745
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,590
Two votes Chrissy, 
two votes Jessica.

746
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,320
Chrissy.

747
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,970
Jessica. 
Three votes Jessica.

748
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,520
New equality.

749
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,570
Four votes Chrissy, 
four votes Jessica.

750
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,170
That's five votes Chrissy.

751
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:44,570
New equality.

752
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,770
Five votes Chrissy, 
five votes Jessica.

753
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:57,420
6 votes Jessica, 5 votes Chrissy, 
one vote left.

754
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:05,200
Seventh person eliminated 
from Survivor:

755
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,800
Jessica.

756
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,390
Bring me your torch.

757
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,920
Jessica, the tribe has spoken. 
Thanks, Jeff.

758
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,020
It's time to go.

759
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,650
In Survivor, 
when boundaries are drawn,

760
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:35,400
what matters is not who leaves, 
but who survives,

761
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,850
and the new boundaries 
that are drawn.

762
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,440
Take your torches, 
return to camp. Good night.

763
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:55,290
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

764
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:59,500
Next time in Survivor...

765
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,210
The future of the Healers 
looks bleak.

766
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:03,480
Looks like the end of the world.

767
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,080
We were totally betrayed.

768
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:07,680
But they will not surrender 
without a fight.

769
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,780
Come ! I got it ! JP!

770
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,050
Cole started digging.

771
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,300
An idol.

772
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:17,030
Before my eyes, it was chaos.

773
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:20,930
I believe it was 
the worst betrayal of my life.

774
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,050
My heart is broken.

775
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,100
Who knew 
a game could crush you?

776
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,880
I thought 
only boys did that.

777
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,080
I was wrong. 
But I will miss Cole.

778
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,160
I hope he goes far, 
and maybe we go on a date

779
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,300
when Survivor is over.
