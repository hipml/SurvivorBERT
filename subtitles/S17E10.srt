194

You've probably seen me before,

yes, me, Crystal, the 2004

196
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,294

It's time for me to tackle some

198
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,005
new challenges in my life.

199
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:39,589
Why I think I should be it?

200
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,133
Because I have the three "B"s:

201
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,634
brains, beauty, and blazing

202
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,635

Grew up pretty poor.

Still am pretty poor.

206
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:49,974

Anyway, please call me.

209
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,686
Um, I do want to bring my

210
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,688
tweezers because I don't want

211
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,981
to have a hairy mustache and

212
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,149
a beard when I come home.

213
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,358
That would not be cool.

214
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,359
Okay, got to go.

So, please call me, Mr. Burnett.

losers are my mind games.

227
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,376
I can out-predict everyone so

228
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,587

231
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,007
And I'm a graduate of the

232
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,342
University of Florida where I

233
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,551
went on full academic

234
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,512

00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,347
years, and with highest honors.

236
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,806
I've got two tactics.

237
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,933
One: flirtation.

238
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,351
The second tactic is

239
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,727
manipulation.

240
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,522
Oh, and one more thing... I'm a

241
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,523
risk taker.

242
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,066
I always jump into the deep end

00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:43,069

I'm jobless and homeless right

246
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:48,866
now.

247
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,409
Um, my dad passed away five and

248
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,994
a half months ago, and I need to

249
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,788

250
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,206
right now.

251
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,791
So, it would be, like, the best

252
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,084
thing that-that I could do for

00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,085
myself.

00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,176
>> I have Jacquie, Marcus,

383
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,969
Charlie, you know.

384
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:37,970
We're all in your boat.

385
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,180
As long as, you know, you feel

386
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,598
the same way we do, we're all in

387
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:41,640
it together.

388
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,224
Here's the deal: these are the

389
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,642
four; you're the fifth.

390
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,602
That's all you need to know.

391
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:45,603
It's the majority; that's it.

392
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,771
So lock it down.

393
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,772
That's it.

394
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,774
>> That's a good point.

395
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,067
>> PROBST: And when Kota won yet

396
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,276
another challenge...

397
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,694
Kota wins immunity and reward!

398
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,364
...they sent Dan from Fang to

399
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,740
be the first to visit Exile

400
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:58,783
Island.

401
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,035
But this time, Exile Island was

402
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,036
different.

403
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,329
Dan had a choice between getting

404
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,830
a clue to the hidden immunity

405
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,832
idol or spending the time there

406
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,668
in idle comfort.

407
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,669
Dan chose the clue, but his

408
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,046
search for the idol came up

409
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,047
empty.

410
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,048
>> I'm tired.

411
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,467
I'm thirsty, hungry, and I

412
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,428
cannot find this immunity idol.

413
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,471
>> PROBST: At Kota, there was

414
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:23,557
love in the air.

415
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,607
>> So Marcus and Jacquie always

416
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,443
go off together and have become

417
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,279
the couple of our tribe, which

418
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,031
is a problem.

419
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:39,782
Because any time you are in a

420
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,575
romantic involvement with

421
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,201
somebody else, it puts a target

422
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,577
on your back.

423
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,203
Honestly, every time you go off

424
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,454
with Jacquie, everyone makes

425
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,288
comments.

426
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,039
>> Do they?

427
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:47,832
Dude, is that why...?

428
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:48,457
>> Yes. Yesterday, you guys were

429
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,834
standing at the end of the dock.

430
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:50,835
They were like, "Do you think

431
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:51,836
they would agree to just get

432
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,003
married at the end of the dock

433
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:53,796
right there?"

434
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,797
Yeah, you got some problems.

435
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,881
You need to watch yourself.

436
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,174
I have no intention of staying

437
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,217
with them if they continue

438
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,135
this behavior.

439
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,136
It's just not...

440
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,220
It's bad business.

441
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,222
(hoots)

442
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:03,889

443
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,850
a reward challenge...

444
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:06,851
Fang wins reward!

445
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,727
(cheering)

446
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:09,311
...they sent Sugar to Exile

447
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:09,979
Island.

448
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:10,980
>> I knew that.

449
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,773
>> PROBST: How did you know

450
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:12,982
that?

451
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,942
>> I knew that they were going

452
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,235
to pick me because they think

453
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,361
I'm dumb.

454
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,279
>> PROBST: Some of Sugar's

455
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,197
tribe mates had little faith

456
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,198
she would survive on Exile.

457
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,741
>> She's not going to be able

458
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:23,033
to find it.

459
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,785
She just... She's a pinup.

460
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:25,953
Her name's Sugar.

461
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,872
I think Sugar on Exile Island is

462
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,165
doing about as bad as anybody

463
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,207
can be doing on Exile.

464
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,542
She is so, like, clutching her

465
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,585
knees, rocking back and forth,

466
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:33,586
hysterically crying.

467
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,421
She has an attempted hope for

468
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,506
the idol.

469
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,174
She's probably this close from a

470
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,800
complete meltdown.

471
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,427
If not already in the throes of

472
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,972
a meltdown.

473
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,056

474
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,516
underestimated the will of the

475

pinup model.

476
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,101
>> (gasps) Oh, my God, I found

477
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:49,852
it!

478
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,896
>> PROBST: And just like that,

479
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:52,897
Sugar had become the most

480
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,107
powerful player in the game.

481
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,610
>> When Fang sent me to Exile,

482
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:58,194
I thought maybe they thought I

483
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,446
was dumb and that I'd never find

484
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,323
the idol, no way.

485
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,032
I can't believe I found it and

486
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,825
the lawyer didn't.

487
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,577
How funny is that?

488
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,329
That's funny.

no picnic for Corinne.

492
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,210

poison to these people.

494
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,922

from Exile, she let Ace, her

498

closest ally, in on her secret.

499

told that Sugar has the immunity

00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,319
done is deal with it.

571
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,862
I'm not the nicest guy in the

572
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:47,863
world.

573
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:49,948
I've had a tough 49 years, but,

574
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,200
uh, Matty knows, if you get me,

575
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,911
you're not offended by me.

576
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,454
If you don't get me, you go

577
00:15:55,537 --> 00:16:00,000
crying home to Mama.

578
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,961
(yawning)

579
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,088
>> PROBST: Fang finally started

580
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,714
thinking about alliances when

581
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,384
Matty, Randy, Susie, and Dan

582
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,468
vowed to stick together.

583
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:10,844
>> We are all totally on the

584
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:11,845
same page with this?

585
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,180
We don't need to talk about this

586
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:13,389
anymore.

587
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,056
>> No.

588
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,891
>> Just put it in.

589
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:16,725
>> We don't.

590
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,727
>> All that matters is the four

591
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,522
of us.

592
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:22,856
>> PROBST: But at the reward

593
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,316
challenge, all bets were off

594
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,734
when an unexpected announcement

595
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,944
was made.

596
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:27,986
We are picking new tribes.

597
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,987
>> What?!

598
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:29,988
>> No!

599
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:30,447
>> No. No, no, no, no!

600
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,031
>> Oh, wow!

601
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,032
>> PROBST: Drop your buffs.

602
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,033
>> No!

603
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,034
>> Oh!

604
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,953
>> Oh!

605
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,830
>> Damn it!

606
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,164
>> I had it all perfect.

607
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,291
Dan, Randy, and Susie and I

608
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,127
solidified our foursome, and I

609
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,837
was super content with it.

610
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,129
I was happy.

611
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,255
I was comfortable with that

612
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,090
foursome.

613
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,967
And then Jeff's, like, "We're

614
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,093
going to switch teams."

615
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,011
And I was just, like, "Oh, no!"

616
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,763
That was just such a buzz-kill.

617
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,306
I didn't even want to hear that.

618
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,766
>> PROBST: Given the opportunity

619
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,143
for Fang to build a stronger

620
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,728
tribe in another schoolyard

621
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,479
pick, they blew it again with

622
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,731
some odd choices.

623
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:04,773
>> I'm gonna go with Kelly.

624
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,066
I want to get to know her.

625
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,359
>> PROBST: That may be the most

626
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,736
surprising decision in ten days

627
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,612
out here.

628
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,947
>> Of course, the mat gets fully

629
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:12,531
pulled out from under me, you

630
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,115
know?

631
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,159
It's like the Bad News Bears

632
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:15,367
again.

633
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,077
We're the goof troop.

634
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,454
>> PROBST: The new red tribe was

635
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,831
Matty, Kenny, Crystal, Kelly,

636
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,791
Jacquie, and Ace.

637
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,333
And the new yellow tribe was

638
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:27,880
Corinne, Bob, Susie, Randy, Dan,

639
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,716
Marcus and Charlie, leaving

640
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,967
Sugar left standing.

641
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:32,468
>> What does that mean?

642
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,344
>> PROBST: You will go to Exile

643
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,345
Island.

644
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,346
>> (groaning): Oh, no!

645
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,347
(laughter)

646
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,640
>> PROBST: You will then join

647
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,224
the tribe that goes to Tribal

648
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,853
Council and loses a member.

649
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,104
Since Sugar already had the

650
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,981
hidden immunity idol, this time

651
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:47,399
she decided to settle into the

652
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,442
shack.

653
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,444
>> Comfort time!

654
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,070
Oh, my God, this is so good.

655
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,156
(laughs)

656
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,123
>> PROBST: At the new Kota

657
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,917
tribe, Randy was trying hard to

658
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,542
keep his aggressive personality

659
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,753
at bay in an effort to secure a

660
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:08,796
long-lasting position in his new

661
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:09,797
tribe.

662
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,089
>> I bet you that you're gonna

663
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,132
have to be farther away, though.

664
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,175
>> Susie's doing a great job

665
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,760
around camp, and if Randy has a

666
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,053
poor performance on a challenge,

667
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,221
and he's not really doing that

668
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,263
much around camp, shoot, I'd

669
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,349
rather keep Susie around.

670
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,270
(laughter)

671
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,481
>> Randy.

672
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,732
>> PROBST: And at the immunity

673
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,943
challenge, Randy proved he was

674
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,319
a force to be reckoned with...

675
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,154
(grunts)

676
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,155
>> Yeah!

677
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,323
>> PROBST: ...and helped his new

678
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,324
tribe continue their winning

679
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,325
streak.

680
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,827
Kota wins immunity!

681
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,203
>> Yes! Yes! Yeah!

682
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,871
Yeah!

683
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,165
Go, Kota!

684
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,209
>> PROBST: Back at Fang,

685
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,545
Crystal, Kenny, and Matty had to

686
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,546
decide which newly-inherited

687
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,089
member of Kota would go next and

688
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,048
why.

689
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:53,841
>> I say Kelly.

690
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:54,925
I think Kelly's the weakest

691
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:55,634
link.

692
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:56,218
We were going to vote off Sue

693
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,970
next.

694
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:58,595
What's the difference in Sue and

695
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,013
Kelly?

696
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:00,806
Not a damn thing.

697
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:01,431
>> The difference is, uh, Sugar

698
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,266
may have the immunity idol.

699
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:05,352
Ace, Sugar, and Jacquie: those

700
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:08,772
three right now is real deadly.

701
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,274
>> Darn it.

702
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,483
>> You cool?

703
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,278
>> Yeah.

704
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,738
>> PROBST: That night at Tribal

705
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,448
Council, Crystal's influence

706
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,408
over the tribe prevailed, and

707
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,785
an original frontrunner of Kota

708
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,453
was voted out.

709
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:27,583
Jacquie, the tribe has spoken.

710
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,255
When Sugar returned to her new

711
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,674
home, the Fang tribe, she was

712
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:36,675
disappointed that Jacquie wasn't

713
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:37,718
there.

714
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:38,886
>> Welcome back.

715
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,095
>> Yeah.

716
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:40,721
So, that means Jacquie's gone.

717
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:41,305
>> Yup.

718
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,306
>> Yup.

719
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:45,392
>> That sucks.

720
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,230
(roaring)

721
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,690
>> PROBST: The next day, Corinne

722
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:52,274
was just as shocked to learn

723
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,276
that one of her closest allies

724
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,277
had been voted out.

725
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:55,444
>> Oh!

726
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,487
>> PROBST: A lot of reactions on

727
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,280
Kota.

728
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:58,530
Surprised?

729
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,198
>> Yeah.

730
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,242
>> Definitely.

731
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,452
>> PROBST: From the very first

732
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,662
days of his adventure, Bob's

733
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,289
fatherly ways and ingenious

734
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,291
craftsmanship were his way to

735
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,751
keep him in the game.

736
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:11,793
>> It's actually turning out to

737
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,128
be a nice-looking bench.

738
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:14,838
>> This is the coolest stuff.

739
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:15,589
>><i> You're</i> the coolest, Bob.

740
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,091
>> This is a slingshot we're

741
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,426
supposed to kill birds with, but

742
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,469
it also acts as a, uh, Hawaiian

743
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,346
sling.

744
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,680
>> And how many birds have you

745
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:24,681
gotten?

746
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:25,682
>> Uh, none.

747
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:26,266
We're in the middle of the

748
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,393
jungle, and this is my forte,

749
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,478
and they all know it.

750
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,021
I made that tripod to put the

751
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,357
pot on so we could cook with it,

752
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,983
and I made the spoon, made the

753
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,401
spear thing.

754
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,444
>> Marcus, don't you think we...

755
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,071
that would have been nice for a

756
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,030
fish?

757
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,531
>> Yeah, but it's bottom-heavy.

758
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,617
>> I am valuable to them, and

00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:36,686
idol now needed it and was

1135
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:37,061
voted out.

1136
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,397
Ninth person voted out of

1137
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,106
<i>Survivor: Gabon,</i> and the first

1138
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:43,026
member of our jury....

1139
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:46,112
Marcus.

1140
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,118
At the next reward challenge,

1141
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,411
Fang was in shock that Marcus

1142
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:54,412
was gone.

1143
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:55,455
>> He didn't deserve to leave

1144
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,456
the game.

1145
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,415
>> PROBST: And Kenny's

1146
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,833
confidence was growing.

1147
00:31:58,916 --> 00:31:59,834
>> Then who does?

1148
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:00,418
Who does deserve to leave the

1149
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:00,960
game?

1150
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,421
>> I could not believe they had

1151
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,422
gotten rid of Marcus.

1152
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,174
It was so heartbreaking, just

1153
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,634
because that really damages my

1154
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,344
chances at the game.

1155
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,386
>> PROBST: But Fang won the

1156
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,387
challenge.

1157
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,139
>> Hey, we won!

1158
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,224
>> PROBST: And Bob was sent to

1159
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,809
Exile Island.

1160
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:17,810
Bob, grab your stuff.

1161
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,229
(shouting)

1162
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,773
Matty and his tribe enjoyed

1163
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,274
some real African culture and

1164
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,901
food at a local village in

1165
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,153
Gabon.

1166
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,071
>> I know.

1167
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,156
>> PROBST: While over on Exile,

1168
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,991
Bob searched for the idol, not

1169
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,493
knowing that Sugar already had

1170
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:34,494
it.

1171
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,828
>> The fourth clue got me

1172
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:36,287
completely perplexed.

1173
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,539
>> PROBST: Bob decided he

1174
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,082
couldn't leave Exile Island

1175
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,041
empty-handed, so he made his

1176
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:43,127
first major strategic move.

1177
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,253
>> I'm going to make something

1178
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,838
that looks like an idol so that

1179
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:46,381
they think I have an idol.

1180
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,173
Sort of like when you're

1181
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,550
holding up a bank.

1182
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,677
You don't necessarily need the

1183
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,053
gun, but if they think you've

1184
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,096
got a gun, they might leave you

1185
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,181
alone.

1186
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:58,267
This is my new fake idol.

1187
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,730
>> PROBST: Coming up, Randy

1188
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,314
stirs up trouble around camp.

1189
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,065
>> Desperate times, man, call

1190
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,066
for desperate measures.

1191
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,527
>> Shut up, Randy.

1192
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,613
You're being a lunatic.

1193
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,160
>> PROBST: At the next immunity

1194
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,413
challenge, the merge was finally

1195
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,789
announced.

1196
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,665
Your merge.

1197
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:21,666
>> Oh, wow!

1198
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:22,667
>> Yes!

1199
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,835
>> PROBST: And Susie surprised

1200
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,795
everyone by winning immunity.

1201
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:26,879
>> Yes!

1202
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,589
>> PROBST: Susie wins immunity!

1203
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,174
Back at the newly merged camp...

1204
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,509
>> People bounced into the

1205
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:32,552
jungle and started their

1206
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:33,553
strategies.

1207
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:34,554
>> PROBST: ...Charlie and Randy

1208
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:35,555
were gunning for Crystal.

1209
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,473
>> Crystal's the way to go.

1210
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,600
Bob will vote Crystal.

1211
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,353
>> PROBST: With Sugar in the

1212
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,354
middle, Corinne and Charlie

1213
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,856
tried to convince her to vote

1214
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:45,898
with the old Kota.

1215
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,984
>> Yeah. I'm...

1216
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,111
>> We can do Randy next.

1217
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,237
>> PROBST: What Charlie didn't

1218
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,031
know was that Matty, Susie,

1219
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,491
Crystal, and Kenny had a

1220
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,826
different victim in mind.

1221
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:57,827
>> This is some real.

1222
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,705
This is the realness over here.

1223
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:01,706
>> Write down Charlie.

1224
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:02,665
Write down Charlie.

1225
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,000
>> Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

1226
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,209
>> PROBST: And Kenny tried to

1227
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,586
pull Sugar over to his side.

1228
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:07,628
>> Charlie is the brains behind

1229
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,172
all of it.

1230
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,298
>> Yes.

1231
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,340
>> PROBST: Knowing the vote was

1232
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,050
in her hands, Sugar had to

1233
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,427
decide whether to go with her

1234
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,138
old tribe or her new allies, who

1235
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,891
promised to take her to the end.

1236
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:20,933
And that night at Tribal

1237
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,268
Council, Sugar's vote sealed the

1238
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,395
deal, and the early underdogs

1239
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,271
suddenly became the clear

1240
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:28,065
frontrunners in the game.

1241
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,484
Tenth person voted out of

1242
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,569
<i>Survivor: Gabon...</i>

1243
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:34,822
Charlie.

1244
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,992
With Charlie gone, Bob, Randy,

1245
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,577
and Corinne found themselves in

1246
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,244
the minority of a tribe led by

1247
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,245
Sugar.

1248
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,414
>> Even though I don't like the

1249
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,957
way you've been talking--

1250
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,042
negative and everything--

1251
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:46,667
I thought maybe you could learn

1252
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,211
from me by telling you

1253
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,212
and-and...

1254
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,296
>> Let your countenance be your

1255
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:51,130
light.

1256
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:51,589
>> Yeah, a little bit.

1257
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:52,256
I know that sounds stupid,

1258
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,050
though.

1259
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,092
>> But that's how some people

1260
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,094
need to learn.

1261
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,470
>> Right, so I'm just letting

1262
00:34:57,553 --> 00:35:00,681
you know that I hate the way

1263
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,266
you've been, but-but I know that

1264
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,309
you're not a bad person.

1265
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,019
You just got a little out of

1266
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,020
hand.

1267
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:06,604
>> So this morning, I'm in the

1268
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,023
hut, and Sugar decides that

1269
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:10,858
she's going to teach me a

1270
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,903
lesson about life.

1271
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:14,529
>> We had one good conversation.

1272
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,073
The rest the time, it was you

1273
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,366
and Randy talking about

1274
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,367
everybody else.

1275
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,368
And it's just...

1276
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,369
It's a negative way of being,

1277
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,704
and it was happening so much,

1278
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,414
I was just like, "Oh, my God.

1279
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,791
It's like cancer in my ears."

1280
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,084
It's, like, all the complaints.

1281
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,085
Nothing was good enough.

1282
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,962
It was horrible.

1283
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:31,504
Okay, I don't want to keep

1284
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,172
harping on it.

1285
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,799
I just want you to realize that

1286
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:37,093
everything that you say is-is

1287
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,094
noted, you know, and-and...

1288
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,220
>> All right.

1289
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,221
>> You know?

1290
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,056
Okay, cool.

1291
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:42,932
I'm sorry.

1292
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,267
I just wanted to...

1293
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,643
to talk to you about it.

1294
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,478
>> From a girl who is-- I'm

1295
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,939
sorry-- a non-college-graduate

1296
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:52,108
waitress who's out of work.

1297
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,734
She doesn't even have a waitress

1298
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:54,819
job.

1299
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:55,444
She lives off the "kindness" of

1300
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,320
others.

1301
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,364
I don't like people that live

1302
00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,657
off the kindness of others.

1303
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,617
There is no honor in that.

1304
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:02,243
Just more like a second to vent.

1305
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,244
I want to kill Sugar.

1306
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,037
I hate her.

1307
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:05,830
>> She's horrible.

1308
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:06,622
>> You don't understand.

1309
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,040
She pulls me into the tent, and

1310
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:08,583
she's like, "I know that you

1311
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,334
were making fun of me, and I

1312
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,586
know what you and Randy said,

1313
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,920
and you don't even know me, and

1314
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:13,838
I want to teach you about

1315
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:14,839
forgiveness and about how being

1316
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:15,882
nice to people is better than

1317
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:16,674
being mean."

1318
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:17,967
So I was, like, "You know, I

1319
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:18,759
don't have any friends.

1320
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,177
You're the only person I have

1321
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:20,970
left."

1322
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:21,804
I'm sitting there, like,

1323
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,597
cringing.

1324
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,389
Like, "Really, bitch, you're

1325
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:24,390
going to teach me something?

1326
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,391
I'm gonna teach you something."

1327
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,517
>> She's the worst person in the

1328
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,310
world.

1329
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,477
It's people like that that are

1330
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,270
so self-righteous...

1331
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:29,645
>> Oh! Oh, my God!

1332
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:30,396
>> ...and high-and-mighty that

1333
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,356
are a million times more evil

1334
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:32,607
than me.

1335
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,399
>> My favorite... My favorite

1336
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,526
is, like, she's so stupid...

1337
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,527
>> That it's dangerous.

1338
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,737
>> Yes! And I'm just, like...

1339
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,738
I never complained.

1340
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:39,780
She's the one who keep...

1341
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:40,781
She's always complaining about

1342
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:41,782
where she sleeps.

1343
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:42,783
She's complaining about where

1344
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:43,659
she's sitting.

1345
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:44,702
I won't... I can't even...

1346
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:45,536
I just...

1347
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,370
You don't understand.

1348
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,164
All that gets me through the day

1349
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,081
is, I've rehearsed the speech

1350
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:49,665
I'm gonna give after they say

1351
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:50,917
my name at Tribal.

1352
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,500
I'm gonna turn on her and be,

1353
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,251
like, "You know what the best

1354
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,377
part about going home is?

1355
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,421
I don't have to pretend to like

1356
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:55,755
you anymore."

1357
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:56,255
>> Exactly.

1358
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,299
>> I'm gonna be<i> nasty</i> at Tribal.

1359
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,300
>> Yeah, I know.

1360
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,468
>> Oh, there.

1361
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,470
Go, go, go, go.

1362
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,096
At the very least, I have the

1363
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:04,388
jury.

1364
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,724
We'll give the million to who

1365
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,267
we want to give the million to,

1366
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,560
and trust that won't be Sugar.

1367
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,103
I don't know who it will be,

1368
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,146
but it won't be Sugar.

1369
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:12,688
So, her little teaching me a

1370
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:13,481
lesson?

1371
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,274
Really?

1372
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,692
This is how the lesson goes,

1373
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,861
bitch.

1374
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:19,487
>> PROBST: Now with no alliance

1375
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,615
left, Bob showed Sugar his only

1376
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:23,616
asset.

1377
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:24,951
>> I couldn't find it anywhere.

1378
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,035
I made a fake one.

1379
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:26,994
>> Oh, my God.

1380
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,454
That's awesome.

1381
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:29,997
>> PROBST: At the next reward

1382
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,457
challenge, a<i> Survivor</i> auction

1383
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,209
was full of surprises.

1384
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:33,834
If you see something you like,

1385
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,294
you should bid on it.

1386
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,004
>> "Send yourself or someone

1387
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,214
else to Exile Island."

1388
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,257
>> Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1389
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,257
>> I'll take Bob.

1390
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:40,633
I'm sorry, Bob.

1391
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,134
>> PROBST: Bob, get your

1392
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:42,969
personal items.

1393
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,011
You're going back to Exile

1394
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:44,845
Island.

1395
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:45,471
You will return in time for the

1396
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:46,347
next immunity challenge.

1397
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,390
And Randy thought he'd soften

1398
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,517
his image with a plate of

1399
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,518
cookies.

1400
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,435
>> $20.

1401
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,436
>> PROBST: Sold to Randy.

1402
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,437
>> Oh, my God, Randy.

1403
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,438
>> Would you like one?

1404
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,399
>> I couldn't possibly.

1405
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,025
>> PROBST: But Sugar couldn't

1406
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,068
hide her dislike for Randy.

1407
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,111
Randy, you're giving Sugar's to

1408
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,112
Corinne?

1409
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,113
>> Sugar doesn't have one.

1410
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:02,655
I offered her one, and she

1411
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,323
didn't take one.

1412
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,366
>> PROBST: But he couldn't charm

1413
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,325
Sugar.

1414
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:06,701
>> Last chance.

1415
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,411
You can have a full one.

1416
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,662
>> PROBST: And he lost his last

1417
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:10,955
cookie when Sugar snatched it up

1418
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:11,956
and gave it to Matty.

1419
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,958
>> That cookie's tainted.

1420
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,001
>> PROBST: Back at camp, Randy

1421
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,043
just couldn't let it go.

1422
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:16,669
>> That wasn't a gift from her,

1423
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,129
man.

1424
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,005
That was my cookie.

1425
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,548
I didn't get one.

1426
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:21,549
You had two.

1427
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,550
I had none.

1428
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:23,426
>> Sorry.

1429
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:26,262
>> I left the auction half

1430
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,555
drunk and pissed off.

1431
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,015
>> PROBST: Unaware that Sugar

1432
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:29,849
had the hidden immunity idol,

1433
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:31,559
Randy bet on Bob finding the

1434
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,436
idol at Exile and giving it to

1435
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,063
him, so he cooked up a

1436
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,440
last-ditch scheme with Corinne.

1437
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,567
>> FYI, I'm going to be crashing

1438
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,818
and burning all day, making

1439
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,194
everybody miserable.

1440
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:45,031
Our only prayer is if Bob would

1441
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,782
give me the idol.

1442
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:47,825
>> I love it.

1443
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:48,826
>> It's our only prayer.

1444
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:49,535
>> That's a great plan.

1445
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,912
>> PROBST: Randy purposefully

1446
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,414
made himself irritating to get

1447
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,916
people to vote for him.

1448
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:04,300
(Randy imitates yawning)

1449
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:05,426
>> Oh, my God, don't do this,

1450
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,427
dude.

1451
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,220
Don't.

1452
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,388
>> What are you going to do,

1453
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,473
vote me out?

1454
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,141
Desperate times, man, call for

1455
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,142
desperate measures.

1456
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:13,559
>> Shut up, Randy!

1457
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:14,560
You're being a lunatic.

1458
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:15,561
>> Well...

1459
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,646
>> Be nice, bro.

1460
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,482
>> I got to do what I got to do.

1461
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,900
There's not a normal person

1462
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:22,818
among these idiots, except you,

1463
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:23,903
and you even whored yourself

1464
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:24,904
out.

1465
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:25,905
You know you have.

1466
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,198
You know, I don't blame you.

1467
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:27,823
It's worth a million dollars to

1468
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:28,532
you.

1469
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:31,452
It's not to me.

1470
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,453
>> Oh, my God.

1471
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:37,124
(Randy laughing)

1472
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,834
>> It's a no-brainer that Randy

1473
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:39,460
has to go home now, so

1474
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,171
everybody's a little paranoid

1475
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:42,755
today about him burning the

1476
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,590
camp down, dumping our food,

1477
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:47,301
ravaging people's personal

1478
00:39:47,384 --> 00:39:49,386
items.

1479
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,723
>> I'm just scared he's going to

1480
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,308
dump out the coffee, throw the

1481
00:39:54,391 --> 00:39:55,476
beans and rice into the woods,

1482
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,978
or whatever.

1483
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,063
>> Yeah. He's just not happy

1484
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,064
right now.

1485
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,065
>> But he dug his own grave.

1486
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,066
There's a reason he's leaving.

1487
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,359
>> You just got to keep an eye

1488
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:04,360
out.

1489
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:04,985
>> I don't know why he's still

1490
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:05,486
here.

1491
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,487
>> I can't even believe he's

1492
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,322
still here.

1493
00:40:08,405 --> 00:40:08,906
>> Well, first we have to beat

1494
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:09,573
him at this challenge.

1495
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:10,491
>> I think he's crazy.

1496
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:11,492
I think he might be crazy.

1497
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,493
>> This is ridiculous.

1498
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,494
>> Uh-uh.

1499
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,788
>> Randy got to go.

1500
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:18,415
Randy needs to go.

1501
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,416
He is a troll.

1502
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,668
He is wreaking havoc in the

00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:31,095
Kenny wins immunity!

1508
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:33,514
With Randy on his last legs,

1509
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:36,600

made his last move.

1521
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:07,548
But the joke was on him.

1522
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,592
This is not a hidden immunity

1523
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,635
idol.

thing: trust.
