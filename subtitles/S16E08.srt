2
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:04,170
<i>Survivor...</i>

3
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:04,421
>> Yes!

4
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:05,797
>> PROBST: ...despite winning

5
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,548
challenges...

6
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:07,590
Airai wins!

7
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:08,842
...the Airai tribe was losing

8
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,427
players.

9
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,636
First, Jonathan.

10
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,470
>> I can't be here one more

11
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:13,221
minute.

12
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:14,472
>> PROBST: Then Kathy.

13
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:15,265
On Exile Island, Ozzy found the

14
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:18,560
hidden immunity idol and

15
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,061
replaced it with a fake one as a

16
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,188
decoy, which was discovered by

17
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,356
Jason.

18
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,233
>> There we go, baby.

19
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:26,735
I guess this is the hidden

20
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:27,068
immunity idol.

21
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,112
>> PROBST: At Malakal, Ozzy

22
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,072
practically adopted Erik.

23
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,907
>> They're like<i> The Lion King--</i>

24
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,033
the father, when he was teaching

25
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,285
the cub.

26
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,411
>> PROBST: So when his tribe was

27
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:38,037
facing tribal council, he knew

28
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:38,621
exactly who he wanted to vote

29
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:39,914
out.

30
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:40,790
>> I don't think that there's

31
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,084
any argument for keeping Tracy.

32
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,127
>> PROBST: But Ami saw a chance

33
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,670
to turn against the favorites

34
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,172
and go after Ozzy.

35
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:47,797
>> Sometimes you have to pull

36
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,090
the dirty cards to stay in the

37
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,717
game.

38
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,885
>> PROBST: Tracy also went after

39
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,595
Ozzy, warning everyone that he's

40
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:54,262
not only the tribe leader but

41
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:56,556
the biggest threat.

42
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,016
>> I think I'd be a better tribe

43
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,017
member than somebody that's

44
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,226
going to demolish you if you do

45
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,561
go to the merge.

46
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:02,562
>> PROBST: But in the end, Ami

47
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:03,229
sided with the favorites.

48
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,105
Seventh person voted out of

49
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,148
<i>Survivor: Fans vs. Favorites,</i>

50
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,358
Tracy.

51
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,234
And Tracy was sent home, leaving

52
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,529
Erik as the only remaining fan

53
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,532
on the Malakal tribe.

54
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,034
11 are left.

55
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:40,141
Who will be voted out tonight?

56
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,392
>> Tonight at tribal, Tracy went

57
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,977
home.

58
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,354
I feel lucky to be here still.

59
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,688
I feel really, really lucky to

60
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,940
still be here and have a shot at

61
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,691
this game.

62
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,069
But I am scared to death,

63
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,655
because I'm the last fan left,

64
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:54,239
and I don't think I see any

65
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,282
leeway with these favorites.

66
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,576
I feel like I'm the next to go,

67
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,745
no matter what happens now in

68
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:01,162
the future.

69
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:19,722
>> Here, scratch my back.

70
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:20,849
>> Tribal council was a little

71
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:21,307
bit of an eye opener.

72
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,226
Tracy described me as the

73
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,477
leader.

74
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,270
I really don't think that I'm

75
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,438
the leader.

76
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,566
I just think that I've got a lot

77
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,316
of good opinions and a lot of

78
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,152
know-how when it comes to

79
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:33,736
surviving out here, and people

80
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,322
respect that.

81
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,365
Even though I think I'm a

82
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,783
valuable asset, I'm going to

83
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:39,409
have a giant target on my back.

84
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,120
And that's the kind of situation

85
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,747
that I want to avoid.

>> Come on!

93
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,269
No, no, no!

94
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,939
Go in there!

95
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,861
Nice work.

96
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,279
All right.

97
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,322
This will give a girl a heart

98
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,992
attack.

99
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,752
That was fun this morning.

100
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:55,461
>> Uh-huh.

101
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,462
>> Ozzy's like, "Did you guys

102
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,798
get anything?"

103
00:04:58,881 --> 00:04:59,382
"No, not really, just eight

104
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:03,136
crabs."

105
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:03,636
>> You guys did awesome!

106
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,763
>> We're the crab warriors.

107
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:06,347
>> That's crazy!

108
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:10,018
Girl, give me some sugar.

109
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,524
>> Well, don't let it get to you

110
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,650
yet.

111
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:24,824
>> Well, who cares about that

112
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:25,450
stuff?

113
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,869
Don't worry about that.

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,752
>> Like, last night, Tracy was

115
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,587
trying everything in her power

116
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,922
to get you to get voted off.

117
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:40,673
She was coming to me.

118
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:41,174
She was coming to Cirie.

119
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,675
She's, like, trying everything.

120
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,593
Who cares?

121
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,761
I stopped anything crazy from

122
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,013
happening.

123
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,560
Yeah.

124
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,438
>> Tracy is sneaky.

125
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,439
>> It's not that big of a deal,

126
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:56,689
you know.

127
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,274
It didn't happen, and it's not

128
00:05:58,357 --> 00:05:59,317
going to happen, so don't worry

129
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,943
about it.

130
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,820
Okay?

131
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:03,446
>> This morning, Ami ended up

132
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,531
telling me that she was

133
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,366
approached by Tracy and asked to

134
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,244
vote for me, but she said, you

135
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:10,828
know, that she wasn't going to

136
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,789
do that and she's on my side.

137
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,165
>> You're not in any danger.

138
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,041
Like, let it go.

139
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,084
>> It's just the tribal council

140
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,126
last night was kind of like...

141
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,461
>> I'm not leaving you.

142
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,504
>> But Ami's a little too

143
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,214
adamant about that.

144
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,381
And as much as she says she's on

145
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,633
my side, I'm starting to get

146
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,177
uneasy feelings.

147
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,357
>> I was dreaming about pizza

148
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,943
that I just put in an oven.

149
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:42,485
>> Fluffy on top.

150
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,486
>> Yeah.

151
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,988
Mm!

152
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:46,739
I just don't want another

153
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:47,824
bite of coconut.

154
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,326
I just don't.

155
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,562
>> Oh, my God.

156
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:21,691
>> Ah, you got him!

157
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:22,608
Oh, my God!

158
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,402
>> Oh, my God!

159
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,319
>> Oh, my God.

160
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,154
>> Oh, my God!

161
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:26,612
Oh, my God!

162
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,280
Oh, my God!

163
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,323
Oh, my God!

164
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,074
James!

165
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,200
>> What?

166
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,327
>> He caught a rat!

167
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,246
>> I cannot believe you just

168
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,247
caught a rat.

169
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,707
>> Oh, poor guy.

170
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,876
Get the shish kebab and just,

171
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,543
like...

172
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,919
>> Oh.

173
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,087
>> There's nothing on him,

174
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,213
though, really.

175
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:44,964
I think I'm going to feel a

176
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,424
little bad eating the rat.

177
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,008
You know, he's a small guy.

178
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,843
There's not much meat on there.

179
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,386
But you know, out here, we're in

180
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:51,512
the bush, and it's survival of

181
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,555
the fittest.

182
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,764
So yeah, I'm going to dig into

183
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:54,515
the rat and give it a shot.

184
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,809
We'll stick a skewer through

185
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,060
him, barbecue him up.

186
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,353
Nobody has eaten a rat since the

187
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,855
first season of<i> Survivor,</i> so

188
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,106
it's kind of cool.

189
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:02,899
I'll be able to bring that

190
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,025
tradition back.

191
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,359
>> Ew, look at his tail.

192
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,736
He's so yuck.

193
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,363
>> I sure the tail is delicious.

194
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,072
>> Have you ever had a rat

195
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:10,698
before?

196
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:10,948
>> Never.

197
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:11,699
>> I think Jason's been trying

198
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:12,700
to impress the favorites ever

199
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,535
since the switch up.

200
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,661
It's not working, though.

201
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,872
I think he's a loser.

202
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,423
>> This is a nightmare over

203
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:29,258
here.

204
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,446
This island sucks.

205
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:51,572
There's nothing but rock.

206
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,490
You don't have enough beach

207
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,658
area.

208
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:54,867
You can't go anywhere.

209
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:55,701
There's nothing.

210
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,744
It's like pretty much a barren

211
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:57,745
land.

212
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,455
You could live on Malakal.

213
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:01,666
Over here, this is where they

214
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:02,959
bring the criminals.

215
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:03,709
>> I just want to go back to

216
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,212
Amanda.

217
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,797
>> I just want to go back.

218
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,131
>> I want to go back to Amanda

219
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,591
and Cirie and Oz.

220
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,759
>> This sucks.

221
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,844
The original Malakal alliance

222
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,429
was supposed to be myself,

223
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,390
Amanda, Parvati, Ozzy, and

224
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:18,557
Cirie.

225
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,183
But over here, it's just Parvati

226
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,559
and I.

227
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,688
So, I mean, I'm at my wit's end.

228
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,818
>> Are you nervous?

229
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:29,110
>> Not now.

230
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,112
>> Not now.

231
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,029
And if we can make it back to

232
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,365
the merge, we're fine.

233
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,371
>> That would suck.

234
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,497
At this point, six people are

235
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,541
left in this tribe, so we need a

236
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,959
very solid four to go into the

237
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:45,960
merge.

238
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:46,711
So me and James are really going

239
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:47,837
to have to pull in two more

240
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,048
people, you know, in order to

241
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,508
remain in a strong position in

242
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:54,969
this tribe.

243
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:55,803
This is how I came into this

244
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,346
game, to play in stages.

245
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,140
Like, the first stage was,

246
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,641
clearly, before the mix-up, when

247
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,059
it was fans versus favorites,

248
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,394
and just to get through that,

249
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,353
the first couple of votes.

250
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,688
And then we have the mix-up.

251
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,481
So we have to play through this

252
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,649
segment to get to the merge.

253
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,901
I just feel like I would feel

254
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,654
safe if it was you and Alexis,

255
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,240
me and James locked up at four,

256
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,158
a block of four.

257
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:17,825
>> Yeah.

258
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:18,701
I will work with you.

259
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:19,785
>> Okay.

260
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,703
>> I think that James, we can

261
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,829
still win immunity.

262
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,873
>> I think with James, we're

263
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,292
fine until the merge.

264
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,543
And then once we get to the

265
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:29,712
merge, all of the targets are

266
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,255
going to be on the big guys.

267
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,798
Like, we're going to be able to

268
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,383
slip under because everyone's

269
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,051
going to be so threatened by the

270
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,719
big guys trying to get them out.

271
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:37,053
>> Ozzy, James.

272
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,846
>> Ozzy and James are probably

273
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,097
going to be the first to go.

274
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,432
>> I'm down.

275
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,933
>> I wouldn't see anything wrong

276
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,519
with it being y'all two, me, and

277
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,021
Amanda final four.

278
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:47,897
>> Yeah, how hot would that be?

279
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,107
>> You know?

280
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:50,983
I'm not going to win against

281
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:51,817
Ozzy, and I'm not going to win

282
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,069
against James.

283
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:53,861
There's no way.

284
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:54,153
I love them.

285
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,905
I love having them around, but I

286
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:56,947
don't want to go up against them

287
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,157
at the end.

288
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,158
So I might just go ahead and

289
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,118
pull in Alexis and Natalie and

290
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:01,869
take them with me and Amanda to

291
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,788
the four.

292
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,539
Everyone else, they're dead to

293
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,209
me.

294
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,600
>> Oh.

295
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:25,726
>> Oh, my God.

296
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,977
"Choose one player from the

297
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,771
Malakal tribe to sit out today's

298
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,439
immunity challenge.

299
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,357
The person you choose will be

300
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,858
sent to Exile Island, but they

301
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,193
will be returned to their

302
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,694
tribe's camp before tonight's

303
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,987
tribal council with individual

304
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,531
immunity."

305
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,532
Tonight's tribal council with

306
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,409
individual immunity?

307
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,368
"This individual's immunity is

308
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,160
good for tonight's tribal

309
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:43,828
council only.

310
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:44,870
Circle their name on this

311
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,956
parchment, seal it in the

312
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,290
envelope, and present it to Jeff

313
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,708
at the challenge."

314
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,876
>> Wow.

315
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,836
And so Tracy was voted out.

316
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,088
>> Yeah.

317
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,131
>> We just got tree mail and

318
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,215
found out that we have an

319
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,008
immunity challenge today, which

320
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,301
is kind of shocking, because we

321
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,469
just had an immunity challenge

322
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,221
yesterday.

323
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,639
We had to pick one member of the

324
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,599
Malakal tribe to sit out of

325
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,144
today's challenge and to get

326
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,395
individual immunity at tonight's

327
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:10,563
tribal council.

328
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,730
This is huge.

329
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:12,356
>> Whose name do you think

330
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,193
they'll be circling?

331
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,236
>> "Individual immunity is good

332
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,362
for tonight's tribal council

333
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,530
only.

334
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,240
Circle their name and seal the

335
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:21,866
envelope and present it to Jeff

336
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,326
at the challenge."

337
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,244
>> Wow.

338
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,912
>> Then we got this, like,

339
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,998
hanging like this.

340
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,833
And this piece says, "Life here

341
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,586
is like a balancing act with the

342
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,296
other tribe trying to knock you

343
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,589
down."

344
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,381
>> Oh, no!

345
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,799
>> "Win this one, you're safe

346
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,968
tonight, and it'll be your tribe

347
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,012
who's chowing down."

348
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:43,554
>> I think whoever wins the

349
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,930
immunity challenge gets to go to

350
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,056
a feast, and then the other

351
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,141
tribe has to go to tribal

352
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,225
council.

353
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:48,934
>> Not both, not both.

354
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,895
>> Right, right.

355
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,521
>> So...

356
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,105
>> Who do we want to sit out?

357
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,940
>> Whoever is their best

358
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,442
balancer.

359
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,359
>> If we go to tribal council

360
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,277
tonight and I don't have

361
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,361
immunity, I'm dead.

362
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,281
So I am hoping so much that I

363
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,533
get some form of immunity here

364
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,327
and survive this tribal council

365
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,704
tonight.

366
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,798
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

367
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,849
Airai, getting your first look

368
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,769
at the new Malakal tribe.

369
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:32,353
Tracy voted out at the last

370
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,980
tribal council.

371
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,658
You guys ready to get to it?

372
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,575
>> Yeah.

373
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,368
>> PROBST: This morning in tree

374
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,536
mail, you were instructed to

375
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,246
select one member from the other

376
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,456
tribe to sit out of today's

377
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:52,915
immunity challenge.

378
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:53,999
This person will not

379
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,042
participate.

380
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,877
Instead, they will go to Exile

381
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:00,005
Island with individual immunity.

382
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,633
Here's what that means.

383
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,635
If their tribe loses and they

384
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:05,928
have to go to tribal council,

385
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,596
they cannot be voted out.

386
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,473
That immunity is good only for

387
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,308
tonight's tribal council, only

388
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,810
if your tribe goes to tribal

389
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,060
council.

390
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,812
Make sense?

391
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:15,563
>> Yeah.

392
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,522
>> PROBST: You guys both made

393
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,481
your selections?

394
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,148
>> Yeah.

395
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,234
>> PROBST: I'll come get them.

396
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,866
To sit out of today's challenge,

397
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,953
Airai selected Ozzy.

398
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,997
To sit out of the challenge,

399
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,791
Malakal selected-- originally,

400
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:37,876
it was James.

401
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,964
They changed it to Alexis.

402
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,716
Ami, tell me about that.

403
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,216
Why the change of heart?

404
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,968
>> She seems like she could

405
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,344
balance, and it seemed like it

406
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,304
was about balance, so we decided

407
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,888
to get rid of Alexis.

408
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:50,973
>> PROBST: Alexis, Ozzy, get

409
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,058
your stuff.

410
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,144
Boat's waiting on you.

411
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,735
Right down there.

412
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:03,485
All right, you guys ready to get

413
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,820
to today's challenge?

414
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:05,821
>> How about what we're playing

415
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:06,488
for?

416
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,698
>> PROBST: How about first you

417
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,033
give me immunity back?

418
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:12,703
How about that?

419
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,622
Once again, immunity is back up

420
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,708
for grabs.

421
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,335
On my go, one tribe member at a

422
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,462
time will attempt to navigate an

423
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,380
obstacle course while members of

424
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,215
the other tribe attempt to knock

425
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,217
you off by swinging heavy canvas

426
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,260
bags.

427
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,178
When you reach the end, you'll

428
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,929
grab a flag, try to make your

429
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,139
way back.

430
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,182
If you fall off at any point

431
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,060
along the way, you have to make

432
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,395
your way back to the start and

433
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,855
the next person goes.

434
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:40,939
First tribe to collect five

435
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,609
flags wins.

436
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:44,443
Want to know what you're playing

437
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,527
for?

438
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,528
>> Definitely.

439
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,404
>> PROBST: Winning tribe,

440
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,656
immunity.

441
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,824
In addition, pizza and beer

442
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,117
delivered to your camp this

443
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,202
afternoon.

444
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,078
>> Oh, my God!

445
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,038
>> Pizza.

446
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:56,622
>> PROBST: Worth playing for?

447
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,998
>> Yes.

448
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:58,582
>> PROBST: Airai, you have one

449
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,958
extra member-- sitting somebody

450
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:00,709
out.

451
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,503
Who's it going to be?

452
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,212
>> I'm going to sit out.

453
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,129
>> PROBST: Parvati, take a spot

454
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:04,463
on the bench.

455
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,798
Everybody else, I'll give you a

456
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:06,882
minute to strategize.

457
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:08,967
We'll get started.

458
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,388
All right, here we go.

459
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,806
Running the course for Airai,

460
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,432
Eliza and Jason.

461
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,059
Swinging the bags for Airai,

462
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,019
Natalie and James.

463
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,521
For Malakal, running the course,

464
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,147
Erik and Amanda.

465
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,982
Swinging the bags, Ami and

466
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,401
Cirie.

467
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,569
For immunity and reward in the

468
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,196
form of pizza and beer.

469
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,240
Survivors ready.

470
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,243
Go!

471
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,954
Erik leaps across the stepping

472
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,790
stones, makes his way across the

473
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,584
barrel, missing the bags.

474
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,627
James tries to hit him, just

475
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,255
misses.

476
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,799
Erik and Jason both across the

477
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:49,341
first part of this course.

478
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,802
>> Come on, Erik!

479
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,096
>> Good job, Jason!

480
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:54,680
>> PROBST: You got to get all

481
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,348
the way back while missing those

482
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,057
bags.

483
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,058
James launches and hits Erik on

484
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:01,228
the head, but it's not enough.

485
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,274
Erik hanging on, almost falls

486
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,735
off, but doesn't.

487
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,444
Nice save!

488
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,069
>> Come on, Erik!

489
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:09,903
>> Good job, Jason.

490
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:10,779
>> PROBST: Jason's across for

491
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,613
Airai with one.

492
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,532
Erik's across.

493
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,700
Eliza falls.

494
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,786
Amanda falls off for Malakal.

495
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,500
Erik once again leaps across the

496
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,211
stepping stones.

497
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,212
Nobody having any luck with the

498
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,674
bags yet.

499
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,009
Erik working the balance beam.

500
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:35,721
He eludes the bags.

501
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,472
Jason coming back with the

502
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,558
second flag for Airai.

503
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,940
We are tied 1-1.

504
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,735
>> Come on, Erik, you got it.

505
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:50,652
>> PROBST: Jason having no

506
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,403
trouble.

507
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,780
Airai now leads 2-1.

508
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:53,405
>> Come on, Eliza!

509
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,031
>> PROBST: Erik coming back with

510
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,074
that second flag.

511
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:56,867
>> Go, go, go.

512
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,743
>> PROBST: Erik back with the

513
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:58,911
second flag for Malakal.

514
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,287
We're tied, 2-2.

515
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,750
Amanda hanging on.

516
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,959
Eliza falls off.

517
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,586
She's got to head back.

518
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,253
Amanda with a nice save.

519
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,464
>> Come on.

520
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,673
>> PROBST: Amanda trying to

521
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,758
tippytoe around that barrel.

522
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,218
Amanda takes a hard hit and

523
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:18,180
survives.

524
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,600
Amanda's halfway there.

525
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:22,392
>> Get him, get him, get him!

526
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,018
>> PROBST: Jason right behind

527
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:23,936

528
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:27,064
We are tied 2-2.

529
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,942
>> Come on, Amanda!

530
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,276
>> PROBST: Amanda back at the

531
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,278
balance beam.

532
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,863
Bags being tossed.

533
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,115
James aiming for Amanda, just

534
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,492
misses.

535
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:39,576
Cirie just misses on Jason.

536
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,662
Amanda, slow going, but no

537
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,330
trouble for Jason.

538
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,624
>> Good job, Amanda!

539
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:46,291
>> PROBST: Amanda's across.

540
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,169

Erik leaps again.

542
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,090
Eliza's there.

543
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,592
Eliza's got it.

544
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,343
>> Good job, girl, good job.

545
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,845
>> PROBST: We are tied 3-3, neck

546

>> Just focus, Erik.

548
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,350
Go!

549
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,310
>> PROBST: Erik across the

550
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,979
barrels, across the beam, just

551
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,857

>> PROBST: Eliza back with the

557
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:21,743
fourth flag.

558
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,452
Got to get across the stepping

559
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,998
stones.

560
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,207
Airai leads 4-3.

We're tied 4-4.

00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,754
One flag left for both tribes.

564
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,673

565
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:35,966
>> PROBST: Erik going back out

566
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,092
and takes a hard hit!

567
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:38,218
He's out.

568
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,930
>> Come on, Amanda!

569
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:42,472
>> PROBST: Erik smashed hard

570
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:47,311

Amanda falls off.

572

Malakal, here's what's going to

happen.

00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,451
Ozzy will return to your camp

He cannot be voted for, which

00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,415
means one of the four of you are

00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,106
Who took that really hard fall?

00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,273
>> Erik.

610
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:15,732
>> Where did you hit?

611
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,109
>> My chest.

612
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,360
>> Are you okay?

613
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:18,527
>> No.

00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,279
>> That hurt like crazy.

616
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,990
That challenge today was rough.

617
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,074
I mean, that was tough without

618
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:24,533
Ozzy there today.

619
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,868
I tried my damnedest, because

620
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,912
that was my last real attempt, I

621
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,080
think, that I could have.

622
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,165
But it was not happening.

623
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:32,499
It hurts.

624
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,333
I'm not going to lie.

625
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:37,337
That was pretty bad.

626
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,339
>> I think Erik is a genuine,

627
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,507
good person.

628
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,550
I really wish we would have won

629
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,509
today, because I would have

630
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,845
loved to have seen Erik stay.

631
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,304
But I don't see any way out for

632
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,973
him right now.

633
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,350
I don't see any way out for him.

635
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,029

636
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,572
>> Good job, team!

637
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,115
>> How long we've been dying.

638
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:05,907
>> Those dreams paid off.

639
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,577
Dreams paid off.

640
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,496
>> Good job.

641
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,331
>> Thank you.

642
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:13,957
I'd definitely say I was the MVP

643
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,542
today.

644
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,169
I think I brought back four of

645
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,171
the five flags, and I had a

646
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,213
great time.

647
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,882
But right now, I definitely feel

648
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,216
scared about my position over

649
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,426
here.

650
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,552
Luckily, I hold the hidden

651
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,720
immunity idol.

652
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,096
But other than that, you know, I

653
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,139
can't really count on any

654
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:29,514
alliances.

655
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,558
And you know, I'm just going to

656
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,560
have to compete at 110% at every

657
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,896
challenge, or it could be the

658
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:36,438
end of the game for me.

659
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,440
>> Good job on that challenge.

660
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:38,815
Y'all were great.

661
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,567
>> Good job.

662
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,943
>> Jason and Eliza pretty much

663
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,612
tore up that course, and we won.

664
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,530
I think they both kind of know

665
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,490
they're on the outs, so they

666
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,491
both gave it their all at this

667
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,575

668
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:49,576
other.

669
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:52,496
And I am so happy.

00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,831
I don't think I'll be having rat

671
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:55,582
for dinner tonight.

672
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,417
Pizza party!

pulled up, and we had four

682

710
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:09,447
I spent hours searching this

711
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,575
part of the beach, but the

712
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,201

713
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,286
>> ...go back to the beginning.

718
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,669
here, so I want to find out if

719
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:23,712
somebody else found the immunity

720
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:27,716

00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,053
Maybe this other little

outcropping over here.

726
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:43,732
This is over your head.

727
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:44,566
>> See, that's what I was

728
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,276
thinking, a tree or something

Ha-ha, someone's taken the bait.

Yes, yes, yes!

I don't know who, but it's gone.

It's not here.

Who is going to be tricked by

Why can't we win?

>> It's been forever.

>> It's sad.

746
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,235
>> But at the same time, you

747
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,861
have to remember Erik's a gamer.

748
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:30,737
>> He's competitive, man.

749
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:30,987
>> Uh-huh.

750
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:31,613
>> I still remember when he

751
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,740
dropped me on my freaking head.

752
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:34,991
>> Uh-huh.

753
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:35,784
>> Like, he's different in

I'm this close to maybe making

763
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,936
the next level, making the next

764
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,604
set of alliances that can lead

765
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,982
me to the end of this game.

766
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:07,857
I feel like I'm on my last legs,

767
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:08,942
though.

768
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:09,693
I mean, all the fans are dead in

769
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,735
this tribe.

770
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,362
All the favorites have the

771
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:12,696
control.

772
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,656
But I'm trying to work with what

773
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:15,615
I have, and I'm pretty desperate

774
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,868
right now.

775
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,209
How well do you guys trust Ami?

776
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,002
>> Huh?

777
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:27,627
>> How well do you guys trust

778
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,005
Ami?

779
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:30,672
>> I don't know.

780
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:30,839
Why?

781
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:31,715
>> Because she's been trying to

782
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,550
get something together with

783
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:37,095
Airai since probably Joel left.

784
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:37,679
And when Chet was here, she

785
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,015
wanted to go with us to vote one

786
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,433
of you guys.

787
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,143
And then when it was just Tracy,

788
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,312
me, and her, she tried to sway

789
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,647
one of you guys, and that didn't

790
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,774
happen, so Tracy left.

791
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,818
(<i> laughter</i> )

792
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:52,819
She's told me about different

793
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:53,987
alliances that you guys have

794
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,821
had.

795
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:55,864
She said that she was part of

796
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,657
Yau-Man's alliance, and she said

797
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,242
she had nowhere to go, and

798
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,202
that's why she came to me and

799
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,829
Chet and Tracy.

800
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,664
I really don't want to hurt her,

801
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:05,874
because I really like Ami a lot.

802
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:06,916
I like Ami a lot.

803
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,709
She's such a good person.

804
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:08,877
But this isn't about people

805
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,587
anymore.

806
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,296
>> Right, right.

807
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:11,880
>> This is about the game.

808
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:12,672
>> Uh-huh.

809
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:13,256
>> And I want you guys to know

810
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,425
that if you decide Ami, I'll be

811
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,968
in with that.

812
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:23,683
>> Wow.

813
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,769
You don't know who to trust

814
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:25,977
here.

815
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,146
You have Erik fighting for his

816
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,898
life, who will say anything

817
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,441
right now, who will sell his

818
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:32,734
soul to the devil to stay.

819
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,778
And then you have Ami, who has

820
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:38,406
proven time and time again that

821
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,032
she can't be trusted-- that I

822
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,742
can't trust her.

823
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,160
>> I'm trying to save my neck

824
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:42,869
here.

825
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:45,955
So that's why I do whatever.

826
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:56,800
That's all I have.

827
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:59,636
Take it, leave it, pretend it's

828
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:00,804
lies, whatever, but that's

829
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:03,390
everything that I've heard.

830
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,766
>> See, the problem is I don't

831
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,852
trust Ami, but I don't trust

832
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:08,853
Erik either.

833
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,814
So my dilemma is who do I trust

834
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:14,234
the least?

835
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,764
So I was walking down the beach,

836
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:45,932
and I came back to camp, and

837
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:46,808
there's Erik just spilling the

838
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,978
beans, just going out about

839
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,271
every single thing that's gone

840
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,982
down since the swap.

841
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:54,858
I don't feel like I've done

842
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,902
anything to hurt you, have you?

843
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:58,778
I've stuck by you 100%, and I

844
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:02,532
always will.

845
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,077
He's trying everything in his

846
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:06,828
right mind...

847
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:07,745
>> No, I understand.

848
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:07,996
I know.

849
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,789
And I don't blame him.

850
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:10,999
>> No, neither do I.

851
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,751
>> If I vote either Ami or Erik,

852
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:14,335
it's going to be risky either

853
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,796
way.

854
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,882
Erik probably still has his

855
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:21,342
alliance with the fans, and if

856
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,178
they could get Eliza, that could

857
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,804
be a problem.

858
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,139
But it's the same thing with

859
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,557
Ami.

860
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,809
She could grab Eliza and go with

861
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,936
Jason, Natalie, and Alexis and

862
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,062
cause problems.

863
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:36,357
So I don't know.

864
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:36,941
Just with all the skittishness

865
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,943
and all the...

866
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,196
>> Well, you guys, I was the

867
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,865
last one, period, to even be,

868
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,033
like, talked to about being with

869
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:45,867
you guys.

870
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:46,910
You guys didn't ever even ask

871
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,536
me.

872
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,496
>> I know, because we thought

873
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,121
you were with Eliza and those

874
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:50,330
guys.

875
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,414
>> Yeah, but I was.

876
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:51,956
>> I know.

877
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,749
>> And then after that...

878
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:56,419
>> So why would we then?

879
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,795
>> Well, yeah, but since then,

880
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,047
you guys have never come

881
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,006
together and really said, "Okay,

882
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,007
Ami, we want you to be really a

883
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,092
part of this and totally into

884
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,302
this; like, we're watching your

885
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,845
back, no matter what."

886
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,055
I want to stick with you guys

887
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,890
the whole way and feel like I'm

888
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:09,974
part of you guys.

889
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,684
>> Right.

890
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:12,644
>> But nobody has really said,

891
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,521
"Hey, Ami, we want to fight with

892
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:15,021
you."

893
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,773
>> Well, we want to fight with

894
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:17,315
you.

895
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:22,445
>> Okay, thanks.

896
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,738
>> We don't know Erik like we

897
00:30:23,821 --> 00:30:24,906
know Ami.

898
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,241
Like, we know we can't trust

899
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:26,908
Ami, and it's almost better with

900
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,993
the devil you know rather than

901
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,828
the devil you don't know.

902
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,663
I feel like we should have,

903
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:32,288
like, a group hug or something.

904
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,457
>> Okay, good, thanks.

905
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:37,460
>> Oh.

906
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,471
We just had a really good talk.

907
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,056
>> That's what I wanted, yeah.

908
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:50,932
>> That's not what you wanted.

909
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,058
>> That's not what I wanted,

910
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,560
but...

911
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,895
>> Right.

912
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,111
And so you...

913
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,779
>> Well opening that up to them

914
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:05,405
to...

915
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,114
>> Yeah.

916
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,448
Thank you.

917
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,033
Thank you.

918
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:12,662
>> No problem.

919
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,497
Things were looking pretty bad,

920
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:15,790
and I still think they're

921
00:31:15,873 --> 00:31:18,668
looking pretty bad.

922
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,044
I don't want to give up.

923
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,004
I don't want to admit defeat,

924
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:24,048
but it's so hard to keep going.

925
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,174
We'll also have to see what Ozzy

926
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,092
has to say when he comes back

927
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,094
from Exile.

928
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:28,636
I definitely want to talk to

929
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,597
Ozzy about the future.

930
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,598
I definitely want to ask him

931
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,266
about how he feels with his

932
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,726
alliance and how he feels about

933
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,060
taking me with him.

934
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:39,022
>> How'd it go?

935
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,732
No way!

936
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,066
Are you serious?

937
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,945
>> Yeah.

938
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,250
>> Yeah.

939
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:02,503
>> I came back from Exile, and

940
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,047
as soon as I jump off the boat,

941
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:04,672
there was Erik looking like a

942
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,550
lost puppy dog.

943
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,968
He came right up to me and said,

944
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,470
"I know it's a long shot, but

945
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,179
I've got to tell you something

946
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,056
about Ami."

947
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,932
>> Ami was trying to do

948
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,684
something with me, Tracy, and

949
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,269
Chet.

950
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,228
And then it was down to Tracy

951
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,313
and me, she was trying to sway

952
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,981
either Cirie or Amanda to do

953
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:25,860
whatever.

954
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:26,486
>> So you're being totally

955
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:27,195
honest that Ami was...

956
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,112
>> Yes, yes.

957
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,448
>> Did Ami try and get me out?

958
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:31,449
>> Yes.

959
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,492
>> Okay.

960
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:33,743
>> I'm going to write down Ami

961
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:34,410
tonight.

962
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,620
I just want you to know that.

963
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:36,245
>> All right.

964
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,080
>> And I would like you to help

965
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,831
me, as a fellow competitor, to

966
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,583
stay in this game.

967
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,085
>> Okay.

968
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,128
The way I play this game, as

969
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,254
soon as someone makes a move

970
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,006
against me, that's it.

971
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:47,590
I'm going to do whatever I can

972
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:48,174
to get them out as fast as I

973
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:50,009
can.

974
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,552
And that's what Ami did.

975
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:55,181
Erik, on the other hand, given

976
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:56,182
the opportunity, I think he will

977
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,559
prove trustworthy, and I'm

978
00:32:58,643 --> 00:32:59,936
willing to take that chance and

979
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,230
that risk.

980
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:14,575
>> And that makes sense, but...

981
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,662
but I still think that Ami...

982
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,122
>> We can't trust Ami at all.

983
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,081
>> No?

984
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:20,998
>> No.

985
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:21,582
>> Well...

986
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:22,291
>> You know what I found out

987
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,627
from Erik?

988
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,004
Ami was trying to get me out.

989
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:30,383
Ami's a lying little snot.

990
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:30,925
>> Who can we trust more,

991
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:32,343
though?

992
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,845
>> Erik.

993
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,096
>> I don't think so.

994
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:35,513
>> You think Ami?

995
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,265
>> At least we know what Ami is

996
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,599
capable of and what she's here

997
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,267
to... how she's here to play.

998
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,226
Erik is more dangerous than he

999
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,061
appears.

1000
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:45,273
>> So is Ami.

1001
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:49,068
>> I don't know.

1002
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,383
>> PROBST: Four times in a row.

1003
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,343
Cirie, you're clearly the

1004
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,220
inferior tribe at this point.

1005
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:19,432
>> It's horrible.

1006
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,434
We just can't figure out why we

1007
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:22,852
keep losing.

1008
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,104
And it sucks around camp for

1009
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,272
morale for us.

1010
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,274
>> PROBST: Erik, interesting

1011
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,067
situation you're in right now,

1012
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:30,651
because the last three people

1013
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,570
voted off have been fans.

1014
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,155
There's only one fan left.

1015
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,907
>> I know.

1016
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,158
I understand that the fans have

1017
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,076
been going, one after another,

1018
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,828
and I understand that I could be

1019
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,079
the one tonight.

1020
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,289
I mean, I feel hopeless.

1021
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:45,166
A week ago, I was happy, and to

1022
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,667
have it go this way, it baffles

1023
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,920
me.

1024
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:49,504
>> PROBST: Ozzy, looks to me

1025
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,798
like it's favorites versus fans

1026
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,633
still, in a lot of ways.

1027
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:55,510
>> Yeah, alliances were made to

1028
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,303
people that you feel the most

1029
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,222
trust, and that's how we came to

1030
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,557
be a tribe in the beginning, the

1031
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,266
favorites.

1032
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,143
But all of a sudden, the game

1033
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,729
gets in the way, and the

1034
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:07,271
favorites that might feel

1035
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,314
they're at the bottom of the

1036
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:10,858
pecking order start playing the

1037
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,402
fans, start playing both sides

1038
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,237
of the spectrum, and that's when

1039
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,155
it starts getting a little bit

1040
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,240
funky.

1041
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:19,367
And now I'm starting to realize

1042
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,536
that certain things are not what

1043
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,580
they seem.

1044
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,331
>> PROBST: Ami, you're tearing

1045
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,499
up.

1046
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:27,750
>> Well, I obviously know Ozzy

1047
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,252
is talking about me right now.

1048
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,294
>> Why would you think that?

1049
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:33,381
>> Because I know Erik has been

1050
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,175
all day long saying how I've

1051
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,343
been playing both sides and all

1052
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:38,636
of that.

1053
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,805
>> To be honest, the day that

1054
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,765
the fans arrived, Ami said, "I

1055
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,141
need some help.

1056
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:44,600
You guys are numbers."

1057
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,394
>> Yeah, I could have gone with

1058
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,854
those guys the first vote--

1059
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:48,646
could have.

1060
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:49,647
It would have been easy.

1061
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,107
We had the numbers to do it.

1062
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,775
And I didn't.

1063
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:53,359
It's just now that finally I

1064
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,695
feel like I'm part of the tribe,

1065
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,113
you're telling me that,

1066
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,990
"Whatever, I don't trust her, I

1067
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,074
don't believe her."

1068
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:01,033
>> How have we ever made you

1069
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:01,909
feel like you're not part of the

1070
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:02,910
tribe?

1071
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,203
We've always been together.

1072
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,205
We've always had the plan to try

1073
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,456
and keep us as strong as

1074
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,541
possible as...

1075
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:09,709
>> But I haven't always felt

1076
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:10,626
like I'm part of the tribe.

1077
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,044
You guys go off, and you make

1078
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:12,670
decisions that you don't ask me

1079
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,005
about.

1080
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:14,547
>> When?

1081
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,298
>> Like when you guys were

1082
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,215
making decisions for the first

1083
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,425
few times with everybody else,

1084
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,885
it didn't include me.

1085
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,052
You guys made the decisions.

1086
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,262
>> I just want to know were you

1087
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,806
gunning for me with Tracy and

1088
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,266
Erik, or were you not?

1089
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,350
>> There is no way I would have

1090
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,393
ever voted for you with Tracy

1091
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,645
and Erik, ever.

1092
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:30,855
I was giving them hope and

1093
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,064
letting them have a good,

1094
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,232
peaceful camp, and there is no

1095
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,484
way I would have ever voted for

1096
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,069
you, ever, Ozzy.

1097
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,154
The only way I would vote for

1098
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:38,946
you is to win the million

1099
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,533
dollars, period.

1100
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,409
>> PROBST: Cirie, take me

1101
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,869
through the dilemma.

1102
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,037
It's easy to keep with what

1103
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:46,662
you've been doing and get rid of

1104
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:47,413
the next fan, and we've still

1105
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,916
got four favorites together.

1106
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,375
Now Ami's in question.

1107
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,044
How do you make a decision on

1108
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:53,669
which way to go?-- because it's

1109
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,755
a huge vote.

1110
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,590
>> I think all the favorites

1111
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:00,468
have a mutual respect for each

1112
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,385
other, and you know, it's like

1113
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,304
the home team.

1114
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,847
You don't want the visitors to

1115
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,850
come in and win the game.

1116
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:08,351
(<i> sighing</i> )

1117
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,728
I think you just have to go with

1118
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,772
your gut feeling, what you'll

1119
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:13,314
believe and what you're not

1120
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,858
going to believe.

1121
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:16,817
>> PROBST: Amanda, take me

1122
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:17,818
through the part of you that

1123
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,278
wants to believe Ami.

1124
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,364
Maybe Ami is telling the truth.

1125
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:22,740
>> I think Ami is, honestly,

1126
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,159
like, a really good person.

1127
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:26,035
We've gotten close.

1128
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:26,661
We've been a tribe for 20-some

1129
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,830
days now, and I want to believe

1130
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,332
what she's saying.

1131
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,333
>> PROBST: Ozzy, give me your

1132
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:37,213
take on what's happening here.

1133
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,047
>> God, I really want to trust

1134
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,924
Ami.

1135
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:40,383
I really do.

1136
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:43,177
And I feel like I have, for the

1137
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,553
most part, for the whole, entire

1138
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,721
game.

1139
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,098
>> It just kills me that he says

1140
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,641
he wants to.

1141
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:52,019
I can't believe that he doesn't.

1142
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:52,853
>> PROBST: Clearly, tonight's

1143
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:53,354
vote is about one simple

1144
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,482
quality: trust.

1145
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,442
Erik, why should they believe

1146
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,277
your story?

1147
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:00,820
>> I have no other option.

1148
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,780
I feel that I'm backed up

1149
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:03,781
against the wall, and I said,

1150
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:04,782
"You know what?

1151
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:05,700
The truth is fine."

1152
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,201
And I have to tell it in hopes

1153
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:07,743
that they would see that and

1154
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,121
say, "Yeah, Ami is not

1155
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,163
trustworthy," or, "Ami is a

1156
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,665
threat to the tribe well-being

1157
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,458
and to us, as individuals, after

1158
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,501
the merge."

1159
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:16,752
That's all I have.

1160
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:17,795
That's all I have to give was

1161
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,880
that.

1162
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,090
>> PROBST: Ami, why should this

1163
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:23,509
tribe believe your story?

1164
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:24,635
>> I'm going to set aside all

1165
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:25,970
the past of where I've voted and

1166
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,555
what I've done and all that.

1167
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,181
They know where I'm coming from.

1168
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:29,807
The biggest thing is is my heart

1169
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,809
is in this.

1170
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,144
I want to fight for this tribe.

1171
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,687
I want to stick together.

1172
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,480
I don't want to go out now.

1173
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,149
We have so much more that we can

1174
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,358
conquer together.

1175
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,526
I want to fight as hard as I can

1176
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,361
in every challenge.

1177
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,654
I've looked you in the eyes, and

1178
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,698
you know you can trust me.

1179
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:47,033
I know you know it.

1180
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,159
I know you know it without

1181
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,118
words.

1182
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:52,079
And I know you do too.

1183
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:52,621
Erik is a really good guy.

1184
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,582
He's doing the best he can.

1185
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,292
I have everything invested in

1186
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,335
this.

1187
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:57,877
I want to keep Parvati in.

1188
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,503
I want to keep James in.

1189
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,214
I even want to keep Eliza in.

1190
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,132
I want to be here.

1191
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,425
I swear I'll give you everything

1192
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:08,721
I have.

1193
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:09,680
>> PROBST: It's time to get to

1194
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,556
the vote.

1195
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:11,557
Ozzy has immunity for tonight's

1196
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,393
tribal council only because he

1197
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,644
did not participate in the

1198
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:16,687
challenge.

1199
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,355
Everybody else is fair game.

1200
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,732
It is time to vote.

1201
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:22,818
Amanda, you're up.

1202
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:36,832
>> I don't even know what to

1203
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:37,750
say, Erik.

1204
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,836
You're a good guy.

1205
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,307
>> Ami, you're an awesome,

1206
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,642
awesome woman.

1207
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:55,601
I'm sorry it had to come to

1208
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:56,769
this.

1209
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:57,728
What can I say?

1210
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,481
This game's hell.

1211
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,373
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1212
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,582
votes.

1213
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:28,551
If anybody has the hidden

1214
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:29,677
immunity idol and you want to

1215
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,719
play it, now would be the time

1216
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,597
to do so.

1217
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,598
Okay, once the votes are read,

1218
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:35,558
the decision is final.

1219
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:36,475
Person voted out will be asked

1220
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,560
to leave the tribal council area

1221
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:38,686
immediately.

1222
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,772
I'll read the votes.

1223
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,610
First vote, Ami.

1224
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:52,283
Erik.

1225
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:53,659
One vote Ami, one vote Erik.

1226
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,123
Ami.

1227
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,876
Two votes Ami, one vote Erik.

1228
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,423
Eighth person voted out of

<i>Survivor: Fans vs. Favorites,</i>

1230
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:09,884
Ami.

1231
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:10,217
That's three.

1232
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,218
That's enough.

1233
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:14,138
You need to bring me your torch.

1234
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,147
>> You guys better start

1235
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,648
winning.

1236
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,317
>> PROBST: Ami, the tribe has

1237
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,778
spoken.

1238
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,865
Time for you to go.

1239
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,703
>> Good luck, you guys.

1240
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:45,628
>> PROBST: Well, tonight's vote

1241
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,338
seems to speak to the idea that

1242
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:47,922
sometimes you've got to listen

1243
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,632
to your gut and act on it.

1244
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,509
Clearly, that is what you guys

1245
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:52,718
did tonight.

1246
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:53,093
Grab your torches.

1247
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,386
Head back to camp.

1248
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,889

>> It's not the idol.

1270

>> Why do you say that?

1271
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,341
>> Because that can't be the

1272
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:33,175
idol.

1273
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:33,884
>> Why not?

1274
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:34,885
>> Because it's just a stick.

1275
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,059
>> It kills me that Ozzy and

1276
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:42,685
Amanda didn't trust me, that I'm

1277
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:43,769
not still there playing with

1278
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:45,479
them.

1279
00:42:45,562 --> 00:42:46,105
The one day I finally feel like

1280
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,148
I'm part of something, it's the

1281
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:48,732
day I get voted out.

1282
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,859
This game definitely plays

1283
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,152
tricks on you.

1284
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:52,778
You learn a lot about yourself.

1285
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:53,737
Like, I really need to keep my

1286
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,614
head up.

1287
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,616
I really need to stay strong.

1288
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,200
I'm blessed that I got to play

1289
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,619
this game twice.
