182

"The betrayal."

Dude,
we were on the opposite sides.

184

There's no betrayal here.
You betray me, I betray you.

What's the freaking problem?

186

What I'm afraid is
that Josh's perception of me

187

is gonna affect
other people's perception.

191

five days ago

192
00:07:20,655 --> 00:07:22,482

left me out of the Sarah vote.

wants to still work with me.

194

so much work to do here.

Yeah.

198

I mean, it sounds crazy,
but the plan

199
00:07:39,344 --> 00:07:41,586
legitimately is to get Josh out.

200
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:44,034
We wanted
to get rid of Josh at Soka,

201
00:07:44,137 --> 00:07:46,793
but Josh swapped tribes,
and we thought, "Oh, he's done."

202
00:07:46,896 --> 00:07:49,896
And then, again,
he has dodged a Tribal Council

203
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,206
and made it to this merge.

204
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,068

definitely has nine lives.

00:14:07,827 --> 00:14:09,724
in whether or not
you have immunity and live

346
00:14:09,827 --> 00:14:11,716
to see another day or whether
you go to Tribal Council.

347
00:14:11,758 --> 00:14:14,517
This game is certainly
a lot of skill, but, uh,

348
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,862
I don't think anybody would say
it doesn't have some luck to it.

349
00:14:17,965 --> 00:14:19,000
All right.

350
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:23,620
Moment of truth.
Everybody put your palms out.

351
00:14:23,724 --> 00:14:24,624

And reveal.

353
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,724
If you are orange,
head to orange.

00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,310
If you're purple,
head to purple.

355
00:14:30,413 --> 00:14:31,965
Let's see what we have.

356
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:35,655
Looks like
a pretty even division.

357
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:37,344
YAM YAM: Yes, we got this, guys.

358
00:14:37,448 --> 00:14:39,379

366
00:14:59,172 --> 00:15:00,517
Here we go.

367
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,379
For immunity,

368
00:15:02,482 --> 00:15:06,517
for a Buff, for a merge meal.

369
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,689
Here we go. Survivors ready?

370
00:15:10,413 --> 00:15:11,896
Go!

371
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,206
First thing you got to do

372
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,430
JAIME: You got this, guys...

People are hungry.
You want that certainty.

You want to earn that Buff

Here goes orange.

380
00:15:31,482 --> 00:15:33,620

00:15:35,344 --> 00:15:37,758
PROBST: That ball is
moving, and it's out of the hole.

HEIDI: Yes.

385
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:42,440

Here comes purple.

387
00:15:44,586 --> 00:15:46,310

Up and over.

391
00:15:53,172 --> 00:15:55,517
Now you got to work together
again to get that heavy ball

392
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,448
- up and over this obstacle.
- [grunting]

393

Everybody working.

[Carolyn groans]

396
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:06,241

[grunting]

401
00:16:11,758 --> 00:16:13,862
Can they get
control of it again?

402
00:16:13,965 --> 00:16:16,448
They do. Is it enough? It is.

403
00:16:17,448 --> 00:16:19,103

It's gonna be purple.

409

Go around, someone go around.

00:20:12,862 --> 00:20:15,137
Down to two pieces left
for purple.

516
00:20:15,241 --> 00:20:16,862
An absolute blowout
with another piece.

517
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,000
[indistinct chatter]

518
00:20:18,103 --> 00:20:19,413
BRANDON: Let's go, Carson.

519
00:20:19,517 --> 00:20:20,785
PROBST: Carson
with the last piece for purple.

520
00:20:20,827 --> 00:20:22,517
- Yes. Yes. Yes!
- There it is.

521
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,000
Purple wins immunity,

522
00:20:26,103 --> 00:20:29,172
safe tonight at Tribal Council.
All will make the next stage

523
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:31,931
in this game.

524
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:33,655
What a challenge.

525
00:20:33,758 --> 00:20:36,103
You were neck-and-neck
until the end.

526
00:20:36,206 --> 00:20:38,137
And it was over.

527
00:20:39,965 --> 00:20:41,758
Good job.

528
00:20:43,724 --> 00:20:46,206
Purple, a lot
of emotion down here.

529
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:49,068
What's going on, Jaime?
There's a lot of tears.

530
00:20:49,172 --> 00:20:50,896
I just didn't want
to let my team down,

531
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,344
especially with the wall.

532
00:20:52,448 --> 00:20:55,275
I'm so grateful
that they were there to catch me

533
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:59,310
when I fell and to help me up
all the way. [Crying]

534
00:20:59,413 --> 00:21:01,827
Carson, I'll give these to you.
You won that.

535
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:04,379
- Yeah. Yeah...
- Take those Buffs, put them on.

536
00:21:04,482 --> 00:21:08,310
You have earned your way into
the next stage of this game.

537
00:21:08,413 --> 00:21:12,000
Nice job, everybody safe,
food coming for you.

538
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:13,655
For the other six,

539
00:21:13,758 --> 00:21:15,613
one of you will be
the seventh person voted out.

540
00:21:15,655 --> 00:21:18,482
Grab your stuff, head out. See
you tonight at Tribal Council.

541
00:21:19,758 --> 00:21:22,551
CARSON:
I am just, like, beyond ecstatic

542
00:21:22,655 --> 00:21:24,551
because
all my hard work paid off.

543
00:21:24,655 --> 00:21:27,137
I have a 3D print
of this puzzle in my house,

544
00:21:27,241 --> 00:21:29,758
and put it together
probably a thousand times.

545
00:21:29,862 --> 00:21:32,827
I think it's a lesson that
you should always be prepared.

546
00:21:32,931 --> 00:21:35,068
And now I've made the merge.

547
00:21:35,172 --> 00:21:37,052
It's definitely one
of the best days of my life.

548
00:21:44,827 --> 00:21:47,000
If you want this, you got
to apply to be on Survivor.

549
00:21:55,931 --> 00:21:57,862
I wonder what they're eating.

550
00:21:57,965 --> 00:22:01,448
YAM YAM: So I come back
to the camp with the six losers,

551
00:22:01,551 --> 00:22:03,689
me being one of them.

552
00:22:03,793 --> 00:22:06,074
First thing I think is like,
"Oh, my God, I'm in trouble."

553
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,206
And being one
of only six targets,

554
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:15,000
I have no meal,
no Buff, no hope.

555
00:22:15,103 --> 00:22:16,965
What am I gonna do?

556
00:22:17,068 --> 00:22:18,413
What's your plan then, Yam?

557
00:22:18,517 --> 00:22:20,302
I have no idea 'cause
it's one of them, I think.

558
00:22:20,344 --> 00:22:23,103
- So, who are you thinking?
- Josh. It is what it is.

559
00:22:23,206 --> 00:22:25,586
It's always been me against him.

560
00:22:25,689 --> 00:22:28,482
Josh hasn't been talking to me
since we got to this beach.

561
00:22:28,586 --> 00:22:30,827
Who else am I gonna say?
It's obvious we don't get along.

562
00:22:30,931 --> 00:22:34,344
I'm gonna do whatever they...
whatever they come back and say.

563
00:22:34,448 --> 00:22:36,689
- Yeah.
- I mean, if they come back and say, "Josh,"

564
00:22:36,793 --> 00:22:38,137
I'm in, so... I mean, I would...

565
00:22:38,241 --> 00:22:39,724
If I was you,
I would be less worried

566
00:22:39,827 --> 00:22:41,482
about talking to me and Kane.

567
00:22:41,586 --> 00:22:44,517
YAM YAM: Danny did not
react too well to the idea.

568
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,100
He wanted to wait
for the six winners.

569
00:22:46,172 --> 00:22:48,068
I just opened my mouth
when I shouldn't have.

570
00:22:48,172 --> 00:22:51,103
I should have waited.
And here I go with

571
00:22:51,206 --> 00:22:54,241
my biggest Survivormistake
to date... saying a name.

572
00:22:54,344 --> 00:22:56,137
I made a mistake.

573
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:58,310
I swallow my words.

574
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,413
Do you guys have a name?

575
00:23:00,517 --> 00:23:02,379
- I don't have a name.
- Me neither.

576
00:23:06,206 --> 00:23:08,931
- Yam Yam.
- I just have a personal thing, you know?

577
00:23:09,034 --> 00:23:10,164
'Cause he was
against your number?

578
00:23:10,206 --> 00:23:11,551
Yeah.

579
00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:15,344
I'm down. He's not a number
for me, so, yeah.

580
00:23:15,448 --> 00:23:16,655
He's not a number for anybody.

581
00:23:16,758 --> 00:23:17,758
- All right.
- Yeah.

582
00:23:17,862 --> 00:23:19,000
JOSH: Right now,

583
00:23:19,103 --> 00:23:20,413
I don't have an idol

584
00:23:20,517 --> 00:23:22,103
so I want to get the target
on Yam Yam

585
00:23:22,206 --> 00:23:24,241
because Yam Yam and I don't have
a great history,

586
00:23:24,344 --> 00:23:26,000
I don't trust him.

587
00:23:26,103 --> 00:23:27,793
You know, he voted for me, so,

588
00:23:27,896 --> 00:23:29,216
I want to get him out
immediately.

589
00:23:31,206 --> 00:23:33,965
I just have a personal vendetta
against him, so, that's why

590
00:23:34,068 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm just like,
"Ugh! I can't trust him again."

591
00:23:36,103 --> 00:23:37,896
- Hey, I'm down.
- Me too.

592
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,310
We have to survive today.

593
00:23:39,413 --> 00:23:41,133
- You and I have to survive today.
- I know.

594
00:23:43,206 --> 00:23:44,758
I've heard that he does.

595
00:23:44,862 --> 00:23:46,413
- Me too.
- Yeah.

596
00:23:46,517 --> 00:23:48,482
- Wh-Which makes me wonder.
- Yeah.

597
00:23:48,586 --> 00:23:51,551
HEIDI: Right now,
the vote may be Yam Yam, but

598
00:23:51,655 --> 00:23:53,034
in all honesty, for my game,

599
00:23:53,137 --> 00:23:55,413
I think Josh going home is...
is the right thing.

600
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,758
He survived Soka,
he survived Tika,

601
00:23:57,862 --> 00:24:01,379
even though he was going to be
the next voted out.

602
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:04,103
But if he has an idol,
there may be a plan B, which

603
00:24:04,206 --> 00:24:07,310
could be Yam Yam, or maybe
it could change by tonight.

604
00:24:13,517 --> 00:24:16,000
[all whooping]

605
00:24:16,103 --> 00:24:17,543
- My God.
- [screaming] - Here we go.

606
00:24:17,586 --> 00:24:20,379
We made it to the merge feast!

607
00:24:22,034 --> 00:24:23,751
- ALL: Cheers!
- [whooping] - Congratulations.

608
00:24:23,793 --> 00:24:27,482
The stakes were really high
for the challenge.

609
00:24:27,586 --> 00:24:29,137
We were playing for immunity,

610
00:24:29,241 --> 00:24:32,034
and we were getting
the merge feast.

611
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,544
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, let's freaking eat.

612
00:24:33,586 --> 00:24:35,206
- Let's go!
- Yeah.

613
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,724
JAIME: And we did it.

614
00:24:36,827 --> 00:24:38,965
We hadn't eaten in 13 days.

615
00:24:39,068 --> 00:24:41,862
If you count worms
and some papaya,

616
00:24:41,965 --> 00:24:44,241
then great, but this was

617
00:24:44,344 --> 00:24:45,862
a true full-blown meal.

618
00:24:45,965 --> 00:24:47,620
- Wine?
- CAROLYN: Wine!

619
00:24:47,724 --> 00:24:49,241
[laughing]: Let's go, let's go.

620
00:24:49,344 --> 00:24:51,517
JAIME: The wand has been busy.

621
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,620
Win the challenge.

622
00:24:53,724 --> 00:24:55,103
Bling! Get your Buff back.

623
00:24:55,206 --> 00:24:57,379
Bling! Win immunity?

624
00:24:57,482 --> 00:25:00,068
Ring, ring, ring! [Laughs]
It's all happening.

625
00:25:00,172 --> 00:25:02,310
So who do you guys view...

626
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:06,000
...as the biggest threat out
of those six that are up there?

627
00:25:06,103 --> 00:25:08,310
MATT: I think Josh
is a pretty big threat

628
00:25:08,413 --> 00:25:09,958
- for sure, yeah.
- FRANNIE: He is a very

629
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,137
- adept social player.
- MATT: Yeah.

630
00:25:12,241 --> 00:25:14,931
If he has an idol,
he's playing it tonight.

631
00:25:15,034 --> 00:25:16,674
So there has to be a vote
on someone else.

632
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,544
BRANDON: A lot of
people want to vote for Josh.

633
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:20,206
The only issue is

634
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,689
he told me that he has an idol.

635
00:25:21,793 --> 00:25:23,206
I mean, he's told other people

636
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,030
that he doesn't have an idol,
so in the case

637
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:27,689
that he does have an idol,
we need to have a plan B.

638
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:29,371
- So who would be plan B then?
- [rolling thunder]

639
00:25:29,413 --> 00:25:31,344
Does anyone feel close to Kane?

640
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:33,103
I wasclose with him,
but I just...

641
00:25:33,206 --> 00:25:35,095
You know how you can just tell
when somebody looks at you?

642
00:25:35,137 --> 00:25:36,475
'Cause the way
he looks at me sometimes,

643
00:25:36,517 --> 00:25:38,103
I'm like, "I just know that..."

644
00:25:38,206 --> 00:25:39,544
- Something else is going on there.
- I'm so serious, though.

645
00:25:39,586 --> 00:25:41,310
Kane voted for me
at the first Tribal,

646
00:25:41,413 --> 00:25:42,475
and he's tried to,
you know, apologize

647
00:25:42,517 --> 00:25:43,931
to me and stuff like that.

648
00:25:44,034 --> 00:25:46,275
But I forgive,
but I don't forget, and I know

649
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:47,716
that he's somebody who is gonna
come for me again.

650
00:25:47,758 --> 00:25:49,034
It's just a matter of when.

651
00:25:49,137 --> 00:25:51,551
We also need to be careful
about who we tell.

652
00:25:51,655 --> 00:25:52,992
'Cause we don't want Josh
to play his idol,

653
00:25:53,034 --> 00:25:54,551
- you know?
- MATT: Right.

654
00:25:54,655 --> 00:25:56,544
- He doesn't have one. He does not have one.
- Yeah.

655
00:25:56,586 --> 00:25:58,682
CAROLYN: He showed me
the one he got from the journey.

656
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,275
He used that already.

657
00:26:00,379 --> 00:26:01,862
Then he tried to say

658
00:26:01,965 --> 00:26:04,965
that he had another idol,
so he whipped it out.

659
00:26:05,068 --> 00:26:06,344
And then Yam Yam goes,

660
00:26:06,448 --> 00:26:08,164
"You took that
from tree mail this morning."

661
00:26:08,206 --> 00:26:09,992
- Yeah.
- CAROLYN: Now, knowing that information, does anybody

662
00:26:10,034 --> 00:26:11,482
here think
he actually has an idol?

663
00:26:13,103 --> 00:26:14,448
No.

664
00:26:14,551 --> 00:26:15,965
FRANNIE:
So I think we have to plan

665
00:26:16,068 --> 00:26:18,034
- just in case as if he does.
- Yeah. Right.

666
00:26:18,137 --> 00:26:21,724
CAROLYN:
The people at the merge feast

667
00:26:21,827 --> 00:26:23,724
are all worried about an idol,
and I know

668
00:26:23,827 --> 00:26:26,551
Josh does not have an idol.

669
00:26:26,655 --> 00:26:29,275
I tell them the story
of the fake idol.

670
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,103
I tell them how he stole it
from tree mail,

671
00:26:31,206 --> 00:26:34,655
and they still
wouldn't believe me.

672
00:26:34,758 --> 00:26:37,827
Maybe Josh leaves fake,
takes real,

673
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:39,206
but leaves the paper

674
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,724
that says "This is a real
hidden immunity idol."

675
00:26:43,655 --> 00:26:45,103
What the ...?!

676
00:26:46,206 --> 00:26:48,275
They still are questioning it.

677
00:26:48,379 --> 00:26:50,068
I'm done.

678
00:26:50,172 --> 00:26:52,551
You guys, I cannot believe
we're here right now.

JAIME: At the merge meal, we...

689
00:27:33,275 --> 00:27:36,103
all came up with the vote
tonight being Josh.

690
00:27:36,206 --> 00:27:37,517
So,

691
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,310
it sounds like
we have an easy Tribal Council.

692
00:27:41,413 --> 00:27:42,716
However,
that's not always the case,

693
00:27:42,758 --> 00:27:44,586
Knowing the game of Survivor.

694
00:27:44,689 --> 00:27:47,758
Tell us, did any names come up,
any of our names?

695
00:27:47,862 --> 00:27:50,172
- Is everyone... gone?
- Yes.

696
00:27:50,275 --> 00:27:54,448
JAIME: So right now, we
are pretty unanimous on.

697
00:27:54,551 --> 00:27:57,275
- Josh being the biggest threat.
- Okay.

698
00:27:57,379 --> 00:27:59,724
But the only thing is, I don't
know if any of you guys know

699
00:27:59,827 --> 00:28:01,896
if he has an idol.

700
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,965
Because Josh might have an idol,
people threw Kane's name

701
00:28:06,068 --> 00:28:09,413
as a plan B so, we have a couple
of votes going on Kane.

702
00:28:09,517 --> 00:28:11,551
But hopefully,
our number-one plan works.

703
00:28:13,862 --> 00:28:15,896
...while we were eating.

704
00:28:23,379 --> 00:28:24,620
Okay.

705
00:28:24,724 --> 00:28:26,206
JOSH:
My first thought was, "Okay",

706
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,820
Yam Yam's the vote,"
but Frannie came to me

707
00:28:27,862 --> 00:28:29,413
and said, "It seems that Kane

708
00:28:29,517 --> 00:28:31,517
was the primary vote
that they were going for."

709
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,544
And I said, "Fine, I'm fine
with that. That's great."

710
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,448
So this puts in my mind,
then, I need

711
00:28:35,551 --> 00:28:37,758
to squash everything
with Yam Yam

712
00:28:37,862 --> 00:28:39,000
and make this work.

713
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,862
Instead of everyone
separating you and me.

714
00:28:45,965 --> 00:28:48,137
Ah.

715
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:53,517
JOSH: It makes sense for us
both to put Kane's name down

716
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,647
because we know each other,
we don't really know Kane.

717
00:28:55,689 --> 00:28:58,344
And I think I can save
my personal vendetta

718
00:28:58,448 --> 00:29:00,379
against Yam Yam for another day.

719
00:29:00,482 --> 00:29:03,793
I just want to look into
your face and... We're good.

720
00:29:03,896 --> 00:29:05,689
I thought
you were gonna kiss me.

721
00:29:05,793 --> 00:29:07,413
I was like,
"Not here. I'm married."

722
00:29:07,517 --> 00:29:09,379
Can we do
the double-crossing hand?

723
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:11,275
Girl.

724
00:29:11,379 --> 00:29:13,827
YAM YAM: Josh, the person
I'm trying to take out, he said,

725
00:29:13,931 --> 00:29:16,724
Kane as a vote,
which is a great idea.

726
00:29:16,827 --> 00:29:18,655
You know, but I like Kane.

727
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:21,931
I don't want
to write Kane's name down.

728
00:29:22,034 --> 00:29:23,655
I want to write Josh's name down

729
00:29:23,758 --> 00:29:26,413
and look at him and say,
"Bye, baby." You know?

730
00:29:27,448 --> 00:29:29,724
I want that gratification.

731
00:29:29,827 --> 00:29:31,586
Are you gonna play your idol?

732
00:29:31,689 --> 00:29:34,034
I probably have to. I mean, yes.

733
00:29:34,137 --> 00:29:35,655
Give it to me.

734
00:29:35,758 --> 00:29:37,068
Why would I give... Girl...

735
00:29:37,172 --> 00:29:39,379
- 'Cause we're making friends.
- Girl, no.

736
00:29:39,482 --> 00:29:40,962
YAM YAM:
But it's better Kane than me.

737
00:29:41,034 --> 00:29:44,482
So, do I have any hope
of working with Josh?

738
00:29:44,586 --> 00:29:46,172
I'm not gonna rule it out,

739
00:29:46,275 --> 00:29:48,724
but it's gonna
be my last option.

740
00:29:52,275 --> 00:29:54,000
Yeah.

741
00:29:54,103 --> 00:29:55,302
BRANDON: Part of me hopes
that Josh does go home,

742
00:29:55,344 --> 00:29:56,862
but then, part of me hopes

743
00:29:56,965 --> 00:29:59,310
that he doesn't, and then,
Kane goes home 'cause I really

744
00:29:59,413 --> 00:30:00,586
don't trust Kane.

745
00:30:02,965 --> 00:30:05,206
- He's played...
- He freaks out anyway.

746
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,758
BRANDON: But what could go wrong

747
00:30:06,862 --> 00:30:09,275
with this plan is
that Kane somehow finds out

748
00:30:09,379 --> 00:30:11,206
that he's a name.

749
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,830
That's the scary part.
You know, we all

750
00:30:12,931 --> 00:30:16,413
seem so on the same page,
but it only takes one person

751
00:30:16,517 --> 00:30:19,758
to go tell the wrong person
some information,

752
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:21,551
and everything could change.

753
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:23,068
How are you feeling?

754
00:30:23,172 --> 00:30:26,482
Well, like, a little bit
nervous because my...

755
00:30:26,586 --> 00:30:29,275
Like, my ass is
technically on the line.

756
00:30:29,379 --> 00:30:31,371
But, like, did you hear anything
at the picnic or anything?

757
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:32,793
Soka was pitching you.

758
00:30:32,896 --> 00:30:35,965
But everyone ended up
going to Josh.

759
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:38,241
I'm just worried Josh is, like,
gonna play an idol.

760
00:30:38,344 --> 00:30:39,758
Then I don't know
what will happen.

761
00:30:39,862 --> 00:30:42,827
I disclosed Kane's name
being brought up because

762
00:30:42,931 --> 00:30:45,551
I legitimately feel like
I connect with Kane.

763
00:30:45,655 --> 00:30:47,586
On Ratu, Kane and I bonded

764
00:30:47,689 --> 00:30:49,620
because he's a nerd
and I'm a nerd, and

765
00:30:49,724 --> 00:30:51,172
I kind of did want
to work with him.

766
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,344
Okay.

767
00:30:56,448 --> 00:30:58,793
My name is swirling.
That's a concerning thing.

768
00:30:58,896 --> 00:31:00,448
I don't want my name out there

769
00:31:00,551 --> 00:31:02,448
just so Josh doesn't play
his idol.

770
00:31:02,551 --> 00:31:05,206
Yam Yam seems like a perfectly
fine name to get out there.

771
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,390
I don't understand why
we had to mix my name into it.

772
00:31:09,793 --> 00:31:11,689
I'm going for Yam.

773
00:31:11,793 --> 00:31:15,068
So I'm trying to get people
to vote Yam Yam instead of Josh

774
00:31:15,172 --> 00:31:18,965
because if Josh plays an idol,
whoever he votes for goes,

775
00:31:19,068 --> 00:31:21,000
and I certainly don't want it
to be me.

776
00:31:21,103 --> 00:31:22,413
But Josh wanted Yam Yam.

777
00:31:22,517 --> 00:31:24,068
Yeah.

778
00:31:24,172 --> 00:31:26,000
KANE: Yam Yam is
a more chaotic player,

779
00:31:26,103 --> 00:31:28,689
so let's just get rid
of Yam Yam so that

780
00:31:28,793 --> 00:31:31,241
I'm still safe because I don't
know who all is gunning for me.

781
00:31:31,344 --> 00:31:32,482
I don't know these people.

782
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:35,000
So thank God I talked to Carson.

783
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:36,423
Yeah, that was a bad move,
Carson.

784
00:31:36,482 --> 00:31:39,310
- Why...?
- I did... He-he...

785
00:31:39,413 --> 00:31:41,448
- I know he is su... I think...
- First,

786
00:31:41,551 --> 00:31:43,620
he asked me. He's like,
"Did my name come to mind?"

787
00:31:43,724 --> 00:31:46,931
- I'm so sorry.
- This is gonna shake things up a lot.

788
00:31:47,034 --> 00:31:50,172
So, I think Josh has
a real idol, which is scary.

789
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,675
KANE:
Will you vote for Yam tonight?

790
00:31:51,758 --> 00:31:53,310
Yeah, Yam Yam goes home.

791
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:55,586
- Yeah, I can do that. I'll do that for sure.
- Yeah.

MATT: Kane wants
to switch the vote to Yam Yam,

793
00:31:58,172 --> 00:32:01,482
and as of this moment,
I am interested

794
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:06,137
in having a very large majority
because I do not have a vote,

795
00:32:06,241 --> 00:32:09,965
and I think that Yam Yam
is a pretty easy vote

796
00:32:10,068 --> 00:32:12,931
for most of the people
still in this game.

797
00:32:14,413 --> 00:32:15,965
Yeah.

798
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:17,862
Mm-hmm.

799
00:32:17,965 --> 00:32:19,724
Yeah, I think so, too.

800
00:32:19,827 --> 00:32:21,965
MATT: Yam Yam doesn't
have super strong relationships

801
00:32:22,068 --> 00:32:24,517
with almost anyone
in this game right now.

802
00:32:30,275 --> 00:32:32,931
MATT: But even back in Soka,
we were trying to get rid of Josh,

803
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,517
because nobody trusted him.

804
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,896
And if he escapes
at tonight's Tribal Council,

805
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,620
he is like Superman, you know,
bullets bouncing off his chest.

806
00:32:40,724 --> 00:32:42,689
If Josh has an idol,
he's playing it tonight.

807
00:32:43,724 --> 00:32:46,862
It's all a gamble.
You know, you have to make

808
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,379
these calculated risks.

809
00:32:48,482 --> 00:32:51,000
- I don't know what is going on here.
- Mm-hmm.

810
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:53,827
Yeah, like, my eyes are gonna
jump out of my... face.

[Lauren laughs]

812
00:32:56,172 --> 00:32:59,034

many variables in this game.

Everyone on the same beach

814
00:33:01,137 --> 00:33:02,793
is honestly overwhelming.

815
00:33:02,896 --> 00:33:04,130
Yam Yam's nervous,
Kane's nervous.

816
00:33:04,172 --> 00:33:06,310
I don't know
what's about to happen.

817
00:33:06,413 --> 00:33:07,751
I'm getting confused.
I-I have no...

818
00:33:07,793 --> 00:33:09,379
Legit, things have changed.

819
00:33:09,482 --> 00:33:11,310
I... No idea.

820
00:33:11,413 --> 00:33:13,613
MATT: There's so many people,
there's so many personalities,

821
00:33:13,655 --> 00:33:16,551
there's so many different bonds.

822
00:33:16,655 --> 00:33:20,862
The matrix of relationships is

823
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:23,551
exponentially more complex
in a group of 12.

824
00:33:23,655 --> 00:33:25,379
So, my mind is spinning.

825
00:33:25,482 --> 00:33:29,000
So far, we have been playing
Survivor.

826
00:33:29,103 --> 00:33:31,551

830
00:33:57,655 --> 00:33:59,103
Carson, before we get into

831
00:33:59,206 --> 00:34:00,931
the nitty-gritty
of tonight's Tribal,

832
00:34:01,034 --> 00:34:02,862
what's the biggest difference

833
00:34:02,965 --> 00:34:05,517
having so many people living
together? Even looking tonight,

834
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,206
we haven't had a Tribal
with everybody here until now.

835
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:11,655
Yeah. I feel like
on your individual tribes,

836
00:34:11,757 --> 00:34:13,965
you're able to kind of
keep track of what's going on.

837
00:34:14,068 --> 00:34:17,688
But when we're all on one beach,
it's chaotic.

838
00:34:17,793 --> 00:34:20,000
You can't keep track
of what anyone's saying.

839
00:34:20,103 --> 00:34:23,655
So you almost have to rely
on the people you trust more

840
00:34:23,757 --> 00:34:26,482
because you don't know
what conversations they've had

841
00:34:26,585 --> 00:34:28,275
and what they could be
saying about you.

842
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:30,275
PROBST: Kane, how
did you approach today?

843
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:32,516
Because there's so many
different things happening.

844
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,068
You have
everybody living together,

845
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,896
but you also have only half

846
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,241
of the people
that are in trouble tonight

847
00:34:38,344 --> 00:34:39,854
- and could be voted out.
- KANE: Carson put it right.

848
00:34:39,896 --> 00:34:43,068
We need to operate from a place
of belief and trust.

849
00:34:43,172 --> 00:34:45,000
So I met some of these folks
one day ago,

850
00:34:45,103 --> 00:34:47,068
so I don't really know
what they're all about.

851
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:49,172
And I met some
of these people 13 days ago,

852
00:34:49,275 --> 00:34:50,820
and I still don't really know
what they're all about.

853
00:34:50,862 --> 00:34:54,931
So, uh, I think that it's
really about the information

854
00:34:55,034 --> 00:34:56,578
that comes back to me,
whether it's true,

855
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,958
whether it's false, if it's
from the people that I trust,

856
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,344
that is my truth tonight.

857
00:35:00,448 --> 00:35:03,931
PROBST: Yam Yam, how do you
feel given that Tika got so small...

858
00:35:04,034 --> 00:35:06,689
You, Josh, and Carolyn...
So you don't have a lot

859
00:35:06,793 --> 00:35:08,655
of numbers coming into this?

860
00:35:08,758 --> 00:35:10,854
YAM YAM: We're coming
into this tribe at a disadvantage,

861
00:35:10,896 --> 00:35:14,034
and me and my big mouth
might be an even easier target.

862
00:35:14,137 --> 00:35:15,965
- So...
- PROBST: Is that real?

863
00:35:16,068 --> 00:35:18,758
Do you feel like you talk
too much or say the wrong thing?

864
00:35:18,862 --> 00:35:22,379
It's a thing that happens
in my normal life, you know?

865
00:35:22,482 --> 00:35:24,103
I just can't hold it in.

866
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:26,862
I can see the faces when I speak
more than I have to speak,

867
00:35:26,965 --> 00:35:30,034
but I just can't stop. You know,
I mean, it keeps coming out.

868
00:35:30,137 --> 00:35:32,034
Now I can't stop, either.

869
00:35:32,137 --> 00:35:33,682
You keep looking at me.
I think you want more.

870
00:35:33,724 --> 00:35:35,137
You want more? I don't know.

871
00:35:35,241 --> 00:35:37,620
[laughter]

872
00:35:37,724 --> 00:35:39,371
PROBST: Josh, you're
a part of this Tika three.

873
00:35:39,413 --> 00:35:43,275
Yeah, so, I come
from a little bit of a unique

874
00:35:43,379 --> 00:35:46,689
kind of background because
I did have a tribe before Soka

875
00:35:46,793 --> 00:35:49,241
that I started
establishing relationships

876
00:35:49,344 --> 00:35:51,275
and conversations with
in the beginning.

877
00:35:51,379 --> 00:35:53,517
And then, when we came back
together, that allowed me

878
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:57,034
the opportunity to reconnect,
so for me, it was a benefit.

879
00:35:57,137 --> 00:36:01,137
Brandon, how much talk was there
amongst the group

880
00:36:01,241 --> 00:36:02,931
about who might have idols?

881
00:36:03,034 --> 00:36:05,344
Speculation,
stories heard on journeys?

882
00:36:05,448 --> 00:36:07,689
Yes, there was absolutely a lot
of talk about idols.

883
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:10,413
You know, who might have them,
who might not have them, are...

884
00:36:10,517 --> 00:36:11,957
Is it a fake idol?
Is it a real idol?

885
00:36:12,034 --> 00:36:13,931
Like, there was a lot
of talk about idols today.

886
00:36:14,034 --> 00:36:16,482
PROBST: So, Carolyn,
what do you do when

887
00:36:16,586 --> 00:36:18,586
you're cross-checking
all of that in your head

888
00:36:18,689 --> 00:36:20,406
- to keep it straight?
- There has been so much

889
00:36:20,448 --> 00:36:22,164
information going around,
the fear of idols,

890
00:36:22,206 --> 00:36:25,413
all of this speculation
about fake idols,

891
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:28,206
and the cage, and we just...

892
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,950
Getting together,
especially at the feast,

893
00:36:30,034 --> 00:36:32,586
and hearing
so many different stories,

894
00:36:32,689 --> 00:36:34,034
it's so much information.

895
00:36:34,137 --> 00:36:36,000
I'm used to talking
to two other people.

896
00:36:36,103 --> 00:36:38,000
This is insanity.

897
00:36:38,103 --> 00:36:41,379
PROBST: So, Heidi, is the
concern always that I'm being

898
00:36:41,482 --> 00:36:44,655
told to vote this way,
but what might be happening is

899
00:36:44,758 --> 00:36:46,827
I'm the only one
that's gonna vote that way,

900
00:36:46,931 --> 00:36:48,827
and I'm not in on the vote?

901
00:36:48,931 --> 00:36:50,620
HEIDI: Yeah, it's very scary.

902
00:36:50,724 --> 00:36:53,413
It's like I'm driving the car.
I pick one person,

903
00:36:53,517 --> 00:36:55,793
they tell me a story A
and plan A.

904
00:36:55,896 --> 00:36:59,724
I drop them, I pick up
person B. They tell me story B

905
00:36:59,827 --> 00:37:02,103
and plan B. And then it's like,
"Okay, A or B?"

906
00:37:02,206 --> 00:37:05,034
I pick up C,
and they-they have plan C.

907
00:37:05,137 --> 00:37:06,586
So it was
all over the place today.

908
00:37:06,689 --> 00:37:09,793
Yam Yam, when you're watching
Survivorat home,

909
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:11,655
- you have all the information.
- Yeah.

910
00:37:11,758 --> 00:37:13,275
But when
you're sitting here tonight,

911
00:37:13,379 --> 00:37:15,034
and you don't have
all the information,

912
00:37:15,137 --> 00:37:17,517
it really is
a terrifying thought.

913
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:22,413
Every player is worried
at Tribal because they don't

914
00:37:22,517 --> 00:37:25,344
- have all the information.
- YAM YAM: There hasn't been

915
00:37:25,448 --> 00:37:27,862
a Tribal Council I haven't
been worried, like, for real.

916
00:37:27,965 --> 00:37:29,689
I'm really scared right now,
and I think

917
00:37:29,793 --> 00:37:31,862
the six of us
are feeling the same thing.

918
00:37:31,965 --> 00:37:34,275
Like, none of us are sure.

919
00:37:35,275 --> 00:37:37,655
Can we go back to the beach
and not do this tonight?

920
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:39,379
- You know what I'm saying?
- [laughter]

921
00:37:39,482 --> 00:37:43,551
And just, like, keep this and
we vote two people next Tribal?

922
00:37:43,655 --> 00:37:47,241
Like, I will not eat for two
weeks if you let that happen.

923
00:37:47,344 --> 00:37:49,655
[laughter]

924
00:37:49,758 --> 00:37:51,137
Matt, it is a rare opportunity

925
00:37:51,241 --> 00:37:54,310
to try to utilize
a little leverage

926
00:37:54,413 --> 00:37:56,137
and get just a little bit
of a foothold

927
00:37:56,241 --> 00:37:58,000
ahead of these other six

928
00:37:58,103 --> 00:37:59,724
who don't have
the same leverage.

929
00:37:59,827 --> 00:38:02,103
MATT: But at the same
time, it's overwhelming.

930
00:38:02,206 --> 00:38:06,551
I-I think we all feel that
the game has turned a corner.

931
00:38:06,655 --> 00:38:08,310
You know, like, in our tribes,

932
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:10,137
we're kind of going down
the bunny slopes,

933
00:38:10,241 --> 00:38:11,854
and then, we've turned a corner,
and suddenly,

934
00:38:11,896 --> 00:38:14,931
it's double black diamond,
and we're flying down.

935
00:38:15,034 --> 00:38:17,068
And then, a confetti cannon
goes... [whooshing]

936
00:38:17,172 --> 00:38:20,034
And there's a picture
that you have to put together

00:38:20,137 --> 00:38:22,233

as you're going down the hill.

938
00:38:22,275 --> 00:38:24,620
And then, you have to vote
based on this picture.
