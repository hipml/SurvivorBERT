1
00:00:06,586 --> 00:00:09,000
AUSTIN:
Dee and I-- we've become
so close during this.

2
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:13,172
We don't even have to say it.

3
00:00:13,275 --> 00:00:15,206
We know we have each other's
back through everything.

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,034
PROBST:
Previously on Survivor...

5
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,482
- You do?
- DREW: I'm ready to 
take some shots,

6
00:00:21,586 --> 00:00:24,862
but we have to keep 
Dee out of the loop.

7
00:00:29,034 --> 00:00:31,310
DEE:
Austin is trusting me, but 
Julie's my other number one.

8
00:00:31,413 --> 00:00:33,413
If I choose to vote Julie out,

9
00:00:33,517 --> 00:00:34,793
then my game is blown.

10
00:00:41,793 --> 00:00:43,862
- Okay. Got you.
- Okay?

11
00:00:43,965 --> 00:00:46,034
If anybody has an advantage
or an idol

12
00:00:46,137 --> 00:00:47,931
- and you want to play it...
- Jeff?

13
00:00:50,655 --> 00:00:52,103
I want to play it for myself.

14
00:00:52,206 --> 00:00:54,931
Julie.
Does not count.

15
00:00:55,034 --> 00:00:57,517
Julie. Does not count.

16
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,620
Julie. Does not count.

17
00:01:01,344 --> 00:01:02,551
PROBST:
Twelfth person voted out

18
00:01:02,655 --> 00:01:05,241
and the fifth member
of our jury:

19
00:01:05,343 --> 00:01:06,551
Emily.

20
00:01:10,482 --> 00:01:11,827
The tribe has spoken.

21
00:01:48,517 --> 00:01:51,241
- DREW: The fire's still going.
- KATURAH: That was a great 
save, Mama J.

22
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,068
- That was...
- Julie packing heat.

23
00:01:53,172 --> 00:01:55,827
That was a fantastic play.

24
00:01:56,862 --> 00:01:58,551
JULIE:
What a crazy night.

25
00:01:58,655 --> 00:02:01,931
They all turned on me,
but I played an idol

26
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:04,413
that Austin gave to me.
I'm safe.

27
00:02:04,517 --> 00:02:05,551
Emily went home.

28
00:02:08,413 --> 00:02:09,723
I don't blame you guys.

29
00:02:09,827 --> 00:02:11,655
I know you're just 
playing a game.

30
00:02:11,758 --> 00:02:13,448
Dee's the one that 
told me everybody

31
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:14,896
was gonna blindside me,

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,275
but we want to keep that cover

33
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:18,793
that Dee and I are 
working together.

34
00:02:18,896 --> 00:02:21,793
So in order to hide that,

35
00:02:21,896 --> 00:02:24,172
we're acting totally pissed
at each other, but in reality,

36
00:02:24,275 --> 00:02:27,379
we still got to keep 
that friggin' alliance.

37
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:28,965
So that's kind of exciting.

38
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:37,448
AUSTIN:
Tonight was an 
absolute disaster.

39
00:02:37,551 --> 00:02:40,137
This is the one thing that 
we did not want to happen.

40
00:02:40,241 --> 00:02:43,620
But even though
Julie played her idol,

41
00:02:43,724 --> 00:02:45,067
I thought Julie would either

42
00:02:45,172 --> 00:02:46,930
vote for Jake or for Emily.
So I kept

43
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,413
holding on to my amulet
instead of playing it,

44
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:50,965
and I'm glad that I did.

45
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:53,482
Because my amulet that 
I have is a full idol,

46
00:02:53,586 --> 00:02:56,310
but it's only good until 
the final six Tribal,

47
00:02:56,413 --> 00:02:59,034
meaning this next Tribal
Council, I need to play it.

48
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:02,137
So this amulet is very 
important right now.

49
00:03:02,241 --> 00:03:06,034
Plus, everyone's eyes
are focused on Julie.

50
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:14,310
DEE:
I basically had to act
when Julie played her idol.

51
00:03:14,413 --> 00:03:16,655
I had to be so surprised
and look at everyone

52
00:03:16,758 --> 00:03:18,000
like...

53
00:03:18,103 --> 00:03:19,931
Even though I knew 
what was gonna happen

54
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:22,310
because I told her what to do.

55
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,034
I had to automatically become
awkward in front of everyone.

56
00:03:28,137 --> 00:03:29,689
I got to be the best actress

57
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,448
that I've been
in my entire life.

58
00:03:31,551 --> 00:03:32,655
It's a game. We're almost done.

59
00:03:32,758 --> 00:03:34,482
We can act for a few more days.

60
00:03:40,413 --> 00:03:42,689
It was so nerve-wracking
because I knew that there was

61
00:03:42,793 --> 00:03:45,379
a possibility that they thought
I told her. So I have to

62
00:03:45,482 --> 00:03:48,551
pretend now that 
I am in trouble,

63
00:03:48,655 --> 00:03:49,896
because I wrote 
Julie's name down.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,482
She's gonna come after me.

65
00:03:51,586 --> 00:03:53,067
She's not gonna come after you.

66
00:03:53,172 --> 00:03:56,930
I think this is actually the
best-case scenario for our game.

67
00:03:57,034 --> 00:03:58,551
- Everyone's trying
to get rid of Julie...
- You're right.

68
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,413
And then Emily... and Emily...

69
00:04:01,551 --> 00:04:04,344
- Yeah. Emily and Drew
separate is a good thing.
- Exactly.

70
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,586
Yeah, obviously. Who?

71
00:04:14,103 --> 00:04:16,310
I don't know, because they 
know how close you all are.

72
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,620
- DREW: Can I join?
- DEE: Yeah, you can sit.

73
00:04:19,724 --> 00:04:21,620
- DEE: Have you talked to Julie?
- DREW: No.

74
00:04:21,724 --> 00:04:23,275
- She's gonna come for me.
- Julie?

75
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:25,103
- Yes.
- Did you tell her?

76
00:04:25,206 --> 00:04:27,103
- No, of course I 
didn't tell her.

77
00:04:27,206 --> 00:04:29,551
I think if this group
showed one thing,

78
00:04:29,655 --> 00:04:31,448
it's that we are not
gonna win an Oscar, you know?

79
00:04:31,551 --> 00:04:32,896
There are some bad actors
in this tribe.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,551
All we had to do
was just lie to Julie

81
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:37,965
for one vote, and we failed.

82
00:04:38,068 --> 00:04:41,413
- She's smart. She's a very 
good social player.
- She's not under...

83
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:43,689
...underestimated.

84
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,586
DEE:
I have no idea how I sold it.

85
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:49,758
I just pretended to be stupid.

86
00:04:49,862 --> 00:04:51,724
I don't think I'm a good
actress. That's the crazy thing.

87
00:04:51,827 --> 00:04:53,068
Like, in my day-to-day life,

88
00:04:53,172 --> 00:04:54,793
there's no point for 
me to lie to anybody.

89
00:04:54,896 --> 00:04:56,620
But out here, it's a game.

90
00:04:56,724 --> 00:04:58,103
It's almost just as important

91
00:04:58,206 --> 00:05:00,413
as finding an idol and 
keeping it to yourself,

92
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:02,068
at this point-- the acting.

93
00:05:02,172 --> 00:05:04,448
AUSTIN:
I actually think this 
is better for our game.

94
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:06,448
Everyone's eyes are 
gonna look onto Julie.

95
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:07,586
- DREW: Yeah.
- This keeps us safe.

96
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:09,000
So she has to go next.

97
00:05:09,103 --> 00:05:10,793
- DREW: She has to go next.
- Or the next.

98
00:05:10,896 --> 00:05:11,931
AUSTIN: We're safe.

99
00:05:12,034 --> 00:05:13,344
This is the final three.

100
00:05:13,448 --> 00:05:15,034
- Yeah, I think.
- Okay.

101
00:05:17,586 --> 00:05:19,931
- AUSTIN: Julie.
- You remember the good old days?

102
00:05:20,034 --> 00:05:21,344
- DREW: Oh, my God, Julie.

103
00:05:21,448 --> 00:05:23,310
- You remember the good old days?

104
00:05:23,413 --> 00:05:25,862
I don't know, Julie, do you
remember the good old days, man?

105
00:05:25,965 --> 00:05:27,413
- AUSTIN: Oh, my gosh.
- What's been going on?

106
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:29,517
Dee, Austin and myself
are sitting on the beach,

107
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,448
and Julie, like, throws 
herself on top of me.

108
00:05:31,551 --> 00:05:33,241
Like, "Remember when
we were the Reba four?"

109
00:05:33,344 --> 00:05:35,206
Like, "Get off me. Get off me."

110
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,000
Like, "I don't know...
We're not friends right now."

111
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:40,344
We all wanted Julie to go home,
but she didn't, you know?

112
00:05:40,448 --> 00:05:41,965
She's like the guest
who shows up

113
00:05:42,068 --> 00:05:44,310
uninvited at the party, like the
ex-girlfriend at the wedding.

114
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:45,827
I was for real.

115
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:48,241
- I was Reba four strong.
- AUSTIN: I said... Julie, okay.

116
00:05:48,344 --> 00:05:50,827
JULIE:
What does the Reba alliance
mean now?

117
00:05:50,931 --> 00:05:54,068
I just don't know if I could
trust the Reba four again.

118
00:05:54,172 --> 00:05:57,793
I mean, Drew pretty much
just blew it up.

119
00:05:57,896 --> 00:06:00,206
So it's game on.

120
00:07:14,896 --> 00:07:16,724
KATURAH: Last night,

121
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:18,551
Julie played an idol at Tribal,

122
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:20,344
and that blew up the vote.

123
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:24,344
I do know that once 
an idol is played,

124
00:07:24,448 --> 00:07:25,965
historically, in Survivor,

125
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:29,379
it's planted back on the 
island the very next day.

126
00:07:32,344 --> 00:07:35,689
Now, I haven't had the best luck
with finding idols.

127
00:07:35,793 --> 00:07:38,482
It's been 22 days.
I found literally nothing.

128
00:07:38,586 --> 00:07:40,034
I'm hoping that changes.

129
00:07:40,137 --> 00:07:41,379
I'm still gonna be looking,

130
00:07:41,482 --> 00:07:44,068
because I don't want 
Julie to find it.

131
00:07:57,965 --> 00:07:59,310
DEE:
This morning, I wake up,

132
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:00,931
and I count the people
that are in the bed.

133
00:08:01,034 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm like, "Who's here?"
Katurah wasn't in the bed.

134
00:08:04,103 --> 00:08:06,862
I'm like, "Girl, you 
don't wake up that early.

135
00:08:06,965 --> 00:08:08,620
You've never woken 
up that early."

136
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,896
And it's clear that she's 
up early idol hunting

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,551
because she's scared and she

138
00:08:14,655 --> 00:08:16,241
wants to find something.
So me and Austin

139
00:08:16,344 --> 00:08:18,551
look at each other.
We're like, "We got to go."

140
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,896
KATURAH:
I'm getting nervous as heck.

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,344
I 1,000% need to 
add to my résumé,

142
00:08:30,448 --> 00:08:31,862
because I'm afraid I might

143
00:08:31,965 --> 00:08:33,482
get to the final three
and I may not

144
00:08:33,586 --> 00:08:35,000
have as compelling of a speech.

145
00:08:36,861 --> 00:08:39,482
I want to win and I 
need to be able to show

146
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:41,482
that I've had an 
evolution in this game,

147
00:08:41,586 --> 00:08:43,586
that I haven't been
a passive player.

148
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:45,655
And finding an idol--
that would be huge.

149
00:08:47,586 --> 00:08:51,000
So I'm searching and digging
and looking on trees. What else

150
00:08:51,103 --> 00:08:52,931
can I do but try in this game?

151
00:08:53,034 --> 00:08:54,448
I have to give it my all.

152
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:11,965
Damn. You snuck 
right up on me. Hi.

153
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:13,551
Sorry.

154
00:09:15,344 --> 00:09:16,931
I look up and I see Austin.

155
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:19,482
And I'm like, "What are you
doing here?" Literally

156
00:09:19,586 --> 00:09:21,172
nobody goes down that path.

157
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:22,551
There's no trees down there.

158
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:25,275
- Good morning. How you doing?
- Nervous.

159
00:09:30,689 --> 00:09:32,862
Yeah. That-that is a good point.

160
00:09:35,137 --> 00:09:37,689
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

161
00:09:37,793 --> 00:09:39,413
AUSTIN:
We all know that another idol

162
00:09:39,517 --> 00:09:42,896
could very well be planted
somewhere on this island,

163
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,482
and I don't want anyone to
find it, especially not Julie.

164
00:09:54,172 --> 00:09:56,758
JULIE:
I did not sleep last night.

165
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:58,482
I just couldn't sleep.

166
00:09:58,586 --> 00:10:01,758
Last Tribal's vote showed that

167
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:05,137
this is not a "Kumbaya, let's
get to the end with friends."

168
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,620
JAKE:
Ooh!

169
00:10:07,724 --> 00:10:09,034
JULIE:
This is, "Who do I want

170
00:10:09,137 --> 00:10:11,379
to sit with?" and "I want 
to take out people

171
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,103
that I don't think
I can beat at the end."

172
00:10:13,206 --> 00:10:14,724
Do you want to have 
our talk in a little?

173
00:10:14,827 --> 00:10:16,275
- JULIE: Yes, I do.
- Okay, great.

174
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:17,758
- Whenever you're ready.
- JULIE: Yeah. Yeah, I'm ready.

175
00:10:17,862 --> 00:10:20,379
I think it'd be smart if the 
four Rebas were at the end,

176
00:10:20,482 --> 00:10:22,931
but I don't know if 
that's a possible thing.

177
00:10:23,034 --> 00:10:25,137
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

178
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:28,034
I think we're in agreement
who cannot win.

179
00:10:34,103 --> 00:10:38,551
So, when we said,
"100% final four Reba..."

180
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:42,448
- Yeah. I'm still, I'm 
still fine to go with Reba.
- ...I meant that 100%.

181
00:10:42,551 --> 00:10:45,275
Yeah. I-I think there are
still plenty of routes forward

182
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:49,068
for Reba, and, uh, most of them
start with, uh, voting out Jake.

183
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:50,655
- So...
- Yeah, see,

184
00:10:50,758 --> 00:10:52,862
- my insecurity is I don't 
want to be an idiot
- Yeah.

185
00:10:52,965 --> 00:10:55,413
- and y'all tell me that again.
- And getting it the second time?

186
00:10:55,517 --> 00:10:58,000
- Yeah, I mean...
- Like, I don't know
how to build this back.

187
00:10:58,103 --> 00:10:59,896
Like, I want to 100%,
because if I...

188
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,344
I think for both of our games...

189
00:11:04,137 --> 00:11:05,827
- ...there should be Reba there.
- Yeah.

190
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,931
After I stomach and 
I swallow the rage

191
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:11,172
of-of this-this blown-up plan,

192
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:13,137
my first play is to kind of,

193
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:14,896
you know, coddle Julie
and to say,

194
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,482
"No, there is a route forward.

195
00:11:16,586 --> 00:11:18,344
No, Reba needs 
to stick together."

196
00:11:18,448 --> 00:11:22,206
But realistically, she is on an
island alone. There really is

197
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,379
no getting around the fact that
Julie is a perennial outsider,

198
00:11:25,482 --> 00:11:27,448
like, now and for 
the rest of the game.

199
00:11:27,551 --> 00:11:29,448
I don't think the Reba four
is a dead and buried thing.

200
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:31,620
- I'd be more than happy to...
- I'd love to bring the 
band back together.

201
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:32,931
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

202
00:11:33,034 --> 00:11:35,068
We can go on a reunion 
tour after a break...

203
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:37,034
after a break...
a short breakup.

204
00:11:37,137 --> 00:11:38,793
- No, we-we didn't...
We-we weren't ready.
- Short difference of opinions.

205
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:40,793
We weren't ready for 
our solo careers yet.

206
00:11:40,896 --> 00:11:43,724
JULIE:
We're like, "Yeah, we're getting
the band back together," but

207
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:45,103
I just feel like it's...

208
00:11:46,103 --> 00:11:47,448
...lies.

209
00:11:47,551 --> 00:11:49,827
Band's getting back together
for a reunion tour.

210
00:11:49,931 --> 00:11:52,931
JULIE:
Drew organized this
entire blindside against me,

211
00:11:53,034 --> 00:11:55,241
and he now says he 
wants to work with me.

212
00:11:55,344 --> 00:11:57,551
I think he's just
feeding me what he thinks

213
00:11:57,655 --> 00:11:59,275
I want to hear or 
what I will believe.

214
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:01,827
So, at this point,
there's only one person

215
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:03,724
that I trust 100%.

216
00:12:07,965 --> 00:12:08,965
I don't think

217
00:12:09,068 --> 00:12:11,000
that people are onto the fact

218
00:12:11,103 --> 00:12:12,965
that Dee and I are 
as close as we are

219
00:12:13,068 --> 00:12:14,448
and are working together.

220
00:12:14,551 --> 00:12:15,965
But there's six people left,

221
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,724
and Dee's the only 
one that I trust.

222
00:12:17,827 --> 00:12:18,724
'Cause she's proved it.

223
00:12:18,827 --> 00:12:20,206
She saved my life.

224
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,103
So we need numbers.

225
00:12:27,793 --> 00:12:30,724
It's even harder to 
act back at camp.

226
00:12:30,827 --> 00:12:33,482
When you orchestrate
such a big blindside,

227
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,172
you cannot tell anybody,

228
00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:38,000
because the moment that
that comes out of my mouth--

229
00:12:38,103 --> 00:12:40,034
even if it's to Austin,
who's my other number one--

230
00:12:40,137 --> 00:12:42,206
I am risking a million dollars.

231
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,689
At one point, they came up me,
and they're like,

232
00:12:43,793 --> 00:12:44,965
"Did you tell her?"

233
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:46,793
And I was like,
"No, I did not tell her.

234
00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:48,206
- I swear on my mom."
- Right.

235
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,310
- I had to swear, like, on them.
- Yeah.

236
00:12:50,413 --> 00:12:52,241
- I know.
- Because Austin came up to me,

237
00:12:52,344 --> 00:12:55,000
- and he's like, "Dude,
people think you told her."
- Right.

238
00:12:55,103 --> 00:12:57,000
- So I had to swear 
on my parents.
- Yeah. Yeah.

239
00:12:57,103 --> 00:12:58,689
DEE:
Out here, I'm gonna
swear on everybody.

240
00:12:58,793 --> 00:13:00,172
I'm gonna swear on my dogs.

241
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:02,172
I'm gonna swear on 
my mom, on my dad,

242
00:13:02,275 --> 00:13:04,241
and they're gonna still be 
alive when I leave here,

243
00:13:04,344 --> 00:13:05,655
and they're gonna 
be happy when I win

244
00:13:05,758 --> 00:13:07,275
and that I swore for them.

245
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:10,517
You're my only in, because,
like, I swear Drew wants me out.

246
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,206
- Drew is the master...
Drew-Drew is...
- He is.

247
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,689
Drew is the one that had 
said your name before.

248
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:17,448
- I swear. I swear.
- I know.

249
00:13:17,551 --> 00:13:19,310
- Like, I know you mentioned
Austin, but...
- No, no, no.

250
00:13:19,413 --> 00:13:20,965
Austin's playing into Drew.

251
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:22,551
- He is. That's what I'm saying.
- Yeah. 'Cause they're close.

252
00:13:22,655 --> 00:13:24,689
- Austin will not write 
 Drew's name down.
- No, he won't.

253
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,896
- But Austin was the one 
that told me about you.
- Yeah.

254
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,413
Drew-- we all know
that he's a mastermind,

255
00:13:31,517 --> 00:13:32,793
and he's good at Tribal talking.

256
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,482
- You know what I mean?
- Yes. He's got to go.

257
00:13:34,586 --> 00:13:35,724
Yeah, he's got to go.

258
00:13:35,827 --> 00:13:37,068
JULIE:
I got to get Drew out.

259
00:13:38,137 --> 00:13:40,275
He wants me out, therefore 
I have to get him out.

260
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:42,103
What happened to Reba strong?

261
00:13:42,206 --> 00:13:45,206
What happened?
We were so good.

262
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,551
I'll tell you what happened.
Drew happened.

263
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,413
Come on in.

264
00:14:19,517 --> 00:14:21,448
And then there were six.

265
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:23,241
The faces of warriors.

266
00:14:23,344 --> 00:14:25,413
PROBST:
Today, I see some smiles

267
00:14:25,517 --> 00:14:28,344
and some very stern faces

268
00:14:28,448 --> 00:14:31,068
that are now turning 
into smiles.

269
00:14:32,517 --> 00:14:35,931
- All right, shall we get
to today's reward challenge?
- Yeah!

270
00:14:36,034 --> 00:14:37,758
PROBST:
All right, for today's challenge,

271
00:14:37,862 --> 00:14:40,137
you're gonna race 
in from the ocean

272
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:41,758
till you get to a barrel.

273
00:14:41,862 --> 00:14:46,137
You're gonna stand on the barrel
using ropes to guide you

274
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:48,724
through a course as you 
collect three keys.

275
00:14:48,827 --> 00:14:50,103
Once you have all three keys,

276
00:14:50,206 --> 00:14:52,655
you'll use them to 
unlock and then solve

277
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,000
a Survivor slide puzzle.

278
00:14:57,137 --> 00:14:59,517
First person to 
finish wins reward.

279
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,931
- Want to know what 
you're playing for?
- Hell, yeah!

280
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:05,275
- It's a perfect day
for a picnic.
- JAKE: I love those.

281
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,344
- JAKE: Yeah, baby.
- AUSTIN: Let's go.

282
00:15:09,448 --> 00:15:11,931
- JAKE: Let's go.
- PROBST: Everything you need

283
00:15:12,034 --> 00:15:15,448
for a beautiful
afternoon picnic.

284
00:15:15,551 --> 00:15:17,896
You could do this back at camp,

285
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,379
but today we're gonna
do something different.

286
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:21,827
You're gonna go somewhere
you have not been--

287
00:15:21,931 --> 00:15:25,448
a beautiful sandspit in 
the middle of the ocean.

288
00:15:26,862 --> 00:15:28,206
PROBST:
It's truly one of those places

289
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,862
where you're gonna look around

290
00:15:29,965 --> 00:15:32,206
and it's gonna be 
just you, the food ..

291
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,344
and the waves lapping 
against the sand.

292
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:39,137
And I'm looking at the ocean,
it's kind of rough,

293
00:15:39,241 --> 00:15:41,310
so let's get there
by helicopter.

294
00:15:42,827 --> 00:15:44,448
PROBST: Everything you need

295
00:15:44,551 --> 00:15:46,793
for a once-in-a-lifetime
experience.

296
00:15:46,896 --> 00:15:48,758
All you got to do is 
win this challenge.

297
00:15:48,862 --> 00:15:50,793
Worth playing for?

298
00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:52,862
All right, we're gonna draw
for spots. We'll get it on.

299
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:55,724
Let's do it. Here we go.

300
00:16:05,724 --> 00:16:07,724
KATURAH:
Like, why?

301
00:16:07,827 --> 00:16:10,620
Why? Oh, my God.

302
00:16:10,724 --> 00:16:13,413
PROBST:
Okay, here we go. For reward.

303
00:16:13,517 --> 00:16:15,137
Survivors ready?

304
00:16:17,758 --> 00:16:19,172
Go!

305
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:22,586
First, it is a race to get 
back here to that barrel.

306
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:25,655
You can walk it
or you can swim it.

307
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,344
Everybody racing back.
Austin gonna get here first.

308
00:16:32,448 --> 00:16:34,275
Here comes Drew and Jake.

309
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,310
Julie and Dee.

310
00:16:42,448 --> 00:16:43,724
Here comes Katurah.

311
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:46,965
Everybody now working 
on that second phase.

312
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:51,275
Now you got to get 
up on that barrel

313
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:54,931
and use these ropes to 
move across the course.

314
00:16:57,137 --> 00:16:59,655
You're trying to grab 
those three keys.

315
00:17:03,551 --> 00:17:05,137
It is Austin with his first key,

316
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:07,068
moving, now looking 
for that second.

317
00:17:07,172 --> 00:17:09,862
If you fall off,
you got to go back.

318
00:17:17,172 --> 00:17:18,619
Drew has his first key.

319
00:17:18,723 --> 00:17:21,000
Jake working on his first key.

320
00:17:23,827 --> 00:17:26,000
Drew trying to hang on.

321
00:17:27,448 --> 00:17:28,689
Nice recovery.

322
00:17:31,965 --> 00:17:34,206
Katurah's in this now.
There you go, Katurah.

323
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:40,379
Big reward on the line.

324
00:17:42,517 --> 00:17:45,034
Austin with his second key.

325
00:17:45,137 --> 00:17:47,931
Right now, it is Austin 
doing a nice job

326
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:50,275
using these ropes as a guide.

327
00:17:53,517 --> 00:17:55,413
Drew right on his tail.

328
00:17:56,448 --> 00:17:58,103
Here comes Jake.

329
00:18:01,827 --> 00:18:03,689
Dee struggling to hang on.

330
00:18:06,862 --> 00:18:08,551
Julie doing a nice job.

331
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:10,413
Katurah's in it.

332
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:12,793
You got to figure out
that balance point.

333
00:18:14,137 --> 00:18:17,413
Austin having no trouble
with this course at all.

334
00:18:17,517 --> 00:18:20,068
Austin, you're good.
Start working on that puzzle.

335
00:18:20,172 --> 00:18:22,862
You got three keys. One
of them will unlock the puzzle.

336
00:18:22,965 --> 00:18:24,310
You're good, Drew.

337
00:18:24,413 --> 00:18:27,206
Drew has all three keys.
He's in it now.

338
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,275
Jake working toward that second.

339
00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:31,275
He's got his second.

340
00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:33,689
Julie looking for 
that third key.

341
00:18:33,793 --> 00:18:36,620
Julie's got two.
Dee has her second.

342
00:18:38,724 --> 00:18:40,241
This is awesome.

343
00:18:40,344 --> 00:18:42,517
PROBST:
Katurah's got one.
Working on that second.

344
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,896
Everybody is in this right now.

345
00:18:47,206 --> 00:18:49,206
Austin has his unlocked.

346
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,241
Austin working on the puzzle.

347
00:18:51,344 --> 00:18:53,172
Drew has his unlocked.

348
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,241
Jake, you're good.

349
00:18:57,275 --> 00:18:59,137
Julie's good.
She's got her third key.

350
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:01,793
Julie's here.
Dee has her third key.

351
00:19:02,827 --> 00:19:04,310
Get to that mat, Dee,
and you're good.

352
00:19:04,413 --> 00:19:06,034
You're good, Dee.

353
00:19:07,068 --> 00:19:08,758
Slide puzzles can take forever

354
00:19:08,862 --> 00:19:11,137
or they can be solved 
very quickly.

355
00:19:12,275 --> 00:19:14,655
You slide pieces left
and right or up and down.

356
00:19:14,758 --> 00:19:17,448
- You'd love to just pick 
  one up, but you can't.
- KATURAH: Am I good?

357
00:19:17,551 --> 00:19:19,000
Katurah, you're good.

358
00:19:19,103 --> 00:19:21,965
Katurah has her third key.
Start unlocking that puzzle.

359
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:29,206
You've seen how long
a slide puzzle can take.

360
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:32,068
You've also seen how quickly 
they can come together.

361
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,551
You can feel like 
you're nowhere,

362
00:19:33,655 --> 00:19:35,931
and then, suddenly, three 
moves and you got it.

363
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,896
Austin got here first.

364
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,310
He's been working on it
the longest, then Drew.

365
00:19:44,413 --> 00:19:46,413
Will that time advantage help?

366
00:19:49,379 --> 00:19:51,793
When you think you 
have it, step back.

367
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,068
AUSTIN:
Jeff. Jeff.

368
00:20:00,172 --> 00:20:02,068
Austin thinks he has it,
and he does.

369
00:20:02,172 --> 00:20:06,034
Austin pulls it out
and wins reward on day 22

370
00:20:06,137 --> 00:20:08,344
-Amazing, man.
-of Survivor45.

371
00:20:08,448 --> 00:20:09,448
-Good job.
-Good job.

372
00:20:09,551 --> 00:20:11,172
PROBST:
Wow, that was fast.

373
00:20:11,275 --> 00:20:12,310
Austin led that challenge

374
00:20:12,413 --> 00:20:14,862
-from start to finish.
-Awesome.

375
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:17,000
-PROBST: Wow.
-Great job, man. Great job.

376
00:20:20,068 --> 00:20:22,689
All right, Austin, come on over.

377
00:20:22,793 --> 00:20:24,482
Right here.

378
00:20:27,137 --> 00:20:28,758
Big reward on day 22.

379
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:31,896
You're gonna leave here,
go to a beautiful place

380
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,758
in the middle of the ocean,
and have a lovely picnic.

381
00:20:34,862 --> 00:20:36,758
Choose one person to join you

382
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:41,448
-for this afternoon's
once-in-a-lifetime experience.
AUSTIN: Oh, my gosh.

383
00:20:41,551 --> 00:20:42,793
I-I have to pick Dee
on this one.

384
00:20:42,896 --> 00:20:44,344
PROBST:
Come on over, Dee.

385
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:50,896
All right, Austin,
you have one more spot.

386
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,172
-Oh, my God.
-PROBST: You have four people.

387
00:20:53,275 --> 00:20:54,689
Everybody clearly wants it.

388
00:20:54,793 --> 00:20:56,965
Walk me through,
before you tell me who,

389
00:20:57,068 --> 00:21:00,586
why are you choosing
the last person to join you?

390
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,379
AUSTIN:
It's obviously, at this point,

391
00:21:03,482 --> 00:21:05,965
a mix of both
personal and strategic.

392
00:21:06,068 --> 00:21:08,137
You got to make sure that
when you're gone, the people

393
00:21:08,241 --> 00:21:10,931
you send back are not gonna
be the ones who are gonna be,

394
00:21:11,034 --> 00:21:13,379
"All right, let's talk Austin.
Let's get him out now.

395
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:14,620
He didn't pick me."

396
00:21:14,724 --> 00:21:16,965
PROBST:
So that implies that the loyalty

397
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:19,137
or the alliance might
want you to choose one person,

398
00:21:19,241 --> 00:21:21,862
but you might need that person
to actually be back at camp

399
00:21:21,965 --> 00:21:24,862
to try to hold things together
or stop them from falling apart.

400
00:21:24,965 --> 00:21:27,034
-AUSTIN: Exactly.
-PROBST: Tricky.

401
00:21:28,068 --> 00:21:31,275
What's the decision?

402
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,586
Katurah.

403
00:21:34,689 --> 00:21:36,827
-PROBST: Katurah?
-Really? [chuckles] Wow.

404
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:40,586
-Shocked.
-I am always shocked.

405
00:21:40,689 --> 00:21:43,413
Thank you, Austin.
I appreciate that.

406
00:21:43,517 --> 00:21:45,448
All right, Austin,
here's what's gonna happen.

407
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:48,034
You, Dee, Katurah,
gonna leave here,

408
00:21:48,137 --> 00:21:49,724
be taken
to a beautiful sandspit.

409
00:21:49,827 --> 00:21:51,793
-Have you ever
been to a sandspit?
-Never.

410
00:21:51,896 --> 00:21:54,724
Should make for
a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

411
00:21:54,827 --> 00:21:56,758
Grab your stuff, head out.

412
00:21:56,862 --> 00:21:58,793
Helicopter will take you
to your destination.

413
00:21:58,896 --> 00:22:00,517
Oh, my God.

414
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,896
-DEE: Grab this?
-KATURAH: I'll grab...

415
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,482
PROBST:
Take it all.

416
00:22:03,586 --> 00:22:04,689
-This one.
-Yeah.

417
00:22:04,793 --> 00:22:07,517
PROBST:
And enjoy. Well-earned.

418
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,034
-JAKE: Have fun, guys.
-JULIE: Y'all, have fun.

419
00:22:09,137 --> 00:22:11,448
KATURAH:
Thanks, guys. Sorry, y'all.

420
00:22:12,482 --> 00:22:14,551
DEE:
Oh, my God.

421
00:22:14,655 --> 00:22:16,724
KATURAH [laughs]:
Oh, my God.

422
00:22:16,827 --> 00:22:18,896
-Oh, my God. An actual...
-[sighs]

423
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,551
Drew, what was that sigh for?

424
00:22:20,655 --> 00:22:22,103
DREW:
I don't know, man.

425
00:22:22,206 --> 00:22:23,172
Like, you know,
I'm used to being, like,

426
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:24,517
the last schoolyard pick

427
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,068
growing up,
and, like, the only time

428
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:28,241
I've ever been on a reward
is when I won it, you know?

429
00:22:28,344 --> 00:22:30,379
And so I had to come. Nobody's
ever picked me, you know?

430
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,689
I'm the only person out here who
never gets picked on a reward.

431
00:22:32,793 --> 00:22:35,241
You know? I know
there are reasons for it,

432
00:22:35,344 --> 00:22:37,034
but there were reasons for it
in middle school, too,

433
00:22:37,137 --> 00:22:38,586
and it-it sucks.

434
00:22:38,689 --> 00:22:41,724
And, Julie, even though
they've anointed you the mom,

435
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,827
it doesn't mean
you don't have your own things

436
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:46,310
that go through your mind,
as a person who also

437
00:22:46,413 --> 00:22:48,310
wanted to go on that reward,
I'm sure.

438
00:22:48,413 --> 00:22:49,689
Well, absolutely.

439
00:22:49,793 --> 00:22:51,862
And especially since
it was a unanimous vote

440
00:22:51,965 --> 00:22:54,413
to kick me out last Tribal...

441
00:22:54,517 --> 00:22:56,620
I feel like I'm getting
babysit back at camp.

442
00:22:56,724 --> 00:22:59,482
So it felt more like...

443
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,758
make sure
they've got eyes on me.

444
00:23:04,206 --> 00:23:06,724
PROBST:
All right, Drew, Julie,
Jake, got nothing for you.

445
00:23:06,827 --> 00:23:07,862
Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.

446
00:23:07,965 --> 00:23:09,137
Thanks, Jeff.

447
00:23:09,241 --> 00:23:10,620
AUSTIN:
It hurt not picking Drew,

448
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:12,758
but my plan
is to keep all eyes on Julie.

449
00:23:12,862 --> 00:23:14,068
And I also knew

450
00:23:14,172 --> 00:23:17,896
a combination
of Drew, Julie and Jake--

451
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,620
yeah, they're
not going anywhere.

452
00:23:19,724 --> 00:23:22,551
They are at war with each other.

453
00:23:30,137 --> 00:23:31,689
Are you feeling like something's
missing in your life?

454
00:23:31,793 --> 00:23:33,586
You need
a little hip in your hop?

455
00:23:33,689 --> 00:23:36,620
I got an idea.
Apply to be on Survivor.

456
00:23:45,068 --> 00:23:46,275
Okay.

457
00:23:46,379 --> 00:23:47,827
Do we want to eat their rice?

458
00:23:47,931 --> 00:23:49,517
-Yeah.
-We can have dinner later.

459
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,379
Whatever you want to do.

460
00:23:51,482 --> 00:23:52,896
Sorry y'all didn't get picked.

461
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,724
Sorry you didn't get it,
Julie, too.

462
00:23:54,827 --> 00:23:56,827
Sounded beautiful.

463
00:23:56,931 --> 00:23:59,275
-You guys been in a helicopter?
-I would've been sick
on the helicopter ride.

464
00:23:59,379 --> 00:24:01,862
I've been only in a helicopter
once, and I threw up.

465
00:24:01,965 --> 00:24:03,241
Me too.

466
00:24:03,344 --> 00:24:04,482
DREW:
So, the reward challenge,

467
00:24:04,586 --> 00:24:06,137
Austin chooses Dee and Katurah.

468
00:24:06,241 --> 00:24:08,586
So he basically says
that I'm the babysitter

469
00:24:08,689 --> 00:24:10,793
and that here at home,
causing a ruckus,

470
00:24:10,896 --> 00:24:14,482
are these two demon children,
Julie and Jake.

471
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:17,068
And I need to just stick there
and make sure they don't

472
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:18,620
get into too much trouble.

473
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:21,206
Let's just sit and make some
rice for a while and chat.

474
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,862
-JAKE: Yeah.
-But I can get some peppers
from that other bush.

475
00:24:23,965 --> 00:24:25,482
Jake can come with me.

476
00:24:25,586 --> 00:24:27,137
We'll stick together,
so you don't have to worry.

477
00:24:27,241 --> 00:24:29,482
I know you have a job here.
That's to watch me.

478
00:24:29,586 --> 00:24:31,896
DREW:
The babysitting thing sucked

479
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,793
because I didn't
get any food, I had to

480
00:24:33,896 --> 00:24:35,172
go and take the social heat.

481
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:37,586
It made Julie distrust me
even more,

482
00:24:37,689 --> 00:24:40,172
and I couldn't
look for idols myself,

483
00:24:40,275 --> 00:24:42,034
because I was stuck
watching those two.

484
00:24:48,103 --> 00:24:49,931
-I know me, personally.
-Yeah, no.

485
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:54,379
JULIE:
Up until now, I've had
this great alliance,

486
00:24:54,482 --> 00:24:56,965
but my alliance
has already taken shots at me,

487
00:24:57,068 --> 00:24:58,517
so I can't trust them anymore.

488
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,965
So, now

489
00:25:00,068 --> 00:25:02,931
I got nothing to save me
unless I can find an idol.

490
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:08,206
Great.

491
00:25:09,586 --> 00:25:11,103
-That's what I'm saying.
Let's be the fun ones.
-[chuckles]

492
00:25:11,206 --> 00:25:12,413
JAKE: Austin clearly thinks

493
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:14,275
Julie needs babysitting,
but I'm not

494
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:17,310
babysitting a grown woman.
I'm not doing that.

495
00:25:17,413 --> 00:25:19,068
There's only a couple days
left in this game

496
00:25:19,172 --> 00:25:21,275
and I need to focus on me.
I don't care about Julie.

497
00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:24,448
So, yes, we were telling Drew
we were looking for peppers.

498
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:27,551
We were looking
for peppers under rocks.

499
00:25:27,655 --> 00:25:28,896
We were looking for peppers,

500
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,206
you know, under the leaves,
in the trees.

501
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,241
We were looking
for peppers everywhere.

502
00:25:32,344 --> 00:25:34,034
I need some spice in this game.

503
00:25:35,724 --> 00:25:37,896
-What?
-He's coming back,
so we got to find those peppers.

504
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,034
Yeah, we were looking for idols.
Yeah.

505
00:25:44,862 --> 00:25:46,310
[group cheering]

506
00:26:12,586 --> 00:26:13,620
Aw...

507
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:17,827
[Dee laughing]

508
00:26:22,034 --> 00:26:23,379
Oh, no!

509
00:26:27,758 --> 00:26:29,793
[Jake vocalizing]

510
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:37,827
I want you to know
that I spend an hour a day

511
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:41,793
scraping rice off the side
of this crusty,

512
00:26:41,896 --> 00:26:43,551
gross, dirty pot, so...

513
00:26:43,655 --> 00:26:45,586
Yeah, but
we're doing pretty bad.

514
00:26:49,034 --> 00:26:50,793
-[laughs]
-Oh, that's awesome.

515
00:26:50,896 --> 00:26:52,206
[Dee whoops]

516
00:26:55,137 --> 00:26:56,517
[both laughing]

517
00:27:01,172 --> 00:27:03,000
KATURAH: When I first
got picked for the reward,

518
00:27:03,103 --> 00:27:06,827
I was just too excited to think
about anything else. But then,

519
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:08,413
as the two of them
were sitting closer

520
00:27:08,517 --> 00:27:11,137
than me and Dee were sitting,
I was like, "Oh, right.

521
00:27:11,241 --> 00:27:12,448
I'm a third wheel."

522
00:27:13,517 --> 00:27:15,172
And of course I would
look over every now and then,

523
00:27:15,275 --> 00:27:17,413
and I'd see
a little hand on another thigh

524
00:27:17,517 --> 00:27:20,965
or something like that,
but, you know, do what

525
00:27:21,068 --> 00:27:22,206
y'all need to do.

526
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,034
Keep your head
in that lover's lane.

527
00:27:24,137 --> 00:27:26,517
I'm-a be over here thinking
about how to win this million.

528
00:27:27,551 --> 00:27:29,103
-AUSTIN: This is amazing.
-KATURAH: Oh, my God.

529
00:27:29,206 --> 00:27:31,517
This is
the best friggin' day ever!

530
00:27:34,413 --> 00:27:36,517
-[chuckles]
-AUSTIN: I love this.
This is awesome.

531
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,517
DEE:
Wow.

532
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,206
KATURAH:
I'm so happy you chose me.

533
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,689
Like, I mean, I knew
you were gonna choose Dee.

534
00:27:42,793 --> 00:27:45,482
I was like, "Yeah." Well, I was
excited that you were going.

535
00:27:45,586 --> 00:27:46,793
-Looking at me.
-Did you know?

536
00:27:46,896 --> 00:27:49,206
-Yeah, did you know?
-I had a feeling.

537
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,931
-[chuckles]
-DEE: Austin's relationship
and I is progressing.

538
00:27:52,034 --> 00:27:54,034
Um, any time a man
tells you something,

539
00:27:54,137 --> 00:27:55,655
you should never believe them

540
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:58,724
until he puts actions
behind his words.

541
00:27:58,827 --> 00:28:00,448
And Austin did that
when he chose me

542
00:28:00,551 --> 00:28:02,137
first for the reward.

543
00:28:02,241 --> 00:28:03,689
When he said, "Okay, Dee,"

544
00:28:03,793 --> 00:28:05,103
I'm like, "Oh, damn. Okay."

545
00:28:05,206 --> 00:28:06,724
I'm feeling like
I'm your number one, then.

546
00:28:06,827 --> 00:28:08,862
Like, you put some action.
It wasn't really strategy.

547
00:28:08,965 --> 00:28:12,689
It was more like, "Hey,
I want to spend this afternoon

548
00:28:12,793 --> 00:28:14,310
having this experience
with you."

549
00:28:14,413 --> 00:28:17,206
That's the way I took it.
And I was happy about it, so...

550
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,275
Yeah.

551
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:20,827
What's the question?

552
00:28:23,655 --> 00:28:26,068
Yeah, I need to spice things up.

553
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:27,137
KATURAH:
Mm-hmm.

554
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:28,344
DEE:
Well...

555
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,379
[laughing]:
I am a little bit smitten.

556
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,896
I don't know
how to answer the question.

557
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,310
He's a cool guy.
I like him.

558
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:41,241
DEE:
Austin, this is
the best day ever.

559
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,551
-Thank you so much.
-AUSTIN: This is
the best day ever. Of course.

560
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:45,068
-We can finish this.
-Mm-hmm.

561
00:28:45,172 --> 00:28:46,931
You can definitely
finish it more.

562
00:28:47,034 --> 00:28:48,482
I've got space.

563
00:28:48,586 --> 00:28:50,103
-You've got space?
-[Katurah laughs]

564
00:28:50,206 --> 00:28:51,655
AUSTIN: Dee is someone,
in the real world,

565
00:28:51,758 --> 00:28:53,413
I would be intimidated

566
00:28:53,517 --> 00:28:54,896
of ever talking to,

567
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,517
because she is just, like,
she's... she's awesome.

568
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,482
She's, like, so cool. You know?

569
00:29:01,586 --> 00:29:04,379
The past few years,
I've really been able

570
00:29:04,482 --> 00:29:06,344
to develop
my own self-confidence.

571
00:29:06,448 --> 00:29:08,689
I used to be very nervous,

572
00:29:08,793 --> 00:29:11,068
very anxious, more introverted.

573
00:29:11,172 --> 00:29:12,655
I was a little chubby.

574
00:29:12,758 --> 00:29:15,137
I had braces from elementary
school till high school

575
00:29:15,241 --> 00:29:17,689
and, like,
12 years of bad acne.

576
00:29:17,793 --> 00:29:19,620
And I've come so far.

577
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:22,413
But coming out here
has pushed me to a new level.

578
00:29:22,517 --> 00:29:24,620
It's made me way more confident.

579
00:29:24,724 --> 00:29:27,448
And it's, like,
definitely a crazy,

580
00:29:27,551 --> 00:29:29,379
big confidence boost
to have someone

581
00:29:29,482 --> 00:29:32,827
as cool as Dee,
like, like me or whatever.

582
00:29:32,931 --> 00:29:34,379
You know?
Like, I love it.

583
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:36,310
I'm so glad
to be here with y'all.

584
00:29:36,413 --> 00:29:38,448
-Survivor45!
-AUSTIN: On a helicopter.

585
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:40,310
[all cheering]

586
00:29:40,413 --> 00:29:42,172
DEE:
New era, baby.

587
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:51,000
All right,
how's this for seawater?

588
00:29:51,103 --> 00:29:52,310
More or less?
What do you think?

589
00:29:52,413 --> 00:29:53,586
Good. Perfect.

590
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,241
DREW:
Do you have
the scooper for me, Jake?

591
00:29:56,344 --> 00:29:58,551
Let me look.
Where did it go?

592
00:29:58,655 --> 00:30:01,724
The reward challenge,
uh, did not go my way.

593
00:30:01,827 --> 00:30:03,758
I lost.
Austin wins.

594
00:30:03,862 --> 00:30:06,137
He takes Dee
and he takes Katurah.

595
00:30:06,241 --> 00:30:07,689
Everyone on that helicopter

596
00:30:07,793 --> 00:30:09,965
is the people I want
to scheme with right now.

597
00:30:10,068 --> 00:30:11,793
Meanwhile, I'm stuck here
with my next two targets.

598
00:30:11,896 --> 00:30:13,310
In my head, I'm thinking,

599
00:30:13,413 --> 00:30:16,068
the only way I can win the game:
if I get something

600
00:30:16,172 --> 00:30:17,896
and do something flashy
in front of the jury.

601
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,793
And to do that,
I need some firepower.

602
00:30:19,896 --> 00:30:22,724
I'm going down the beach
a little bit. I'm gonna change.

603
00:30:22,827 --> 00:30:23,724
So I need to find

604
00:30:23,827 --> 00:30:25,034
my idol now.

605
00:30:25,137 --> 00:30:28,206
Julie played an idol
last Tribal.

606
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:31,034
It's here somewhere.
I need to find it now.

607
00:30:32,103 --> 00:30:34,206
I want the hidden immunity idol
to remain hidden

608
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,896
from everyone else
other than me.

609
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,517
Even though
I want to work with Julie,

610
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,655
she can't know
that I found something.

611
00:30:38,758 --> 00:30:40,689
I need to focus on me.

612
00:30:40,793 --> 00:30:42,793
I don't care about Julie.
I care about Jake.

613
00:30:42,896 --> 00:30:45,517
I've looked a bunch
in this game for idols, so far.

614
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,862
I've been very unlucky,

615
00:30:46,965 --> 00:30:48,724
but I'm looking in the trees

616
00:30:48,827 --> 00:30:51,206
that look similar to where Bruce
found his Beware Advantage.

617
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,310
I'm digging around.

618
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,827
I got it.

619
00:30:58,793 --> 00:31:00,655
And then I open it.

620
00:31:07,482 --> 00:31:09,275
It's not an idol.

621
00:31:09,379 --> 00:31:11,689
It's a clue
to the hidden immunity idol.

622
00:31:17,689 --> 00:31:18,896
Okay, I can do that.

623
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,586
I need to go get this now.

624
00:31:20,689 --> 00:31:24,206
No one else is finding my idol.
That is my idol.

625
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:29,068
So I go over to the raft,
I strip down to my underwear.

626
00:31:29,172 --> 00:31:31,827
So, you know, if people find me,
they're gonna know,

627
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:32,965
"Yeah, hey, I'm getting changed.

628
00:31:33,068 --> 00:31:34,517
You know,
I'm not fully clothed."

629
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,206
Plus, it's fun to search
in my underwear, you know?

630
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,896
I've done a play before where
I had to be in my underwear

631
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,724
onstage
in front of other people,

632
00:31:41,827 --> 00:31:43,206
so I'm not super concerned

633
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,793
about searching
for this idol in my underwear.

634
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,689
It's-it's good. It was...

635
00:31:46,793 --> 00:31:49,517
it was a show.
I was in college. Uh...

636
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:53,413
[laughs] Um... So,

637
00:31:53,517 --> 00:31:55,241
I'm searching for this idol
in my underwear.

638
00:31:58,241 --> 00:31:59,758
Nothing comes easy this season.

639
00:31:59,862 --> 00:32:01,413
Jeff is pulling zero punches.

640
00:32:01,517 --> 00:32:03,517
He is going all out,
making this difficult for me,

641
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,241
which, you know, it's fine.

642
00:32:05,344 --> 00:32:06,931
If nothing's a challenge,
is it really worth doing?

643
00:32:07,034 --> 00:32:08,379
You know what I mean?

644
00:32:13,206 --> 00:32:14,172
And then I see it.

645
00:32:14,275 --> 00:32:15,310
It almost looks like a cap

646
00:32:15,413 --> 00:32:16,689
that I can pull off.

647
00:32:16,793 --> 00:32:18,827
You got to be kidding me.

648
00:32:19,793 --> 00:32:21,310
[vocalizes]

649
00:32:21,413 --> 00:32:22,655
Ta-da!

650
00:32:22,758 --> 00:32:23,965
It's my hidden immunity idol.

651
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:28,827
Yeah, my idol...
is now my crotch idol.

652
00:32:29,827 --> 00:32:33,586
"Congratulations. You have
found a hidden immunity idol."

653
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,517
Let's put that back,
make it look good as new.

654
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,344
No one's gonna know a thing.

655
00:32:41,448 --> 00:32:43,413
I would like
to get innovative with this.

656
00:32:43,517 --> 00:32:45,379
I need to play this
and have it do more

657
00:32:45,482 --> 00:32:48,379
than just save me in this game
for another vote.

658
00:32:48,482 --> 00:32:50,689
I need this to earn me votes
in Final Tribal.

659
00:32:50,793 --> 00:32:52,344
That's what this is right here.

660
00:32:52,448 --> 00:32:56,206
And I need to figure out
how to best implement it.

661
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,206
I'm coming back.
I'm not out of this game.

662
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,448
I'm still in it.
I'm still a threat.

663
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:03,655
I'm a wolf in goat's clothing.

664
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:19,758
Come on in!

665
00:33:21,689 --> 00:33:24,655
-Looking good, Jeff.
-So are you all.

666
00:33:24,758 --> 00:33:26,000
Yeah.

667
00:33:26,103 --> 00:33:29,172
PROBST:
Day 23 Survivor45.

668
00:33:31,862 --> 00:33:33,724
-[whooping]
-All right.

669
00:33:33,827 --> 00:33:36,482
PROBST:
Jake, Julie, Dee,

670
00:33:36,586 --> 00:33:38,344
Austin, Drew and Katurah.

671
00:33:38,448 --> 00:33:40,862
How you feeling today?
I feel like

672
00:33:40,965 --> 00:33:42,379
now there's more energy today.

673
00:33:42,482 --> 00:33:45,000
Jake, you're talking
to your buddies,

674
00:33:45,103 --> 00:33:47,103
and you're telling them
about this moment right here.

675
00:33:47,206 --> 00:33:48,620
"Probst is asking
what it's like.

676
00:33:48,724 --> 00:33:50,379
You know what I told him?
I told him..."

677
00:33:50,482 --> 00:33:53,172
I told him
it's no-holds-barred right now.

678
00:33:53,275 --> 00:33:55,172
This is every man and woman
for themselves, you know?

679
00:33:55,275 --> 00:33:57,275
Two whole tribes
have been eliminated.

680
00:33:57,379 --> 00:33:59,103
Six? That's a starting tribe.

681
00:33:59,206 --> 00:34:00,689
This is what we started on,
kind of.

682
00:34:00,793 --> 00:34:02,862
-[Julie squeaks]
-So now...

683
00:34:02,965 --> 00:34:05,655
we're cannibalizing ourselves,
and, you know,

684
00:34:05,758 --> 00:34:07,379
we're gonna have a fun time
doing it, right, guys?

685
00:34:07,482 --> 00:34:09,034
-Yup, for sure.
-Yeah.
-JULIE: Right, right.

686
00:34:09,137 --> 00:34:11,862
All right, shall we get
to today's immunity challenge?

687
00:34:11,965 --> 00:34:14,688
-[all voicing assent]
-First things first, Drew.

688
00:34:15,688 --> 00:34:17,344
Got to take it back.

689
00:34:17,447 --> 00:34:19,000
-DEE: He kneels down.
He goes down.
-KATURAH: He kneels.

690
00:34:19,103 --> 00:34:20,344
Thank you.

691
00:34:20,447 --> 00:34:22,827
Appreciate the kneel.

692
00:34:22,931 --> 00:34:24,620
Just a little bit. [laughs]

693
00:34:24,724 --> 00:34:28,482
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

694
00:34:28,585 --> 00:34:30,310
For today's challenge,

695
00:34:30,413 --> 00:34:32,620
you're gonna put one foot

696
00:34:32,724 --> 00:34:35,516
on one end of a hinged beam.

697
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,137
At the other end is a ball.

698
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,655
Your job: keep that ball
up there as long as you can.

699
00:34:40,757 --> 00:34:42,620
When your ball drops,

700
00:34:42,724 --> 00:34:44,931
you're out.

701
00:34:45,034 --> 00:34:46,793
-Last person left standing
wins immunity.
-[whooping]

702
00:34:46,896 --> 00:34:48,793
Safe tonight
at Tribal Council,

703
00:34:48,896 --> 00:34:53,137
guaranteed a spot
in the final five.

704
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:55,206
Losers, Tribal Council
where somebody will be

705
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:57,655
the thirteenth person voted out

706
00:34:57,758 --> 00:34:59,758
of Survivor45
and become the sixth member

707
00:34:59,862 --> 00:35:02,103
of our jury.
Big enough stakes?

708
00:35:02,206 --> 00:35:03,655
-Heck, yeah.
-Of course.
-All right, let's draw

709
00:35:03,758 --> 00:35:06,172
for spots.
We'll get it on. Here we go.

710
00:35:13,275 --> 00:35:14,758
All right, here we go.

711
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,379
I'm gonna count you in.

712
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:19,068
When I get to zero, you need
to have a foot up there,

713
00:35:19,172 --> 00:35:20,724
release your gate,

714
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,965
challenge is on.

715
00:35:22,068 --> 00:35:24,379
Five, four,

716
00:35:24,482 --> 00:35:25,965
three,

717
00:35:26,068 --> 00:35:27,655
two, one.

718
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:30,000
Everybody release.

719
00:35:31,068 --> 00:35:33,241
Everybody's good.
This challenge is on.

720
00:35:33,344 --> 00:35:35,896
And balls are moving right away.

721
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,137
Your job: steady it out.

722
00:35:39,241 --> 00:35:40,827
If you're at the far end
of the beam,

723
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:44,103
that's the safest spot,
because you've got a little lip.

724
00:35:44,206 --> 00:35:47,655
Katurah's ball
right where it started.

725
00:35:47,758 --> 00:35:50,551
Little movement by Austin.

726
00:35:50,655 --> 00:35:52,517
Dee nice and steady.

727
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,551
Jake looking good.

728
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:58,551
Drew, nice balance work.

729
00:35:58,655 --> 00:36:00,586
Julie very steady.

730
00:36:00,689 --> 00:36:02,862
That ball has not moved
from where it started.

731
00:36:04,137 --> 00:36:06,137
It's a brand-new
Survivorchallenge.

732
00:36:06,241 --> 00:36:08,689
You are the first to do it.

733
00:36:08,793 --> 00:36:12,034
Whoever wins it will be in five.

734
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:15,310
You'll have that necklace
tonight at Tribal Council.

735
00:36:15,413 --> 00:36:18,448
It's hard to balance on a day
when you're feeling 100%,

736
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,172
much less day 23 of Survivor.

737
00:36:20,275 --> 00:36:21,758
-Julie's ball moves.
-No, no, no!

738
00:36:21,862 --> 00:36:23,103
Julie's the first casualty.

739
00:36:23,206 --> 00:36:24,620
-Julie is out.
-JULIE: Son of a gun!

740
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:27,724
PROBST:
And now we have Jake,
arms flapping

741
00:36:27,827 --> 00:36:30,172
to get his balance in control.

742
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,689
Jake drops. Jake is out.

743
00:36:33,793 --> 00:36:36,827
We are down to four,
just like that.

744
00:36:36,931 --> 00:36:38,620
Drew, then Dee,

745
00:36:38,724 --> 00:36:42,068
Katurah and Austin

746
00:36:42,172 --> 00:36:44,310
fighting for immunity.

747
00:36:46,241 --> 00:36:49,586
You are only two minutes
into this challenge

748
00:36:49,689 --> 00:36:51,482
and you're already hurting.

749
00:36:51,586 --> 00:36:54,379
You're gonna feel it
on that down leg

750
00:36:54,482 --> 00:36:56,482
as much as anything.

751
00:36:56,586 --> 00:36:59,068
-More.
-More.

752
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,931
Katurah's ball
slowly on the move.

753
00:37:03,034 --> 00:37:05,206
And a nice adjustment
by Katurah.

754
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:07,620
Katurah the only person left
in this challenge

755
00:37:07,724 --> 00:37:09,310
-who hasn't won immunity.
-Aw, no. No, no, no, no.

756
00:37:09,413 --> 00:37:10,931
-JAKE: Don't. Relax.
-PROBST: Can she save it
right there?

757
00:37:11,034 --> 00:37:13,068
-JAKE: Relax.
-PROBST:
Katurah in a dangerous spot,

758
00:37:13,172 --> 00:37:15,034
but she's held it.

759
00:37:16,551 --> 00:37:18,931
But she can't anymore.
Katurah's out.

760
00:37:19,034 --> 00:37:20,275
We're down to three.

761
00:37:20,379 --> 00:37:22,413
It is Drew,

762
00:37:22,517 --> 00:37:24,724
Dee and Austin.

763
00:37:24,827 --> 00:37:28,758
All three have won
individual immunity.

764
00:37:28,862 --> 00:37:30,896
It will be the second win
for one of them,

765
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,206
and it will guarantee you a spot
in the final five.

766
00:37:35,241 --> 00:37:37,758
Question is who will it be?

767
00:37:37,862 --> 00:37:39,862
How are you feeling, Austin?

768
00:37:39,965 --> 00:37:42,068
Uh... I don't know.

769
00:37:42,172 --> 00:37:43,655
How about you?

770
00:37:43,758 --> 00:37:45,862
-I feel good.
-AUSTIN: All right.

771
00:37:45,965 --> 00:37:48,310
I feel how I felt minute one.

772
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:50,413
[Austin and Dee laugh]

773
00:37:59,482 --> 00:38:01,551
PROBST:
Been up there seven minutes now.

774
00:38:06,586 --> 00:38:09,689
Right now, all you're thinking
about is eye on that ball.

775
00:38:09,793 --> 00:38:13,827
Keep that ball
at the far end of this beam.

776
00:38:15,206 --> 00:38:18,310
You just don't want
any erratic movements.

777
00:38:21,034 --> 00:38:25,586
You can see how just
a tiny twitch is all it takes.

778
00:38:27,965 --> 00:38:31,034
A lot of movement from Drew,
but he's hanging in there.

779
00:38:33,068 --> 00:38:35,172
Another nice save by Drew.

780
00:38:38,862 --> 00:38:40,310
And another.

781
00:38:40,413 --> 00:38:41,655
DEE:
Nice job, Drew.

782
00:38:41,758 --> 00:38:43,206
PROBST:
And another.

783
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:44,793
-AUSTIN: Oh, my gosh.
-PROBST: Drew continues to fight

784
00:38:44,896 --> 00:38:46,034
in this challenge to stay in it.

785
00:38:46,137 --> 00:38:48,482
DEE: Keep fighting, Drew.
Keep fighting.

786
00:38:48,586 --> 00:38:51,241
What the heck is happening
over there?

787
00:38:51,344 --> 00:38:52,655
PROBST:
Look at that. Hopping around,

788
00:38:52,758 --> 00:38:54,827
trying to keep it going.

789
00:38:54,931 --> 00:38:56,413
-Oh...
-Oh, my gosh.
-PROBST: Drew's ball

790
00:38:56,517 --> 00:38:58,655
-is all over the place,
but he continues
-All right, easy,

791
00:38:58,758 --> 00:38:59,551
-to save it.
-easy, easy, easy.

792
00:39:02,241 --> 00:39:03,689
-JULIE: Wow.
-KATURAH: Wow.
-JAKE: Wow.

793
00:39:03,793 --> 00:39:05,206
JULIE:
Drew, that was amazing.

794
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,965
PROBST:
Drew back in that safe spot

795
00:39:07,068 --> 00:39:08,379
at the end.

796
00:39:08,482 --> 00:39:09,793
JULIE:
Looking good, Drew.

797
00:39:09,896 --> 00:39:11,448
PROBST:
Been up there 12 minutes now.

798
00:39:11,551 --> 00:39:12,965
KATURAH:
You guys are killing it.

799
00:39:13,068 --> 00:39:14,551
PROBST:
Keep digging.

800
00:39:14,655 --> 00:39:16,758
You never know when
two people are gonna drop

801
00:39:16,862 --> 00:39:18,413
and it's you that wins.

802
00:39:21,241 --> 00:39:22,724
-JULIE: Oh...
-PROBST: Drew drops.

803
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:24,724
Drew is out.
We're down to two.

804
00:39:24,827 --> 00:39:26,931
-KATURAH: Great effort, Drew.
-It is Dee and Austin

805
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:28,379
fighting for immunity.

806
00:39:28,482 --> 00:39:30,896
Here we go.
Day 23.

807
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,517
-Drew, that was awesome.
-That was incredible.

808
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:38,241
Dee and Austin
have been very steady.

809
00:39:40,793 --> 00:39:43,000
Austin, little bit of movement
with that ball,

810
00:39:43,103 --> 00:39:44,620
but he's in the safe zone.

811
00:39:44,724 --> 00:39:46,862
Why are you moving so much?

812
00:39:46,965 --> 00:39:49,137
I'm getting bored.

813
00:39:56,689 --> 00:39:59,000
Comes down to this.

814
00:39:59,103 --> 00:40:01,413
Dee, who's won immunity,

815
00:40:01,517 --> 00:40:03,655
versus Austin,
who has won immunity.

816
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:06,931
There's only one necklace.
One of you will be

817
00:40:07,034 --> 00:40:10,586
guaranteed safe tonight
at Tribal Council.

818
00:40:13,793 --> 00:40:16,413
Been up there 19 minutes now.

819
00:40:16,517 --> 00:40:18,551
-[whooping]
-Wow.

820
00:40:18,655 --> 00:40:20,655
When we tested this
with our dream team

821
00:40:20,758 --> 00:40:23,241
to make sure it works,

822
00:40:23,344 --> 00:40:25,758
the winning time was 21 minutes.

823
00:40:25,862 --> 00:40:27,551
-KATURAH: Wow.
-JAKE: Whoa.

824
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,758
[laughs] Right.

825
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,310
PROBST:
Balls in two
very different spots.

826
00:40:35,413 --> 00:40:37,517
Austin is safe right now,

827
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:40,344
but Dee is very close
to being in trouble.

828
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:43,758
But her ball has not moved
in a long time.

829
00:40:44,931 --> 00:40:47,862
Little bit
of movement from Austin.

830
00:40:47,965 --> 00:40:49,758
What's going on, Austin?

831
00:40:49,862 --> 00:40:51,241
I just want
to get a little movement in.

832
00:40:51,344 --> 00:40:52,965
-Why? It hurts a little bit?
-No.

833
00:40:53,068 --> 00:40:56,517
Smack talk
at an all-time high on day 23.

834
00:40:58,275 --> 00:41:00,724
You've been up there
21 minutes now.

835
00:41:00,827 --> 00:41:03,275
-Ooh. Good job, guys.
-Well done.

836
00:41:03,379 --> 00:41:05,310
Nobody cares about a record.

837
00:41:05,413 --> 00:41:07,965
You want the necklace.

838
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:13,827
Austin's ball on the move again.

839
00:41:13,931 --> 00:41:15,586
Yeah, don't worry, don't worry.

840
00:41:15,689 --> 00:41:17,689
PROBST:
Making its way around
that safe zone and back in.

841
00:41:17,793 --> 00:41:20,068
-Not worried?
-No. Why would I be worried?

842
00:41:20,172 --> 00:41:22,620
As Dee continues

843
00:41:22,724 --> 00:41:25,586
to be like a statue.

844
00:41:27,586 --> 00:41:29,206
Oh, man.

845
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:31,275
PROBST:
Keep digging.

846
00:41:31,379 --> 00:41:35,275
You never know when
the other player is gonna drop.

847
00:41:35,379 --> 00:41:36,827
Mine's not gonna move.

848
00:41:36,931 --> 00:41:38,689
PROBST:
Austin in trouble.

849
00:41:38,793 --> 00:41:41,344
-Can he save it again?
-[grunts]

850
00:41:41,448 --> 00:41:42,689
[gasps]

851
00:41:42,793 --> 00:41:44,310
PROBST:
And he doesn't. Austin drops.

852
00:41:44,413 --> 00:41:46,310
-AUSTIN: Oh, my gosh.
-PROBST: Dee wins her second

853
00:41:46,413 --> 00:41:47,827
-individual immunity.
-[Katurah whoops]

854
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,379
PROBST:
Safe tonight at Tribal Council,

855
00:41:51,482 --> 00:41:54,793
guaranteed a spot
in the final five.

856
00:41:54,896 --> 00:41:57,275
Austin can't even walk
as he goes to congratulate her.

857
00:41:57,379 --> 00:42:01,172
-Good job. Good job.
-PROBST: Wow. Both feeling it.

858
00:42:01,275 --> 00:42:02,586
Oh, my gosh.

859
00:42:05,724 --> 00:42:06,896
PROBST:
Dee, come on over.

860
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
-Yeah.
-There you go, Dee.

861
00:42:09,103 --> 00:42:12,034
For the second time
in Survivor45,

862
00:42:12,137 --> 00:42:13,827
immunity is yours.

863
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:15,172
Well earned.

864
00:42:15,275 --> 00:42:17,758
Safe tonight at Tribal Council.

865
00:42:17,862 --> 00:42:19,379
Cannot be voted out
of this game, which means

866
00:42:19,482 --> 00:42:22,137
you are guaranteed a spot
in the final five.

867
00:42:22,241 --> 00:42:24,241
Let that sink in and share.

868
00:42:25,586 --> 00:42:28,448
I feel so grateful.
Like, I don't know.

869
00:42:28,551 --> 00:42:30,689
I was just thinking of the
million dollars in that ball.

870
00:42:30,793 --> 00:42:32,241
I'm like,
"I can't drop that ball."

871
00:42:32,344 --> 00:42:34,482
And I just feel grateful
that it was a showdown, too.

872
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:36,620
I feel like it means more
when it's a showdown

873
00:42:36,724 --> 00:42:38,310
'cause you really
have to dig deep.

874
00:42:38,413 --> 00:42:40,068
PROBST:
Well earned. Dee safe tonight.

875
00:42:40,172 --> 00:42:42,793
Cannot be voted out,
guaranteed a spotted at five.

876
00:42:42,896 --> 00:42:46,000
As for the rest of you, 23 days
is a long time in Survivor.

877
00:42:46,103 --> 00:42:47,551
It's not enough.

878
00:42:47,655 --> 00:42:48,896
Somebody voted out tonight.

879
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,379
Thirteenth person voted out
will become

880
00:42:50,482 --> 00:42:52,758
the sixth member of our jury.
You have the afternoon

881
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:53,965
to figure out
who that's gonna be.

882
00:42:54,068 --> 00:42:55,551
Grab your stuff,
head back to camp.

883
00:42:55,655 --> 00:42:57,620
-See you tonight of Tribal.
Congrats.
-Thank you, Jeff.

884
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,689
DREW:
I have a plan.

885
00:43:00,793 --> 00:43:02,689
It's in place. I don't want
to have to retool it.

886
00:43:02,793 --> 00:43:04,413
There's no editing.
I don't take notes.

887
00:43:04,517 --> 00:43:08,241
Julie's existence at camp
is a reminder that we failed,

888
00:43:08,344 --> 00:43:10,172
we were outsmarted,
we were beaten.

889
00:43:10,275 --> 00:43:12,482
It's certainly not a reminder
I like having around.

890
00:43:12,586 --> 00:43:13,758
I'd like Julie
to go at this point.

891
00:43:26,655 --> 00:43:29,793
-Dee, Dee, Dee, Dee, Dee, Dee.
-[whoops] Let's go.
-Thank you, guys.

892
00:43:29,896 --> 00:43:32,793
It feels so damn good to win.

893
00:43:32,896 --> 00:43:36,413
This guarantees me a spot
at the final five,

894
00:43:36,517 --> 00:43:39,137
which is absolutely insane.

895
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:42,034
But even more than wearing this
necklace, as pretty as it is--

896
00:43:42,137 --> 00:43:43,586
you know, I want to go out
partying with it--

897
00:43:43,689 --> 00:43:45,896
it makes me feel good
'cause I'm a woman.

898
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,965
And, like, I'm going against
these men, and it's like,

899
00:43:48,068 --> 00:43:50,034
"I'm gonna give you
a run for your money,

900
00:43:50,137 --> 00:43:51,310
whether you like it or not."

901
00:43:51,413 --> 00:43:53,310
I'm gonna beat you next time.

902
00:43:53,413 --> 00:43:54,827
No, you're not.

903
00:43:54,931 --> 00:43:56,965
-I'm gonna
beat you next time.
-No, you're not.

904
00:43:57,068 --> 00:43:59,103
AUSTIN:
One hundred percent.

905
00:43:59,206 --> 00:44:01,586
Honestly, there wasn't anyone
else I'd love to go head...

906
00:44:01,689 --> 00:44:04,103
-I know. That was awesome.
-head-to-head at it with them.

907
00:44:04,206 --> 00:44:06,344
You gave me a rough time.
Uh, damn.

908
00:44:06,448 --> 00:44:07,965
[scoffs] Didn't look like it.
What the heck?

909
00:44:08,068 --> 00:44:10,517
I was like, "This guy's
not gonna freaking quit."

910
00:44:15,655 --> 00:44:17,172
AUSTIN:
That immunity challenge went

911
00:44:17,275 --> 00:44:19,137
almost as well
as I could have hoped.

912
00:44:19,241 --> 00:44:21,931
Obviously, if I won, that would
have been the cherry on top.

913
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,862
It definitely makes it easier

914
00:44:23,965 --> 00:44:25,482
losing to someone
that I care about,

915
00:44:25,586 --> 00:44:27,482
someone who is very close to me,

916
00:44:27,586 --> 00:44:29,379
both strategically
and personally.

917
00:44:29,482 --> 00:44:31,793
But immediately,
Julie goes down.

918
00:44:31,896 --> 00:44:33,413
That's who we needed
to be out.

919
00:44:33,517 --> 00:44:36,172
That way, we can finish what
we started last Tribal Council.

920
00:44:36,275 --> 00:44:38,896
It took one time
to knock out my idol,

921
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,241
and this is the time
we finish the job.

922
00:44:41,344 --> 00:44:43,517
So, I think
we all know what, uh...

923
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:44,655
JAKE:
Yeah.

924
00:44:44,758 --> 00:44:46,000
DREW:
Where our heads are at.

925
00:44:46,103 --> 00:44:47,517
-JAKE: No, we're good.
-AUSTIN: Yeah, um...

926
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:50,000
'Cause in my book it's, like,
it's a sure thing, so...

927
00:44:50,103 --> 00:44:52,034
JAKE:
It would be very easy
for me to say,

928
00:44:52,137 --> 00:44:53,586
"Yup, we're going
on Julie again.

929
00:44:53,689 --> 00:44:55,482
We're putting
all the votes on Julie."

930
00:44:55,586 --> 00:44:57,620
But...

931
00:44:57,724 --> 00:44:59,310
that doesn't help Jake's résumé.

932
00:44:59,413 --> 00:45:02,379
That doesn't help Jake's résumé
one bit, so...

933
00:45:02,482 --> 00:45:06,275
Julie and I don't have
the best history, but

934
00:45:06,379 --> 00:45:09,000
Julie playing in desperation
is a great thing for Jake.

935
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,310
-Yup.
-Right?

936
00:45:12,413 --> 00:45:14,793
-Right.
-What would I be doing

937
00:45:14,896 --> 00:45:17,379
if I decided
to dogpile on you again?

938
00:45:17,482 --> 00:45:20,034
-Yeah.
-Like, I don't think
that helps my game at all.

939
00:45:20,137 --> 00:45:21,931
-It doesn't... It'd be...
-So, I don't... I would be...

940
00:45:22,034 --> 00:45:23,655
-It'd be following
somebody else's.
-Yes. Yes.

941
00:45:23,758 --> 00:45:26,172
So, are you open
to anything this next round?

942
00:45:26,275 --> 00:45:29,758
-Yes. Yes.
-Okay, so here's
what I want to do.

943
00:45:34,068 --> 00:45:36,551
-Ooh. Interesting.
-Because

944
00:45:36,655 --> 00:45:38,655
anyone sits next to him
in final three, it's over.

945
00:45:38,758 --> 00:45:41,137
-Yeah.
-It's over because he's one

946
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:43,000
-of the best speakers
I've ever met in my life.
-You're right.

947
00:45:43,103 --> 00:45:46,482
JULIE:
Since the entire tribe
tried to vote me out,

948
00:45:46,586 --> 00:45:49,793
this is my only play.

949
00:45:49,896 --> 00:45:51,862
So, he's saying the words,
and I'm just,

950
00:45:51,965 --> 00:45:54,586
"You're right, you're right,
you're right."

951
00:45:54,689 --> 00:45:58,344
What he doesn't know
is that I'm working with Dee,

952
00:45:58,448 --> 00:46:01,862
and that she is down
for writing Drew's name.

953
00:46:01,965 --> 00:46:03,931
But I can't
let Jake know that.

954
00:46:04,034 --> 00:46:06,034
Oh.

955
00:46:06,137 --> 00:46:09,310
If it all goes well, there will
be actually four names on Drew.

956
00:46:09,413 --> 00:46:11,724
-That's how I'm looking at it
right now.
-Okay.

957
00:46:11,827 --> 00:46:13,482
Are you opposed to that?

958
00:46:13,586 --> 00:46:14,586
-I'm not.
-Okay.

959
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:16,862
Right now, every move I make

960
00:46:16,965 --> 00:46:18,758
is absolutely crucial.

961
00:46:18,862 --> 00:46:20,655
I need to take ownership
of every person

962
00:46:20,758 --> 00:46:24,034
who gets voted out of this game
up until Final Tribal.

963
00:46:24,137 --> 00:46:26,241
I need to be
in absolute control.

964
00:46:26,344 --> 00:46:27,655
If we go on Julie tonight,

965
00:46:27,758 --> 00:46:29,172
where's the move
in Jake and Katurah?

966
00:46:29,275 --> 00:46:30,793
-Exactly.
-It doesn't look like
we're the boss.

967
00:46:30,896 --> 00:46:32,379
-You know what I mean?
-Exactly.

968
00:46:32,482 --> 00:46:34,517
-They're three, we're two.
-I was thinking the same thing.

969
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:36,758
-It might be time
to blindside somebody.
-I agree.

970
00:46:36,862 --> 00:46:38,413
JAKE:
You want to put three on Drew?

971
00:46:38,517 --> 00:46:40,827
-KATURAH: I'm 100%
down with that.
-JAKE: Okay.

972
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:42,379
Julie is 100% in.
Julie would be fine.

973
00:46:42,482 --> 00:46:44,137
I was like,
"Julie would be 100% in."

974
00:46:44,241 --> 00:46:45,758
I think I can get Dee.

975
00:46:45,862 --> 00:46:47,482
I wouldn't even pull Dee.

976
00:46:47,586 --> 00:46:49,137
Dee might ruin it.
Because if it leaks

977
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:51,137
and he plays an idol,
we don't get a move.

978
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:52,965
The way that
this is supposed to work

979
00:46:53,068 --> 00:46:54,931
is myself, Julie, and Katurah--
that's three votes.

980
00:46:55,034 --> 00:46:57,000
That's 50%.

981
00:46:57,103 --> 00:46:59,827
We put them all on Drew.
We put three votes on Drew.

982
00:47:00,896 --> 00:47:05,931
Now, if Drew, Dee and Austin
put three votes on Julie,

983
00:47:06,034 --> 00:47:08,172
we run into a tie.

984
00:47:08,275 --> 00:47:10,275
If I get the votes to be a tie,

985
00:47:10,379 --> 00:47:13,241
I believe I can get Dee
or Austin to flip at a revote.

986
00:47:13,344 --> 00:47:15,068
Now, this is very similar
to the move

987
00:47:15,172 --> 00:47:16,620
that I tried to pull with Kaleb,

988
00:47:16,724 --> 00:47:19,206
and to save Kaleb
and pull Julie out.

989
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:22,620
So, in a way, I'm hoping
to get some redemption tonight.

990
00:47:22,724 --> 00:47:24,827
-It's 100% a move for us.
-Okay.

991
00:47:24,931 --> 00:47:27,551
Dee can't take credit for it,
and we have something over Dee

992
00:47:27,655 --> 00:47:29,034
-in final three
if she's there with us.
-Yeah. Yeah.

993
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:30,586
Okay, okay, okay.

994
00:47:30,689 --> 00:47:32,379
Damn, that makes sense.
I didn't think of it that way.

995
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:34,241
JAKE:
Now, some people might think
it's ludicrous

996
00:47:34,344 --> 00:47:37,655
for me to rely on Katurah twice
in a similar manner, but

997
00:47:37,758 --> 00:47:39,172
I believe our interests align.

998
00:47:39,275 --> 00:47:40,758
Katurah needs some moves.

999
00:47:40,862 --> 00:47:42,965
If I can make her feel
like it's her thing, too--

1000
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,689
even though it's not--

1001
00:47:44,793 --> 00:47:48,137
my winner potential goes up,
so I don't want her telling Dee.

1002
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:49,758
-KATURAH: One, two,
-DEE: Two,

1003
00:47:49,862 --> 00:47:51,862
-three. Drew.
-three. Drew. [laughing]

1004
00:47:57,206 --> 00:47:58,758
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

1005
00:47:58,862 --> 00:48:00,965
-Yeah, they're coming
for us for sure.
-Yeah. Exactly.

1006
00:48:01,068 --> 00:48:02,379
So here's what I'm thinking.

1007
00:48:02,482 --> 00:48:03,689
DEE:
At this point in the game,

1008
00:48:03,793 --> 00:48:05,344
Drew needs to go.

1009
00:48:05,448 --> 00:48:07,965
Drew is the mastermind behind
a lot of moves in this game.

1010
00:48:08,068 --> 00:48:09,482
-Ooh, he's very smart, though.
-I know.

1011
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:11,206
-We got to be careful. He...
-He's extremely smart.

1012
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:13,379
And that's why I'm, like,
we have to be so good

1013
00:48:13,482 --> 00:48:16,000
-at making him believe
it's Julie.
-Yeah.

1014
00:48:16,103 --> 00:48:17,586
DEE:
I think the fact that I voted

1015
00:48:17,689 --> 00:48:19,620
for Julie last Tribal Council--

1016
00:48:19,724 --> 00:48:23,034
thank friggin' God that
I did that because it showed

1017
00:48:23,137 --> 00:48:25,206
that I was still with them
in this game.

1018
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:27,931
Drew trusts me right now
and he won't see it coming.

1019
00:48:28,034 --> 00:48:30,862
However, then that puts me
in a position where Austin might

1020
00:48:30,965 --> 00:48:32,896
feel like I betrayed him.

1021
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,103
It's gonna suck because I'm
worried about lying to Austin.

1022
00:48:36,206 --> 00:48:38,310
But when it comes
to lying to Drew,

1023
00:48:38,413 --> 00:48:40,827
I could care less.
[laughs]

1024
00:48:41,827 --> 00:48:43,413
DEE: It's crazy.

1025
00:48:43,517 --> 00:48:45,034
I know. It's right there.

1026
00:48:45,137 --> 00:48:46,482
-It's in our hands.
-It's right there.

1027
00:48:46,586 --> 00:48:48,517
DREW: Up to pretty much today,

1028
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,620
everything has gone to plan,

1029
00:48:50,724 --> 00:48:52,034
and that's an amazing thing,

1030
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,655
because it really doesn't
happen in Survivor.

1031
00:48:53,758 --> 00:48:56,586
You know, maybe I'm full of
hot air on this accomplishment,

1032
00:48:56,689 --> 00:48:58,896
but I really did
control the merge to this point.

1033
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,379
The only true hiccup
was Julie's idol play.

1034
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:05,241
But even that-- there was
some convenience for that.

1035
00:49:05,344 --> 00:49:07,931
Emily got out of the way
with no blood on my hands.

1036
00:49:08,034 --> 00:49:10,655
And I think that
with Julie headed home tonight,

1037
00:49:10,758 --> 00:49:14,344
I'm cruising into probably
a cleaner final five

1038
00:49:14,448 --> 00:49:17,206
than I would have if Julie had
gone home in the first place.

1039
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:19,241
My thought is that tonight,

1040
00:49:19,344 --> 00:49:21,620
she's gonna try and, like, spike
somebody's name out there,

1041
00:49:21,724 --> 00:49:23,413
and it probably will be me.

1042
00:49:23,517 --> 00:49:26,413
-But Austin could also play
his amulet on me.
-Yeah. Okay.

1043
00:49:26,517 --> 00:49:27,931
So we're set.
This is the plan.

1044
00:49:28,034 --> 00:49:29,379
-I'm locked in.
-Chill.

1045
00:49:29,482 --> 00:49:30,551
DREW:
I do think that

1046
00:49:30,655 --> 00:49:32,275
if I was really in danger,

1047
00:49:32,379 --> 00:49:34,827
Austin would play that amulet
on me and he would protect me.

1048
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:37,655
And maybe that is tremendous
complacency on my part,

1049
00:49:37,758 --> 00:49:41,517
but I do think that he's sincere
wanting to go to the end with me

1050
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:44,551
and that he would protect me
if push came to shove.

1051
00:49:44,655 --> 00:49:47,724
-It's not over yet,
but, I mean...
-It's looking promising.

1052
00:49:47,827 --> 00:49:49,965
AUSTIN:
It almost feels like
it's been too easy, you know?

1053
00:49:50,068 --> 00:49:52,034
It was, like, day two,
I was with Drew,

1054
00:49:52,137 --> 00:49:54,586
and we kind of had been talking
about working together,

1055
00:49:54,689 --> 00:49:57,793
and, you know, by day seven,
we had this final two alliance,

1056
00:49:57,896 --> 00:49:59,517
and we knew
we can take over this game.

1057
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:02,344
And we figured out a way
as soon as the merge hit

1058
00:50:02,448 --> 00:50:05,000
how we can knock each person out
to finish this game,

1059
00:50:05,103 --> 00:50:06,620
and we've been able
to get it done.

1060
00:50:06,724 --> 00:50:09,827
We have not had any single
breach of trust,

1061
00:50:09,931 --> 00:50:11,586
-Nope. Never.
-ever, which is crazy.

1062
00:50:11,689 --> 00:50:13,344
This could go down
as the greatest duo

1063
00:50:13,448 --> 00:50:14,586
-in Survivorhistory.
-It could go down
as an all-time.

1064
00:50:14,689 --> 00:50:15,655
I think it's an all-time.

1065
00:50:15,758 --> 00:50:17,206
-I do too.
-It's just cool.

1066
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:19,241
Oh, I love it.

1067
00:50:19,344 --> 00:50:21,241
DREW:
If you look at the greats,
you look at J.T. and Stephen,

1068
00:50:21,344 --> 00:50:23,241
you look at Gervase and Tyson,

1069
00:50:23,344 --> 00:50:25,241
when things came down to it,
especially,

1070
00:50:25,344 --> 00:50:26,827
you know,
at this point in the game,

1071
00:50:26,931 --> 00:50:28,413
they had each other's backs.

1072
00:50:28,517 --> 00:50:31,241
Now I'm seeing visions
of me at the final three.

1073
00:50:31,344 --> 00:50:33,206
Maybe I'm counting my chickens
before they hatch,

1074
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:35,448
but at the same time,
how could you not?

1075
00:50:35,551 --> 00:50:37,137
It all seems so tangible.

1076
00:50:37,241 --> 00:50:38,689
Just staying in the moment--
it's hard.

1077
00:50:38,793 --> 00:50:41,827
I'm speeding ahead,
but I have to stay grounded

1078
00:50:41,931 --> 00:50:43,241
in this vote tonight.

1079
00:50:43,344 --> 00:50:46,000
Otherwise, I might find myself
on the way out.

1080
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,931
That sucks, lying to Julie,
but at the same time, it's part

1081
00:50:51,034 --> 00:50:53,275
of the game,
but we're so freaking close.

1082
00:50:53,379 --> 00:50:55,448
-No, we're so close.
-I know.

1083
00:50:55,551 --> 00:50:58,068
I'm so happy you lost.
[laughs]

1084
00:50:59,137 --> 00:51:01,275
You're not gonna
let me forget that, are you?

1085
00:51:01,379 --> 00:51:02,862
Never. Never.

1086
00:51:02,965 --> 00:51:05,034
I'm going back and forth

1087
00:51:05,137 --> 00:51:07,413
with whether I should
or should not tell Austin

1088
00:51:07,517 --> 00:51:09,000
about blindsiding Drew.

1089
00:51:09,103 --> 00:51:12,206
He trusted me so much
to come and tell me about Julie

1090
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:14,482
because he didn't
want to blindside me.

1091
00:51:14,586 --> 00:51:16,862
So I feel like I don't want
to blindside him either.

1092
00:51:16,965 --> 00:51:18,896
But there is a possibility

1093
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,103
that he might
use his amulet on Drew

1094
00:51:21,206 --> 00:51:22,655
and then blindside Julie.

1095
00:51:22,758 --> 00:51:25,896
It would basically be the
same situation that I was in.

1096
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,103
Um, you know, so...

1097
00:51:29,793 --> 00:51:31,655
I don't know.
It's getting tough.

1098
00:51:31,758 --> 00:51:33,758
Like, this... Oh, man.

1099
00:51:34,793 --> 00:51:37,103
I mean, it's kind of crazy,
you know?

1100
00:51:37,206 --> 00:51:39,482
I think after tonight,
we're gonna have to have a...

1101
00:51:39,586 --> 00:51:41,517
-Heart-to-heart?
-Heart-to-heart, long hangout

1102
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,586
-I agree.
-at the beach.

1103
00:51:43,689 --> 00:51:46,655
-Well, let's do it.
-But, uh, I mean, at that point,

1104
00:51:46,758 --> 00:51:48,896
-it's game over.
-Yep.

1105
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,965
It is hard because, like,

1106
00:51:51,068 --> 00:51:53,758
my morals are coming in the way,
you know?

1107
00:51:53,862 --> 00:51:56,827
And... But then, I also told
myself, coming in here like,

1108
00:51:56,931 --> 00:51:59,206
"Dee, you cannot let
your emotions get in the way."

1109
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:01,000
Who are you voting for tonight?
Are you...

1110
00:52:01,103 --> 00:52:02,586
DEE:
I don't know.

1111
00:52:02,689 --> 00:52:06,000
Should I tell Austin
or should I not tell Austin?

1112
00:52:08,172 --> 00:52:12,344
Out here, you're forced
to make tough decisions.

1113
00:52:12,448 --> 00:52:14,862
And I told myself,
coming in here,

1114
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,310
I made a promise to myself.

1115
00:52:16,413 --> 00:52:18,137
I knew what was gonna
be my weakness. I knew it.

1116
00:52:18,241 --> 00:52:19,965
I didn't know who was gonna
be in this game,

1117
00:52:20,068 --> 00:52:21,655
I didn't know
who I was gonna meet,

1118
00:52:21,758 --> 00:52:24,689
but I knew that my weakness was
my emotions getting involved.

1119
00:52:24,793 --> 00:52:27,620
And trying to balance my morals
in the real world

1120
00:52:27,724 --> 00:52:29,827
with my morals onSurvivor...

1121
00:52:29,931 --> 00:52:32,310
[sighs]
It's hard. It's hard.

1122
00:53:02,724 --> 00:53:04,482
All right.

1123
00:53:04,586 --> 00:53:06,275
[Survivors laughing]

1124
00:53:06,379 --> 00:53:09,482
Let's start with
the reward challenge. Austin,

1125
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:12,068
you won that.
Came with a big reward.

1126
00:53:12,172 --> 00:53:15,931
A helicopter trip to a sandspit,
a nice picnic.

1127
00:53:16,034 --> 00:53:18,551
One of the things that I noticed
is when I asked you

1128
00:53:18,655 --> 00:53:20,551
who you were
gonna bring with you,

1129
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:22,482
first, you chose Dee.

1130
00:53:22,586 --> 00:53:25,793
But with your second choice,
you said, "Now it's about

1131
00:53:25,896 --> 00:53:28,620
"who I leave behind
to kind of look out,

1132
00:53:28,724 --> 00:53:30,517
make sure nothing happens."

1133
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:32,689
Did you get any kickback
from people

1134
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:35,448
saying, "What does that mean--
you don't trust us?"

1135
00:53:35,551 --> 00:53:37,137
AUSTIN:
A little bit.
You know, not too much.

1136
00:53:37,241 --> 00:53:39,689
But, you know,
the helicopter went

1137
00:53:39,793 --> 00:53:41,862
in front of the camp,
we all screamed.

1138
00:53:41,965 --> 00:53:44,379
So, like, I'm just thinking,
"Oh, my gosh.

1139
00:53:44,482 --> 00:53:46,103
If they didn't already hate me,
they're gonna hate me now."

1140
00:53:46,206 --> 00:53:48,517
But people were
really respectful

1141
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:49,793
of the decision, and, uh,

1142
00:53:49,896 --> 00:53:51,413
you know, that's
all I could ask for.

1143
00:53:51,517 --> 00:53:53,068
PROBST:
Julie, what's your take on this?

1144
00:53:53,172 --> 00:53:55,448
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
he just wanted me

1145
00:53:55,551 --> 00:53:57,862
to keep an eye on Drew and Jake.

1146
00:53:57,965 --> 00:53:59,103
No. No.

1147
00:53:59,206 --> 00:54:01,896
So, my suspicion is

1148
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,620
-I was to be babysat.
-PROBST: But you're the mom.

1149
00:54:04,724 --> 00:54:06,275
-You're the one who babysits.
-JULIE: Right?

1150
00:54:06,379 --> 00:54:09,310
-My kids are turning
on me, Jeff.
-[laughing]

1151
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:11,344
JAKE:
Well, you know,
we let Julie stay up late.

1152
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:13,827
We let her eat ice cream
past bedtime.

1153
00:54:13,931 --> 00:54:15,275
And you know, she was, uh...
I thought

1154
00:54:15,379 --> 00:54:16,862
-she had a fun time. Yeah.
-Got to jump on the bed.

1155
00:54:16,965 --> 00:54:18,793
-You know what I mean? Like...
-We were cool babysitters.

1156
00:54:18,896 --> 00:54:20,241
-Yeah, we were cool babysitters.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1157
00:54:20,344 --> 00:54:22,896
PROBST:
Katurah, we just
literally talked about

1158
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,551
Austin making a strategic move,

1159
00:54:24,655 --> 00:54:28,206
and it's one big joke,
but it's not a joke.

1160
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:31,241
That's a move
in a million-dollar game.

1161
00:54:31,344 --> 00:54:33,034
I think that
we're trying to separate

1162
00:54:33,137 --> 00:54:34,724
as best as we can, Jeff.

1163
00:54:34,827 --> 00:54:36,724
Yes, we recognize
this is a game

1164
00:54:36,827 --> 00:54:38,517
and there are gonna
be tough moves

1165
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:42,172
that must be made, no matter
how difficult they are.

1166
00:54:42,275 --> 00:54:44,689
But at the same time,
we really like each other.

1167
00:54:44,793 --> 00:54:47,241
We enjoy each other's company.
I mean, dare I even say

1168
00:54:47,344 --> 00:54:49,517
we throw the word "love" out
around here.

1169
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:53,241
PROBST:
So then, Drew,
how do you separate

1170
00:54:53,344 --> 00:54:56,275
voting somebody out
but spending all day with them,

1171
00:54:56,379 --> 00:54:57,620
being friendly?

1172
00:54:57,724 --> 00:54:59,620
So, the separation
is a complicated task--

1173
00:54:59,724 --> 00:55:01,034
and I'll be blunt--
that some people can do it

1174
00:55:01,137 --> 00:55:02,413
and other people can't.

1175
00:55:02,517 --> 00:55:04,103
Uh, and it's to different
degrees for everybody.

1176
00:55:04,206 --> 00:55:06,482
-PROBST: Which one are you?
-DREW: At first,

1177
00:55:06,586 --> 00:55:08,206
I was really caught up
in the relationships, and now,

1178
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:10,655
as we get closer to the end,
I start to get a clearer vision

1179
00:55:10,758 --> 00:55:12,620
for that, you know,
million-dollar check,

1180
00:55:12,724 --> 00:55:15,034
and I'm sure that a lot of us
are starting to feel that way.

1181
00:55:15,137 --> 00:55:17,103
I know Julie is. You know,
I know some other people are.

1182
00:55:17,206 --> 00:55:20,724
All of us have families at home,
we have friends.

1183
00:55:20,827 --> 00:55:22,793
A million dollars
is going to mean the world,

1184
00:55:22,896 --> 00:55:24,862
not just in my life,
but in their lives, as well.

1185
00:55:24,965 --> 00:55:27,344
And that brings you back
to reality pretty quickly.

1186
00:55:27,448 --> 00:55:32,241
Dee, how do these relationships
complicate a vote so much?

1187
00:55:32,344 --> 00:55:33,931
Oh, man.

1188
00:55:34,034 --> 00:55:35,862
Honestly, like, I think

1189
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:38,103
we all respect each other enough
to know that

1190
00:55:38,206 --> 00:55:40,068
we enjoy each other's company,
but at the same time,

1191
00:55:40,172 --> 00:55:42,000
we know we're all
lying to each other,

1192
00:55:42,103 --> 00:55:44,517
and someone's gonna
go home tonight

1193
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:45,965
and everyone knows
except that person.

1194
00:55:46,068 --> 00:55:48,862
PROBST:
So does that mean that alliances

1195
00:55:48,965 --> 00:55:51,896
are locked in and you're lying
to who you're lying to

1196
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,620
or does that mean the opposite:

1197
00:55:53,724 --> 00:55:55,137
that alliances
are not locked in?

1198
00:55:55,241 --> 00:55:57,413
That's why everybody's
lying to everybody.

1199
00:55:57,517 --> 00:55:59,413
Yeah. I think it's more

1200
00:55:59,517 --> 00:56:01,275
that alliances are not locked in
at this point.

1201
00:56:01,379 --> 00:56:04,172
We're getting to the stage
that you're starting to think of

1202
00:56:04,275 --> 00:56:06,758
the game versus
your personal relationships.

1203
00:56:06,862 --> 00:56:09,000
That's just the way it is
and we all accept it.

1204
00:56:09,103 --> 00:56:12,172
Drew, do you agree
alliances are not locked in?

1205
00:56:12,275 --> 00:56:14,275
Maybe I'm
the country bumpkin here,

1206
00:56:14,379 --> 00:56:15,413
but I feel like there are people

1207
00:56:15,517 --> 00:56:17,275
out here
who I'm 100% honest with.

1208
00:56:17,379 --> 00:56:19,689
I feel like I have alliances
I've locked in.

1209
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:22,862
PROBST:
Drew, that's a very
confident statement.

1210
00:56:22,965 --> 00:56:24,379
So then, do you feel

1211
00:56:24,482 --> 00:56:26,758
like you're able
to look a little further ahead,

1212
00:56:26,862 --> 00:56:28,724
or is everything about tonight?

1213
00:56:30,586 --> 00:56:32,517
Um...

1214
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:34,482
I think
if I get through tonight,

1215
00:56:34,586 --> 00:56:36,724
I have a clear vision
to the end.

1216
00:56:37,689 --> 00:56:39,172
Wow.

1217
00:56:39,275 --> 00:56:42,000
-Julie, that's a big statement.
-JULIE: Yeah.

1218
00:56:42,103 --> 00:56:43,482
PROBST:
Drew's saying,
"I get through tonight,

1219
00:56:43,586 --> 00:56:45,137
I see the end."

1220
00:56:45,241 --> 00:56:46,482
I'm jealous.

1221
00:56:46,586 --> 00:56:48,862
I-I'm in a different spot.

1222
00:56:48,965 --> 00:56:52,000
I mean, I'm in final six
and I might not make final five.

1223
00:56:52,103 --> 00:56:53,275
I hope I do.

1224
00:56:53,379 --> 00:56:56,172
But if I let my mind
go to final three,

1225
00:56:56,275 --> 00:56:58,482
I feel like I might lose focus
on just getting there.

1226
00:56:58,586 --> 00:57:00,344
PROBST:
Drew, it's really interesting
hearing that,

1227
00:57:00,448 --> 00:57:03,896
because if you survive tonight,
you just need to survive

1228
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,275
one more Tribal,
and no one can vote you out.

1229
00:57:06,379 --> 00:57:10,000
And yet Julie can't even
see that far ahead.

1230
00:57:10,103 --> 00:57:12,103
That's how big the game
feels right now.

1231
00:57:12,206 --> 00:57:13,758
Yeah, I mean, there's a sense

1232
00:57:13,862 --> 00:57:15,724
in which Survivor
is like limbo, and the bar

1233
00:57:15,827 --> 00:57:17,758
is a different height
for everybody at every vote.

1234
00:57:17,862 --> 00:57:19,758
And so, we obviously could tell

1235
00:57:19,862 --> 00:57:21,344
Julie's feeling
the squeeze here,

1236
00:57:21,448 --> 00:57:23,758
and she's feeling like the bar
is so low that she'd have to

1237
00:57:23,862 --> 00:57:25,827
get on her hands and knees
just to see under it

1238
00:57:25,931 --> 00:57:27,896
-past this vote.
-PROBST: Julie.

1239
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,965
Drew was very clear

1240
00:57:30,068 --> 00:57:32,034
-with his beautiful analogy
-JULIE: Yes. Yes.

1241
00:57:32,137 --> 00:57:34,137
that for you today,
limbo's difficult

1242
00:57:34,241 --> 00:57:36,586
-'cause the bar
is way down here.
-Right? Right?

1243
00:57:36,689 --> 00:57:37,965
And I'm hoping
that's not the case.

1244
00:57:38,068 --> 00:57:39,965
-Drew clearly thinks it is.
-JULIE: Right.

1245
00:57:40,068 --> 00:57:43,517
So I got to go into trust mode.
I have to.

1246
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:46,034
It's almost like
that first day of high school

1247
00:57:46,137 --> 00:57:49,517
that you're hoping
your middle school friends

1248
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:52,448
will be there for you or your
summer camp friends will be.

1249
00:57:52,551 --> 00:57:54,620
So I'm hopeful, but, like,

1250
00:57:54,724 --> 00:57:57,793
there's-there's bigger threats
than me.

1251
00:57:57,896 --> 00:57:59,724
I'm like, are you kidding me?
Like,

1252
00:57:59,827 --> 00:58:01,689
there-there's better play
out there.

1253
00:58:01,793 --> 00:58:04,896
There's got to be.
So that's kind of my plea.

1254
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,931
Austin, what do you make
of Drew's analogy?

1255
00:58:07,034 --> 00:58:08,482
AUSTIN:
Yeah, I think
he's absolutely spot on.

1256
00:58:08,586 --> 00:58:11,517
Like, when you're worried
about where you are

1257
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:14,517
in a given Tribal Council,
it's impossible to really think

1258
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,758
far ahead, because you're just
trying to survive that one.

1259
00:58:16,862 --> 00:58:18,931
And once you do that, then
maybe things start opening up.

1260
00:58:19,034 --> 00:58:21,000
Whereas for Dee, obviously,

1261
00:58:21,103 --> 00:58:22,931
it's much, much,
much easier for her

1262
00:58:23,034 --> 00:58:24,620
to see,
"Okay, one more and I'm four,

1263
00:58:24,724 --> 00:58:26,586
and then that means
I'm very close to three."

1264
00:58:26,689 --> 00:58:28,206
So, 100%.

1265
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:31,482
-Just another
solid analogy by Drew.
-[laughing]

1266
00:58:31,586 --> 00:58:35,172
Jake, Julie talks about
having a hard time seeing

1267
00:58:35,275 --> 00:58:37,655
past this vote.
How about you?

1268
00:58:37,758 --> 00:58:39,551
JAKE:
I mean, in this game,
you got to fight.

1269
00:58:39,655 --> 00:58:41,551
And I sympathize with Julie

1270
00:58:41,655 --> 00:58:43,034
'cause, you know,
I've been in that spot.

1271
00:58:43,137 --> 00:58:44,448
That's a tough spot to be in.

1272
00:58:44,551 --> 00:58:45,965
But look, Jeff,

1273
00:58:46,068 --> 00:58:47,724
the game is in overdrive
right now.

1274
00:58:47,827 --> 00:58:50,034
Like, we're looking at the end,
we're looking at each other

1275
00:58:50,137 --> 00:58:52,103
thinking like,
"All right, three people

1276
00:58:52,206 --> 00:58:53,586
"are gonna be on the jury.

1277
00:58:53,689 --> 00:58:55,448
"Three people are gonna
be sitting in final three.

1278
00:58:55,551 --> 00:58:57,482
How do we want that
to play out?"

1279
00:58:57,586 --> 00:58:59,586
Dee, has everybody
got their final three?

1280
00:59:00,655 --> 00:59:03,172
I think everyone
has their final three, yes.

1281
00:59:03,275 --> 00:59:05,448
However, I don't think
that the final three

1282
00:59:05,551 --> 00:59:07,827
that we all have in mind--
even my own--

1283
00:59:07,931 --> 00:59:09,586
will play out like that.

1284
00:59:09,689 --> 00:59:11,103
So you got to be prepared

1285
00:59:11,206 --> 00:59:13,620
for multiple options, for sure.

1286
00:59:13,724 --> 00:59:15,551
PROBST:
All right,

1287
00:59:15,655 --> 00:59:19,206
it is time to vote.
Katurah, you're up.

1288
00:59:35,206 --> 00:59:37,931
Can't go to the end against Mom.

1289
01:00:05,655 --> 01:00:07,068
I'll go tally the votes.

1290
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:23,586
If anybody has an advantage

1291
01:00:23,689 --> 01:00:25,620
or an idol
and you want to play it,

1292
01:00:25,724 --> 01:00:27,896
now would be the time to do so.

1293
01:00:38,068 --> 01:00:40,172
AUSTIN:
Yep.

1294
01:00:42,413 --> 01:00:45,689
Uh, this is an amulet that I got
when I was on a journey

1295
01:00:45,793 --> 01:00:49,931
with, uh, Kellie and, uh, J.

1296
01:00:50,034 --> 01:00:53,517
It started as a three-way
shared extra vote.

1297
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:55,206
Now it's an immunity idol, but

1298
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:58,413
I don't think I need any, uh,

1299
01:00:58,517 --> 01:01:00,241
souvenirs, so...

1300
01:01:00,344 --> 01:01:02,000
PROBST:
Playing this for yourself?

1301
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,965
AUSTIN:
Um...

1302
01:01:06,068 --> 01:01:08,068
gonna play it on myself.

1303
01:01:08,172 --> 01:01:10,034
PROBST:
Okay.

1304
01:01:13,413 --> 01:01:15,586
This is a hidden immunity idol.

1305
01:01:15,689 --> 01:01:18,655
Any votes cast
for Austin will not count.

1306
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:20,344
I'll read the votes.

1307
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:28,241
First vote: Julie.

1308
01:01:30,068 --> 01:01:33,137
Julie.
Two votes Julie.

1309
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:41,068
Drew.

1310
01:01:41,172 --> 01:01:42,724
Two votes Julie,

1311
01:01:42,827 --> 01:01:44,620
one vote Drew.

1312
01:01:46,344 --> 01:01:47,689
Drew.

1313
01:01:47,793 --> 01:01:49,551
We're tied. Two votes Julie,

1314
01:01:49,655 --> 01:01:50,689
two votes Drew.

1315
01:01:53,827 --> 01:01:55,103
Drew.

1316
01:01:55,206 --> 01:01:58,034
That's three votes Drew,
two votes Julie.

1317
01:02:04,379 --> 01:02:08,000
Thirteenth person voted out and
the sixth member of our jury.

1318
01:02:10,448 --> 01:02:12,551
Drew, need
to bring me your torch.

1319
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:31,172
Drew, the tribe has spoken.

1320
01:02:33,172 --> 01:02:34,931
See you, Drew.

1321
01:02:35,034 --> 01:02:37,000
Time for you to go.

1322
01:02:47,862 --> 01:02:50,965
Congratulations on making it
to the final five.

1323
01:02:51,068 --> 01:02:53,655
Tonight, you will not be
returning to your camp.

1324
01:02:53,758 --> 01:02:57,103
You will be taken to a new
island where you will start over

1325
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:59,931
and begin the final 
push to the end

1326
01:03:00,034 --> 01:03:02,310
of Survivor 45.

1327
01:03:02,413 --> 01:03:03,827
Good luck.
Grab your torches.

1328
01:03:03,931 --> 01:03:05,758
Good night.

01:03:34,413 --> 01:03:37,965
PROBST: Next time on the
season finale ofSurvivor...

1335
01:03:38,068 --> 01:03:39,931
DEE:
I'm literally unleashing myself.

1336
01:03:40,034 --> 01:03:41,344
My family's waiting for me

1337
01:03:41,448 --> 01:03:42,517
to come home
and tell them that I won.

1338
01:03:44,586 --> 01:03:46,931
JULIE:
I'm putting destiny
back in my hands.

1339
01:03:47,034 --> 01:03:48,965
PROBST:
Nothing about Survivoris easy!

1340
01:03:49,068 --> 01:03:51,275
KATURAH:
I'm at the finish line.
I can see it.

1341
01:03:51,379 --> 01:03:53,517
AUSTIN:
I need to make one final push.

1342
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:56,551
We are in the endgame.

1343
01:04:01,551 --> 01:04:03,068
Oh, man.
I got totally blindsided.

1344
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:05,275
It's a tragic, time-old story
of a young guy

1345
01:04:05,379 --> 01:04:07,448
who goes intoSurvivor
with a lot of brainpower

1346
01:04:07,551 --> 01:04:09,275
and a little bit
of too much confidence.

1347
01:04:09,379 --> 01:04:10,793
I'd love to tell you that, like,

1348
01:04:10,896 --> 01:04:12,758
Survivor
totally transformed me,

1349
01:04:12,862 --> 01:04:16,206
but it's a deeply ambiguous
experience that breaks you down,

1350
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:18,310
and I'm hopeful that I'll be
given the opportunity

1351
01:04:18,413 --> 01:04:19,931
to grow, building off this.

1352
01:04:20,034 --> 01:04:21,758
