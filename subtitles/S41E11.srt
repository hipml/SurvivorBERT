why is it
that every time I do something,

38
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,099
it's on the front page
of the freaking newspaper,

39
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,934

a little... a little bomb

43
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,311
on the group,

44
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,714
Ricard, you have my vote
for a million dollars.

45
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,116
Deshawn, you're a snake.

46
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,652
<i>DESHAWN:</i>
<i>So I was kind of pissed</i>

49
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,789
And you backstabbed her
as well,

50
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,091
but she didn't call you a snake.

51
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:40,894
She said, "Ricard,
you get a million dollars,

52
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,563
"even though you were my ally
and you orchestrated this,

54
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,133
Like, huh?

55
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,335
RICARD:
From where I'm standing,
Shan and I--

56
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:50,837
we knew we were gunning
for each other.

57
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:54,107
-Mm.
-Like, we had such
a honest relationship

58
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,642
and conversation about that.

59
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,845
And I think the fact
that there was the plan

60
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,347
to get me out today--
I think she knows

61
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,183
that that is what rushed me
to get rid of her.

62
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,085
Because clearly,
everybody wanted us separate,

63
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:07,520
so it had to happen.

64
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,822
Like, that's the only way
for me to save my game.

65
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,824
Because if I did not
win immunity today,

66
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,693
-I would be gone.
-Yeah.

67
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,628
<i>RICARD: As Shan left</i>
<i>after being voted out,</i>

knowing that I planned it,

69
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,633
you know, participated in it,
she must know.

70
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,802

<i>I have her vote</i>
<i>for a million dollars,</i>

72

73
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:31,878
<i>And so, he's taking a lot of</i>
<i>heat off of me, which is great.</i>

74
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,813
DESHAWN:
And it's like I'm fighting
every day for my life

75
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,915
for things that I am not doing
in this game,

76
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,550
and it's freaking
irritating, dude.

77
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,852
Like, I voted out Shan
because she told me

78
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,087
that she was gunning for me.
That's it.

79
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,622
Now I'm the snake. Yeah.

80
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,725

83
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,466

to deal with being a snake.

86
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:04,177

Shan's at fault

87
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:06,512
for calling him a snake
and ruining his game.

88
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,481

<i>of the fact</i>

89
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:09,782
<i>that he's all over the place,</i>

90
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,951
<i>can't commit to any one person,</i>

91

It's coming off very, very
paranoid, and I think the...

94
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,836
I really think the thing that
can help you is to chill out.

95
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,638
If it sounded
like I was, like, coming at you

96
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:34,607
or ranting at you,
I actually was not angry at you.

97
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:37,977
I was trying to process, like,
why did she only call me a snake

98
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,612
when there was,
like, two other people

99
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:43,082
who also wrote her name down
that she was really close with?

100
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,917
You know,
it just didn't make sense,

101
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:46,285
so I was just trying
to process it.

A lot of things
happening at once,

103
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,255
but this is where I'm at
right now, so...

104
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,923
<i>I thought</i>
<i>that if I came back to camp</i>

105
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,227
<i>and I basically exposed Ricard</i>
<i>for his move,</i>

106
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:56,529
that the group would want
to take him out next.

107
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,197
The issue is, though,

108
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,633
that I guess I came off
a little bit accusatory,

109
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,869
<i>and it just didn't end up</i>
<i>working out.</i>

110
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,103
But thank you for that advice.

117
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,317
but if I can
change the hands of time,

118
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:19,585

just not say anything.

<i>it makes sense to get rid of her</i>

463
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:19,471
<i>because she's someone who voted</i>
<i>for me the last Tribal Council</i>

464

like, any allegiance to me

He's out...

500
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,235
He wants Ricard.
Everybody... everybody

501
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,204
with a brain
between their ears wants Ricard.

502
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,572
-Thank you.
-And I'm wishing you
all the best, thousand percent.

503
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,274
Thank you, thank you.

really, life in this game

509
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,819
that people realize

510
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:15,353
<i>Ricard is a much bigger threat.</i>

511
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,390

<i>you're watching at home,</i>

"Oh, my God, it's so obvious.

518
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:36,775
You have to take the big threat
out of the game."

519
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:38,610
<i>But, like,</i>
<i>when you're in the game,</i>

520
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:42,314

PROBST:
All right, let's start
with today's immunity challenge.

528
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,400
Danny wins the necklace
for the first time.

529
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,403
You are safe tonight.
Today's challenge also came

530
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,006
with a twist
that if you were first out,

531
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,475
your fate would be determined
by a game of chance

532
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:45,944
in a new game
called<i> Survivor</i> Do or Die.

533
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,914
Deshawn, you were first out,
and in a few minutes

534
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,716
we're going to play Do or Die,
and that will determine

535
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,385
whether or not you live or die
and whether or not

536
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:54,753
we have a vote.

537
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,522
So before we get to that, Liana,

538
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,392
today's twist was all
about relationships.

539
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:03,595
If you didn't think you needed
immunity, you could sit out.

540
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,664
Yeah, Jeff,
I do not feel comfortable

541
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,198
in my-my relationships,
and I don't want

542
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:08,733
to give that impression at all.

543
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,236
The fact of the matter was,
in terms of Liana statistics

544
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,705
in individual immunity
challenges-- hasn't been so hot.

545
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,674
So that means in no way
that I'm comfortable tonight.

546
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,943
That was my argument, as well,
is the people

547
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:21,846
that I have outlasted in the
challenges were already gone.

548
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,215
And then, so it didn't
make sense for me

549
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:25,684
to stay there and risk that,

550
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,552
especially not knowing
what I'm risking.

551
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,688
PROBST:
And so, Xander,
there's always uncertainty,

552
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,824
but tonight
there truly is uncertainty.

553
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,359
We might not even
vote somebody out.

554
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,361
Deshawn might be
in the final six,

555
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,363
and we do vote somebody out.
We don't know.

556
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,365
I mean, you want to believe

557
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,268
that every Tribal is determined
simply by relationships.

558
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,303
But it's not only relationships

559
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,505
that you're worrying about now,
but about

560
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:50,442
this advantage
and this twist, and

561
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:52,477
I like that this season kind of

562
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:55,113
throws out all the expectations
we have of<i> Survivor.</i>

563
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,782
You know, now it's high-risk,
high-reward,

564
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,851
so you really have to gamble
a little bit.

565
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:02,120
PROBST:
Danny, how'd it feel for you

566
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,356
having certainty
with that necklace?

567
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,424
It felt pretty good, but, um,

568
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:08,994
Deshawn's my friend here.

569
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,030
The fact that he has no idea
what's gonna happen

570
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:13,331
with him tonight
is kind of crazy.

571
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:16,368
Um, we were trying
to figure out a plan,

572
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:19,304
and not really sure
we're gonna execute the plan.

573
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:22,407
But I'm more of the
"put your name on it," right?

574
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,809
If you're gonna put your plan
out there, go ahead and say that

575
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:26,778
you said it, and that's
what you wanted to do,

576
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:28,680
and you have
to face the consequences

577
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:30,882
-if it doesn't work out.
-PROBST: Erika, there's also

578
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:33,785
another factor tonight.
It's the last night

579
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,220
you can take
your Shot in the Dark.

580
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:37,022
One-in-six shot at safety.

581
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:40,125
ERIKA:
Yeah, I don't know what
the odds are for the Do or Die,

582
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:43,628
but if Deshawn,
like, doesn't die...

583
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,330
But I... I don't want you

584
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,865
-to, like,<i> die</i> die.
-Right, right.

585
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:49,901
ERIKA:
Um, and someone plays
the Shot in the Dark,

586
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:52,670
and someone else gets knocked
out, like, there's no certainty

587
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,472
for what's going
to happen tonight.

588
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:55,607
How's that feel?

589
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:57,175
Oh, it sucks.

590
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:00,145
Jeff, I-I have a love-hate
with this game.

591
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:02,047
Some days I love it,
some days I hate it.

592
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:04,282
Today I hate it.

593
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,617
That is a great answer to hear

594
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:08,053
because if-if the game
isn't doing that to you,

595
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,454
then it's not pushing you.

596
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,956
If this is the adventure
of a lifetime,

597
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,893
then you have to have that low
to have that high.

598
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,962
You have to have the anger
to feel the joy.

599
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,864
It's part of it.
So, Deshawn,

600
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:22,267
was it different for you because

601
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,536
you're the one that's going
to have to play Do or Die,

602
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:26,538
but you're still the one
hoping there is a vote,

603
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:29,340
-and you want it to go your way?
-Um, yeah, Jeff.

604
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,643
So if I can back it up
just a little bit

605
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,144
to my decision to actually play.

606
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:36,214
Um, after the Last Tribal
when Shan went home, um,

607
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:39,851
there was a bit of a discussion
between Ricard and I

608
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:43,388
just because, in this game,
morals and gameplay intersect,

609
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,990
and I felt very passionate
about the Shan vote

610
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:49,794
for a lot of different reasons,
and so I just wanted the truth.

611
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,896
And I think me confronting
Ricard made it seem like

612
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:53,798
I was some aggressive guy
that I'm not.

613
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,300
And I think that could have
put me in trouble.

614
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:57,102
So that's why I-I went ahead
and played.

615
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:59,170
PROBST:
Ricard, you obviously know

616
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,840
what Deshawn is referring to.
Do you want to elaborate?

617
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:05,210
Yeah, so...

618
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:06,978
there was a lot of talk

619
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,914
that I was the one who was going
to be voted out last time.

620
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:11,616
Um, I was told by Shan

621
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:15,153
that the plan was Deshawn's,
and so

622
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,322
we were going to try and flip
the vote and get Deshawn out.

623
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:18,690
And just to confirm, you said

624
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:20,258
that Shan told you that...
to vote me out, right?

625
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:21,693
She was the one that came up
with that plan?

626
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:27,198
Yes. And so our conversation
was him not fully knowing

627
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:30,001
if I was creating a lie
to divide them,

628
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:31,469
which I was not.

629
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,171
-Okay.
-And I stand by that.

630
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,806
I believe you.

631
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,942
PROBST:
And, Deshawn, for you,
why is it important?

632
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,711
When you talk
about your integrity,

633
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:41,479
what are you worried
about your integrity?

634
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,314
DESHAWN:
It's-it's hard, Jeff.
It's hard to put it into words.

635
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:45,316
I'm so passionate
about this game.

636
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:47,018
I'm passionate
about the decision

637
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,686
that we had to make
at the last Tribal,

638
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,421
and I don't know
what's gonna happen to me.

639
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:52,390
Um, but it's not even
about that.

640
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,592
You know, a lot of minority
players put in a lot of work

641
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,060
to diversify this cast.

642
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,396
And when I came into it,
I wanted to make sure

643
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,465
that I represented,
like, the Black community

644
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:03,835
as... as well as possible,
and so...

645
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,937
(cries softly)

646
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:15,446
And so it just hurt

647
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:17,482
to even have
to write her name down 'cause

648
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,952
that really is my sister,
but, like,

649
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:24,189
the gameplay and morals
intersected, and it was so hard.

650
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:25,390
(sighs)

651
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:28,092
You're all right, bro.

652
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,029
And it's hard, bro.
Like, it's really hard.

653
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:32,297
'Cause this is a game
that I love,

654
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:33,398
and I came here to play it.

655
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:35,900
But people don't understand

656
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,702
the extra baggage
that you bring into this game.

657
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:40,171
And it's a blessing
to have such a diverse cast,

658
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,373
but, like, I didn't think
this decision, this moment--

659
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,843
voting her out-- would be this
hard, so it's really tough.

660
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,346
(Deshawn sniffles)

661
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:49,647
I was just playing the game

662
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:50,782
with the information
that I was given,

663
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:52,850
and I had
to make that hard decision,

664
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,186
and it was the toughest thing
I've ever had to do.

665
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,922
So here I am.

666
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,557
(Deshawn sniffles)

667
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:03,194
PROBST:
Liana, do you feel that as well,

668
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,930
that you and Deshawn
and Shan and Danny

669
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,099
have this other thing

670
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,767
that really doesn't
have anything to do

671
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,936
with the gameplay,
but it has to do with

672
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,372
-where we are in the culture?
-LIANA: Absolutely.

673
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:20,478
Everywhere I go
as a Black woman,

674
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,213
I'm a Black woman first.

675
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,681
It doesn't matter that
I'm a student at Georgetown.

676
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:24,983
It doesn't matter

677
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,452
that I have this amazing
internship next summer.

678
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:30,388
When people look at me,
they see a Black woman,

679
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,890
and I take that with me
wherever I go.

680
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:35,727
And there is no question
that we're coming out of a year,

681
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:39,664
like 2020, where people are
just now becoming conscious

682
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,966
of the fact that being Black
actually means something.

683
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:45,536
It has this kind of currency
that can kill you,

684
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,071
literally kill you.

685
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:50,575
And doesn't mean that Black
death is like this new thing.

686
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,410
Like, Emmett Till happened
so many years ago,

687
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,045
and nobody really, like,
seemed to care then.

688
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,780
And now
it's become this thing, right?

689
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,249
And so, coming here
to play this is

690
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,251
about uplifting other Black
people and giving Black people

691
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,720
something to root for
besides everything else

692
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:04,088
that's out there
that's killing us.

693
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:05,890
And then, not only that.
How beautiful is it

694
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:07,859
that we're starting out
with a cast

695
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:09,794
with 50% POC, right?

696
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:12,130
There's another Black woman
right there that looks like me

697
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:13,831
who's also playing this game
with me.

698
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:15,700
Another piece of that is
that the fan base

699
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,402
that is watching this-- for them

700
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:19,771
to meet a Liana or a Shan

701
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:22,573
or a Danny or a Deshawn,
like, they get

702
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,942
to understand that Blackness
is not, you know, this monolith,

703
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,245
this one thing.
Like, we're all types of Black.

704
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:29,080
We're-we're Black
in different ways.

705
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:30,982
And to Deshawn's point,
it's, like,

706
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,051
we love this game, too.
We don't just want to have

707
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,186
this all-Black alliance and-and
throw strategy out the window.

708
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:36,854
Like, we want to play.
We want to, you know, like,

709
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:38,623
let's get Shan out
because she is a huge threat.

710
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,491
Like, we want to do both,
but how

711
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:41,993
do we do it at the same time?

712
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,995
And of course that's a factor

713
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:45,997
when we're playing this game.

714
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:50,902
Like, I'm Black wherever I go.
That's just it.

715
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:55,340
PROBST:
Danny,
it's a huge responsibility

716
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:58,409
inside a game that is
already impossible to play.

717
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,745
How are you managing with it?

718
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,281
Yeah, uh, I mean, it's a little
tough. I mean, like,

719
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,917
Liana said it perfectly,
and I understand Deshawn

720
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:07,285
and how he feels about it

721
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,654
because coming into the game,
it wasn't about

722
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,823
taking this, and
all Black people get to the end.

723
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:15,159
It was more about showing those
connections and that diversity.

724
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,161
And hopefully,
when people see that,

725
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:19,430
they'll be able to talk to each
other the same way that we are.

726
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,933
So, I just want to tell you that

727
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:24,435
I really appreciate
the explanation.

728
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,904
Uh, I think Shan and you
will be able

729
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,706
to have
a very in-depth conversation,

730
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:32,176
and-and maybe we all will, and
we can show that we'll be able

731
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:33,778
to kind of come
to understanding,

732
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,246
and move forward
from this, as well,

733
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,882
and I hope that's-that's
what happens from this.

734
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,917
PROBST:
Xander,

735
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:42,019
-what's the emotion?
-I mean,

736
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:44,455
I'm out here playing a game,
and-and then

737
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,925
you take it out, and you make it
this real-world thing,

738
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:50,094
and it's-it's so powerful.
I mean,

739
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:51,796
I don't represent a people.

740
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,831
I don't carry that burden
with me.

741
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:56,300
I don't think
about those kinds of things

742
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,102
because I-I have the privilege

743
00:33:58,169 --> 00:33:59,771
of not having
to think about that.

744
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:03,007
So I have so much respect
for the people out here

745
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,810
who are representing people
and trying to show

746
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,946
that there are positive ways to
be represented in the culture.

747
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:11,349
And that's powerful.
That goes beyond this game.

748
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:14,652
Jeff, and I... and I just want
to say I think that's

749
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,756
really important because the
main thing in the outside world

750
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:20,925
is to show that we have allies.

751
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:23,094
We have people
that-that care about

752
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,730
what's happening to us,
how we feel,

753
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,532
and the justice
that we want, and,

754
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:28,733
Xander, you're a part of that.

755
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,902
Like, I really respect you
as a man.

756
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:32,904
Same thing with everybody else
sitting up here,

757
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,405
and I really feel like,

758
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,607
back in the real world
when all this is over,

759
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:40,945
if we call on this cast to be
allies for any type of cause,

760
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:44,549
I feel like we have a-a
good group to help push that.

761
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:46,184
PROBST:
Heather,
what's your perspective

762
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,987
on what's happening right here
as a reflection of our culture?

763
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:53,891
We're growing, we're learning.

764
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:57,328
I had no idea that this was
a conflict that was going on,

765
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:58,830
and it breaks my heart to know

766
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:01,199
that you are carrying this
with you,

767
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,900
and it's something
I don't understand.

768
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:06,337
I'm grateful
that you shared this because

769
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:09,974
it just shows me
I have a lot more... to learn

770
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:13,077
and more questions to ask.

771
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:15,079
-Um, I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

772
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:18,149
Thank you for your words.
I appreciate it.

773
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,184
(sniffles)
We're all learning.
We're all growing.

774
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:21,686
Thank you, Heather.

775
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:23,855
LIANA:
And can I also
just add something?

776
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:26,357
I think, also, you know,
something hard perhaps

777
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:27,959
for-for viewers back home is,
like, you know,

778
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,394
"I-I just want to watch
<i>Survivor.</i> Like, why is this...

779
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,196
"you know, all this, like,
kind of real-life elements

780
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,632
"kind of have to jump
into the game

781
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:37,034
when it's suddenly super
diverse?" To those people,

782
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:39,804
I understand, but, you know,
it just means that

783
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,740
we're human beings, and the game
is a little bit more complex,

784
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,775
and we're a microcosm
of the real world, too.

785
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:48,179
So, I'm sorry if some people
feel that way from,

786
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:50,314
you know,
this kind of moment, but

787
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,650
that's... I think
that's important to note, too.

788
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:56,053
PROBST:
Well, I would just offer,
I'm sure

789
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,356
lots of people watch<i> Survivor</i>
for lots of different reasons.

790
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:00,925
To me, it's about this.

791
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,895
What happens
when you put a group of people

792
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:07,231
and force them to live together
in a jungle,

793
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:10,301
a real jungle,
and rely on each other?

794
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,137
It's amazing,
and there's no doubt in my mind

795
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,739
this is a special group

796
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:16,474
for all the reasons
you're talking about.

797
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:19,377
It's beautiful of you to share
it, and I think it's going to be

798
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,913
powerful for a lot of people
to hear it.

799
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,714
Thank you, guys.
Everybody.

800
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,616
-Thank you guys for the support.
-Thank you.

801
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:29,020
(sighs):
All right.

802
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,055
No, don't do it.

803
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,124
-Let's just talk
some more, Jeff.
-(laughter)

804

PROBST:
Before we get to the vote,

805
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,628
we have to see
if there is a vote.

806
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,363
It's the looming suspense

807
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:43,200
of<i> Survivor</i> Do or Die.
Let me get it set up.

808
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:47,371
Lord, have mercy. I'm sweating.

809
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:05,056

Inside one of these boxes
is a fire symbol.

819
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:29,847
That represents life.

820
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,215
That means you are safe,

821
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:32,483
guaranteed a spot
in the final six,

822
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,119
-and we vote somebody out.
-Okay.

823
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:37,989
Inside two of these boxes
is a skull symbol.

824
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:40,057
That represents death
in the game.

825
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:41,359
-Okay.
-And that means you are gone,

826
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,127

-Okay.

-Yes, sir.

828
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:49,166
Deshawn, choose one box.
