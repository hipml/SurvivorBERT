FROM TRIBAL COUNCIL.

102
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,613
IT JUST BECAME KIND OF TOO

103
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,614
POINTED AND PERSONAL FOR ME AND

104
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,239
I LITERALLY HAD TO WALK AWAY.

105
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,450
I HAVE TO GET A GRIP ON MY

106
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:20,700
EMOTIONS.

107
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:21,367

114
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,269
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT TO SOMEONE

115
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,480
SO TO HAVE SOMEONE DO IT TO ME,

116
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,814
MY BRAIN CAN'T PROCESS IT.

117
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:57,487
I'M LIKE, "OH, YOU'RE MEAN."

118
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,823
BUT IT'S ABOUT ME AND WHAT I

119
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,617
STAND FOR, AND IT DOESN'T REALLY

120
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,869
MATTER WHAT BRANDON THINKS OF

121
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:05,036

IT JUST DOESN'T.

123
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,622
BUT THAT'S REALLY DISAPPOINTING

124
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:08,790
BECAUSE IF HE TREATS OTHER

125
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:15,296
PEOPLE LIKE THAT, IT'S LIKE

126
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:26,307
POLLUTION.

127
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,811

00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,787
I'M SERIOUS.

138
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,289
I'M SO FREAKING PISSED OFF RIGHT

139
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:50,456

145
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,924
LIKE IT'S-- LIKE THE WAVE.

146
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,968
AND IT'S COMING BACK.

147
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,928
IT FEELS GREAT!

148
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,638
JUST IT WOULD BE REALLY FUN TO

00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,139
SCREW THINGS UP.

150
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:06,889

190
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:45,548
NOT REALLY A THREAT.

191
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,674
>> HALF THE DAY HE SLEEPS, AND

192
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:47,675
THE OTHER HALF HE SITS.

193
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:51,012
>> HONESTLY, HE IS SO LAZY.

194
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:51,637
IF WE WERE TO VOTE HIM OFF, I

195
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,098
DON'T THINK HE WOULD GUESS.

196
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:59,270
>> IT'S A GROUP JOKE, "WHERE IS

197
00:07:59,353 --> 00:07:59,520
SHAMAR?

198
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,480
20 BUCKS SAYS HE'S NAPPING."

199
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,732
SHAMAR HAS TO GO IF WE GO TO

200
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,608
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

201
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:07,403
IT'S NONNEGOTIABLE.

202
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:09,155
>> SO TONIGHT?

203
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:09,739
>> YEAH.

204
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,199
>> MIKE?

205
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:11,407
>> YEAH.

206
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,783
>> LAURA, JULIA.

207
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:13,034
>> OKAY.

208
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,243
>> AND THEN MATT.

209
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:14,493
>> YEAH.

210
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,245
>> I CAN TELL YOU NOW THAT THEY

211
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:16,704
WANT YOU WITH US.

212
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,080
>> OH, REALLY?

213
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,665
>> YEAH.

214
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,168
>> I'M GOOD.

215
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,127
I'M TOTALLY DOWN WITH THAT.

216
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,587
>> I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE SIX.

217
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,548
LAURA, JULIA, SHAMAR, MIKE, AND

218
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,090
MATT.

219
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,467
WE ARE SOLID.

220
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,052
THAT'S MY GANG.

221
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:35,640
AND SO IT'S US SIX AGAINST THE

222
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,433
FOUR-SOME, THE COUPLES, THE

223
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:38,226
LOVERS, THE WHATEVER YOU WANT TO

224
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,227
CALL THEM.

225
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,519
JUST KEEP TALKING AND RUNNING

226
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,646
YOUR MOUTH, WHICH YOU'RE GOOD

227
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,815
AT, BITCHING ABOUT WATER.

228
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,234
JUST KEEP DOING THAT.

229
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,610
DON'T GET PARANOID IF I'M NOT

230
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:48,569
STANDING BESIDE YOU OR HANGING

231
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,654
WITH YOU.

232
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,156
I'M NOT LETTING GO OF MY BOY

233
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,406
SHAMAR.

234
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,158
HE NEEDS TO BE RIGHT HERE IN MY

235
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:54,659
BACK POCKET.

236
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,245
I WANT SHAMAR TO KEEP ANNOYING

237
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:57,453
PEOPLE.

238
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,205
SHAMAR IS MY PHILLIP.

239
00:08:59,288 --> 00:08:59,747
SO I WANT TO KEEP MY PHIL

240
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,791
AROUND, AND I GET ALONG WITH MY

241
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:01,958
PHIL.

242
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,085
I CAN-- I CAN STROKE HIM AND I

243
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:07,380
CAN-- I CAN PUT HIM BACK IN

244
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:07,797
PLACE.

245
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,048
I'M TELLING YOU, WE NEED YOU.

246
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:09,757
>> OKAY.

247
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,092
>> WE WANT YOU ON OUR SIDE.

248
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:14,136
>> I LOVE YOU GUYS!

249
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:24,272
I LOVE YOU!

250
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,857
>> AFTER LAST NIGHT, IT MAKES ME

251
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,484
A LITTLE BIT FURTHER DOWN ON THE

252
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:28,818
TOTEM POLE.

253
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,194
>> RIGHT, WHAT I'M SAYING IS THE

254
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,570
MAIN FOCUS RIGHT NOW WE ALL

255
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,322
AGREE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE

256
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,284
BUILDING, LIKE, A UNANIMOUS

257
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:36,534
COHESION.

258
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,202
>> JUST KEEP THIS BETWEEN-- I

259
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,705
WAS PLANNING ON SABOTAGING

260
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:40,997
EVERYTHING.

261
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,957
>> BY DOING WHAT?

262
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,125
>> SPILLING BEANS?

263
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,918
LOSING CHALLENGES.

264
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,546
AND THEN BE LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT,

265
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,171
IF YOU THINK YOU CAN WIN THIS

266
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,299
WITHOUT ME, DO IT?

267
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,883
I WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND I WAS

268
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:53,634
LIKE,UN WHAT?

269
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,178
WHAT KIND OF PERSON WOULD I BE

270
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:56,429
KNOWN AS?

271
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,305
NOT A GOOD ONE.

272
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:57,555
>> RIGHT.

273
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,932
>> I WOULD BE KNOWN AS A

274
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:00,599
QUITTER.

275
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,934
AND THIS IS FOR MY KIDS.

276
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,311
THIS IS FOR MY CHILDREN.

277
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,937
I WAS LIKE THE BEST THING I CAN

278
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:05,688
DO IS TO BE NICE.

279
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:09,400
>> ONE OF THE MOST FRIGHTENING

280
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,693
THINGS ABOUT BRANDON'S

281
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,445
PERSONALITY IS HE HAS THESE

282
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:13,696
MOMENTS OF EXTREME RAGE AND

283
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,489
THEY'RE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY

284
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,825
FOLLOWED BY UNBELIEVABLY

285
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,660
PLEASANTNESS, SORT OF BEHAVIOR

286
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,371
FITTING A MURDERER WHO IS KIND

287
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:22,705
OF SOCIOPATHIC.

288
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,665
>> I LIKE OUR TRIBE, I REALLY

289
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:24,832
DO.

290
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,292
PHILLIP, YOU'RE NOT INTERRUPTING

291
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:26,542
NOTHING.

292
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:26,751
>> OKAY.

293
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,836
>> ONLY THING I CAN PREDICT

294
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:29,795
ABOUT BRANDON IS HE IS GOING TO

295
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,630
BE UNPREDICTABLE.

296
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,715
THAT GIVES ME VERY LITTLE SALOS

297
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,593
IN THIS GAME WHERE

298
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:36,302
PREDICTABILITY IS EVERYTHING.

299
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,136
>> WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WE WANT

300
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:40,639
TO BE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE, BUT

301
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,433
LIKE DIRECT A VOTE TOWARDS

302
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,517
SOMEBODY, NOT SO DIVIDED.

303
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,686
>> BOSTON ROB WOULD ALWAYS SAY

304
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,312
TO ME, "THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING

305
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:46,520
TO DO.

306
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,189
DISPIVMENT REALIZED HE DID THAT

307
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,900
TO MI MINIMIZE THE FLOW OF

308
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:51,192
INFORMATION.

309
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:54,153
>> DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU COULD

310
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,155
TRUST ME WITH THE FLOW OF

311
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:56,447
INFORMATION?

312
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,783
>> RIGHT NOW WHEN I GO, "HM,

313
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,202
TRUST OR NOT TRUST FULLY?

314
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,496
I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DATA YET."

315
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:03,871
I PAUSE.

316
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,664
I PAUSE WITH YOU.

317
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,208
A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE DO A GREAT

318
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,710
JOB AND WANT TO BE THE CEO OF A

319
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:10,336
COMPANY AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE

320
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,296
PATIENCE TO SAY YOU HAVE TOW

321
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,591
START AT A LOWER LEVEL, MIDDLE

322
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:16,092
MANAGEMENT, SO RIGHT NOW--

323
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,010
>> I'M IN MIDMANAGEMENT.

324
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,762
>> AND THE C.E.O. DON'T CALL IN

325
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,680
MIDMANAGEMENT UNLESS HE HAS

326
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,932
SOMETHING HE WANTS TO TELL HIM.

327
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:27,228
BRANDON, HE IS NARCISSISTIC.

328
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:30,773
AND YOU'RE DEAL WITH A

329
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:31,941
NARCISSISTIC PERSON THEY DON'T

330
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,776
HAVE EMPATHY FOR OTHER PEOPLE.

331
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,027
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THERE'S

332
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,196
SOMETHING VERY DISTURBING ABOUT

333
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,448
TO ME, I THINK-- I THINK SOMEONE

334
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,908
USED THE PHRASE FOR ME LAST

335
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:41,867
YEAR, CRAZY.

336
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,620
>> I'M GOING TO BE HONEST WITH

337
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,122
YOU, GUYS, PHILLIP IS PROBABLY

338
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,207
THE BIGGEST BULLY I HAVE EVER

339
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:48,582
MET IN MY LIFE.

340
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,625
>> WHAT?

341
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:54,547
>> HE'S MAKING ME REAL REALLY

342
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:54,880
UNCOMFORTABLE.

343
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,550
>> HE'S CALLING HIMSELF THE

344
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,301
C.E.O. OF THE TRIBE.

345
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,553
YOU CAN'T TRUST ME BECAUSE OF

346
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,888
LAST SEASON AND I HAVE A FEEL

347
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,557
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN.

348
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:04,932
I'M JUST SAYING.

349
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:08,185
YOU DON'T WANT TO FIGHT WITH ME!

350
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,855
SPECIAL AGENT PINK PANTHER WAS

351
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,023
FREAKING INSPECTOR GADGET

352
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,400
THOUGHT HE COULD PULL HIS

353
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,526
SPECIAL AGENT TRICK AND THAT IS

354
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:19,071
GOING TO BE THE DOWNED FALL IN

355
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,030
THIS GAME.

356
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:20,823
THE SIMPLE MATTER IS HE IS

357
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,908
TREATING PEOPLE LIKE GARBAGE.

358
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,453
HE IS STARTING TO "BOSTON ROB"

359
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,829
US A LITTLE BIT AND I DON'T LIKE

360
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:26,996
THAT.

361
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,748
YOU HAVE TO CUT THE HEAD OFF THE

362
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:29,957
SNAKE.

363
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,916
HE'S THE LEADER I'M NOT TRYING

364
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,083
TO--

365
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,586
>> LISTEN, HE'S NOT ANY KIND OF

366
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:33,836
LEADER.

367
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,962
>> WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT I

368
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,464
HAVE TO GIVE IT EVERYTHING I

369
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,756
HAVE THESE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.

370
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,175
IF I DON'T, I'M GONE.

371
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,093
>> I'VE BEEN IN THE OUTSIDE.

372
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,386
I FEEL LIKE THERE'S STILL ROOM

373
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,053
FOR EVERYBODY TO WORK.

374
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:46,724
THAT'S THE WAY THIS GAME GOES.

375

IT NEVER CROSSED MY MIND UNTIL I

732
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:33,573
LIVED WITH HIM.

733
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,033

RIGHT, WRONG, OR INDIFFERENT,

YOUR BEHAVIOR IS NOT ACCEPTABLE

739
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,250
FROM WHERE I COME FROM.

HE MADE A DRAMATIC SCENE.

749
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:56,846
IT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE, AND HE

750
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,433
DID IT IN FRONT FRONT OF

751
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,017
EVERYBODY, AND I FELT LIKE HE

752
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:01,643
KNOWS HIM AND THE THREE OTHER

753
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,104
PEOPLE IN HIS ALLIANCE ARE IN A

754
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,105
SHORT SITUATION SO HE TRIED TO

755
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:06,606
MAKE A SCENE TO MAKE ME LOOK BAD

756
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,692
SO PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO VOTE FOR

757
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,360
ME AND KEEP HIS ALLIANCE IN THE

758
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,237
GAME FOR ONE MORE CHALLENGE.

759
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,238
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING TO

760
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,864
ME ABOUT IT FOREVER?

761
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,574
LIKE YOU WEREN'T GOING TO VOTE

762
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,118
FOR ME BEFORE TODAY.

763
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:21,329
LIKE TODAY IS NOW, LIKE, VOTE

764
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,665
FOR SHAMAR KAY DAY.

765
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:27,168
DO I LOOK LIKE BOO-BOO THE FOOL.

766
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,211
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT ALL

767
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,754
ABOUT ME SO YOU CAN SWAY OTHER

768
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,131
PEOPLE'S OPINIONS BUT THAT'S ALL

769
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:31,631
GREAT, MAN.

770
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:32,590
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS TONIGHT.

771
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,676
>> I'M GOING TO GET THIS FIRE

772
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,093
GOING AGAIN.

773
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:38,680
>> IS IT OUT?

774
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,098
>> ENOUGH IS ENOUGH WITH THAT

775
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:40,265
GUY.

776
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:40,640
>> I KNOW.

777
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,560
>> HOLY MOLY.

778
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,769
>> GO TALK ABOUT IT.

779
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,062
( LAUGHS )

780
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,314
>> WE WILL, SHAMAR.

781
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,356
>> SHUT UP!

782
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,316
STOP TALKING.

783
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,693
>> WE'VE GOT TO GO DO IT NOW

784
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,652
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T DO IT.

785
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,404
>> SHUT UP!

786
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,042
I CANNOT WAIT TO WRITE HIS NAME

787
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:07,208
DOWN.

788
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:07,834
I WANT HIM OUT OF HERE.

789
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,544
>> HE'S BEEN THE BIGGEST MOUTH.

790
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:11,421
>> AS I'M SAYING, I'M WITH YOU

791
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:12,839
GUYS, OBVIOUSLY, AND HOPE AND

792
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:13,048
ALLIE.

793
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:13,715
AND ONCE WE VOTE HIM OUT, WE

794
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:14,841
STILL HAVE--

795
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:17,302
>> THAT'S WHAT WE WERE TALKING

796
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,928
ABOUT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

797
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,097
>> IT'S TIME TO GO TO OUR FIRST

798
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,307
TRIBAL COUNCIL AND I HAVE

799
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:26,269
TWO CHOICES RIGHT NOW.

800
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,271
YOU KNOW, MICHAEL AND I HAVE A

801
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:28,897
REALLY STRONG BOND, AND FITOLD

802
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,941
MICHAEL RIGHT NOW, HEY, MAN, I

803
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,109
THINK IT'S BETTER FOR US TO GO

804
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,861
WITH HOPE, ALLIE, EDDIE, AND

805
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:36,905
REYNOLD, THAT HE WOULD FOLLOW

806
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:37,072
SUIT.

807
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:37,822
>> WELL, I'VE SAID MY PIECE.

808
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:38,823
I'M STAYING OUT OF IT.

809
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,493
>> I'M NOT SAYING A WORD TO THE

810
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,787
DUDE UNTIL I WRITE HIS NAME

811
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:44,162
DOWN.

812
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:47,582
MY OTHER OPTION IS TO GO WITH

813
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,876
SHERRI, JULIA, SHAMAR, AND

814
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:50,085
LAURA.

815
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,294
I JUST NEED TO MAKE A DECISION

816
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,630
AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN EASY

817
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,508
ONE.

818
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,635
>> THE QUESTION IS, IS IT SHAMAR

819
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,136
OR IS IT ONE OF THEM?

820
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,137
>> I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY ONE

821
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,097
OF THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE--

822
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,972
>> I DO, TOO.

823
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:06,101
>> HERE'S THE THING, EVEN IF WE

824
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:09,354
VOTE SHAMAR OUT, WE STILL HAVE A

825
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,106
5-4 ADVANTAGE, AND IF WE VOTE

826
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,857
OUT SHAMAR, EVERYBODY WILL BE

827
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:16,986
HAPPY, AND THE FOUR OF THEM,

828
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,863
EDDIE, REYNOLD, HOPE, AND ALLIE

829
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,825
WILL STILL THINK I'M WITH THEM

830
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:22,867
AND THEY HAVE A 5-4 ADVANTAGE.

831
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,537
>> SHAMAR RIGHT NOW IS PISSED

832
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:25,703
OFF.

833
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,414
HE KNOWS HIS NAME IS ON THE

834
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:27,872
BLOCK.

835
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:28,748
HE'S ONE REALIZES HE'S NOT GOING

836
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:29,833
HOME--

837
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:30,583
>> SHAMAR.

838
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:31,793
>> HE'LL CHILL OUT.

839
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:32,836
MATT SAID HE WAS ON THE FENCE

840
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,213
ABOUT VOTING OUT SHAMAR.

841
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,714
IT KIND OF GOT ME A LITTLE

842
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:37,549
WORRIED BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE

843
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:38,174
SURE WHEN I GO TO SLEEP TONIGHT

844
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,468
THAT SHAMAR IS SAFE LAYING NEXT

845
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,511
TO ME.

846
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:41,970
>> DON'T SAY ANY WORD.

847
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,431
WHO WOULD YOU WITHOUT TALKING

848
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,014
WHO WOULD BE THE FIRST PERSON

849
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,226
YOU WOULD SAY?

850
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:51,020
>> I WOULD SAY ONE OF THE GIRLS.

851
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,147
I THINK ALLIE.

852
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,274
>> I'M TOTALLY COOL WITH THAT.

853
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:57,026
>> PERSONALLY, I THINK ALLIE'S A

854
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,777
STRATEGIC THREAT.

855
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:58,778
I THINK SHE'S THE ONLY ONE OUT

856
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,238
OF THE FOUR PRETTY PEOPLE THAT'S

857
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:01,448
REALLY THINKING.

858
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,533
>> SO IT'S ALLIE, UNLESS I HEAR

859
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:03,825
OTHERWISE.

860
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:11,708
>> IT'S ALLIE.

861
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:13,835
>> YOU KNOW, BEING A FAN OF THE

862
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:17,130
GAME, I KNOW THAT HIDDEN

863
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,256
IMMUNITY IDOLS ARE A PART OF

864
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:18,840
THE GAME.

865
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,050
AND I ASSUME THERE'S PROBABLY

866
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:21,968
ONE OUT HERE.

867
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:28,600
AND I DEFINITELY WANT IT.

868
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:43,406
THEY'RE USUALLY UNDER A TREE.

869
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,867
IT'S JUST A ROCK.

870
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:52,207
HOLY ( BLEEP ) 3 YOU'VE GOT TO

871
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:52,957
BE KIDDING ME!

872
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,709
ALL RIGHT, I REALLY-- I'VE BEEN

873
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:56,544
LOOKING FOR, LIKE, NOT THAT

874
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:56,711
LONG.

875
00:29:56,794 --> 00:29:57,921
I WAS JUST THINKING WHERE WOULD

876
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:01,466
I HIDE AN IMMUNITY IDOL?

877
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:05,762
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TOO CRAZY.

878
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:10,934
THIS IS TOO FREAKING CRAZY.

879
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:11,935
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU FOUND THE

880
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,812
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

881
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,689
THE IMMUNITY IDOL WILL KEEP YOU

882
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,816
SAFE FROM BEING VOTED OFF AT

883
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,734
TRIBAL COUNCIL."

884
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:20,985
I WANT TO TUCK THIS THING AWAY

885
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,112
MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY KNOWS I

886
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,906
HAVE IT.

887
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:28,117
AND THAT IS JUST ABSOLUTELY

888
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,245
FREAKING NUTS THEY JUST FOUND

889
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,037
THIS!

890
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,373
I HAVE FOUND THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY

891
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,958
IDOL, AND I'M, LIKE, REALLY

892
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,417
EXCITED RIGHT NOW, SO I'M TRYING

893
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,337
TO JUST, LIKE, CHECK MYSELF, BE

894
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,880
SMART ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW, NOT

895
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,049
WALK BACK TO CAMP WITH SOME

896
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,259
GIANT, STUPID GRIN ON MY FACE

897
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:48,596
AND A HUGE BULGE IN MY POCKET.

898
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,515
>> I'D RATHER DRINK THAN EAT,

899
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:51,099
PERSONALLY, BUT I'M JUST ONE

900
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:51,266
VOTE.

901
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,892
>> I DON'T CARE.

902
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,686
>> A GIRL NEEDS HER FOOD.

903
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:55,478
( LAUGHS )

904
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:55,979
>> WE SHOULD JUST VOTE.

905
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,398
>> LET'S JUST VOTE.

906
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,233
IT SOUNDS LIKE MORE PEOPLE ARE

907
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:03,570
LEANING TOWARDS WATER.

908
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,946
>> OKAY, SO, RIGHT BEFORE WE'RE

909
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,740
ABOUT TO LEAVE FOR TRIBAL

910
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:11,327
COUNCIL, I SEE A BULGE IN

911
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,078
REYNOLD'S POCKET.

912
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,789
AND IT SEEMED LIKE THERE WAS

913
00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:18,001
DEFINITELY SOMETHING IN IT.

914
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,545
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THE ONLY

915
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:23,381
THING YOU WOULD PUT IN YOUR

916
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,007
POCKET BEFORE TRIBAL COUNCIL IS

917
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,843
THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

918
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,052
SO I'M, LIKE, WHAT'S GOING ON

919
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:28,261
HERE?

920
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,138
IS THIS GOING TO MESS UP OUR

921
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,599
PLAN TO GET ALLIE OFF TONIGHT?

922
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:33,933
BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT ALLIE

923
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,560
AND REYNOLD ARE REALLY CLOSE AND

924
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:36,185
THERE'S DEFINITELY A POSSIBILITY

925
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:39,689
THAT HE COULD PASS IT TO HER AND

926
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:40,815
SAVE HER BUTT, AND WE'RE TRYING

927
00:31:40,898 --> 00:31:41,190
TO GET HER OFF.

928
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,067
AND IF HE PASSED THAT IDOL TO

929
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,278
ALLIE, THEN IT WOULD BE SHAMAR

930
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,864
GOING HOME AND NOT ALLIE, AND

931
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:48,948
THAT WOULD SCREW US OVER.

932
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,074
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT I'M THE

933
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,243
ONLY ONE THAT KNOWS.

934
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,661
BUT AT THIS POINT, THERE'S

935
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,621
REALLY NOT ENOUGH TIME TO TALK

936
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,748
TO THE REST OF OUR ALLIANCE.

937
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,750
SO I'M FREAKING OUT A LITTLE

938
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:02,587
BIT.

939
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,358
>> Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS

940
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,150
A TORCH.

941
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,193
GO AHEAD AND GRAB A TORCH.

942
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,112
APPROACH THE FLAME, DIP IT IN,

943
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:31,949
AND GET FIRE.

944
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,034
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF

945
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:36,079
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS

946
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,206
GAME, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

947
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,583
WHEN YOUR FIRE'S GONE, SO ARE

948
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:40,750
YOU.

949
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:41,959
THAT IS GOING TO BE THE CASE FOR

950
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,671
ONE OF YOU TONIGHT.

951
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,047
SO, MICHAEL, WHAT'S IT LIKE TO

952
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,131
FEND FOR YOURSELVES IN A

953
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,050
MILLION-DOLLAR GAME WITH PEOPLE

954
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,968
YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T ACTUALLY

955
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,845
HAVE THAT MUCH IN COMMON?

956
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,598
>> WELL, MATT, AND SHERRI HAVE

957
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,808
FAMILIES IN COMMON.

958
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:57,725
THEY'RE MARRIED AND THEY HAVE

959
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,017
CHILDREN.

960
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,978
AND THEN THERE'S THE FOURSOME.

961
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,690
EDDIE AND HOPE AND ALLIE AND

962
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:03,898
REYNOLD.

963
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:06,734
>> Jeff: SO, ALLIE, DID YOU

964
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,194
GUYS JUST QUICKLY BECOME FAST

965
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,153
FRIEND THE FOUR OF YOU?

966
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,446
>> YEAH, I THINK IT'S KIND OF

967
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,572
THE SAME AGE GROUP.

968
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,449
WE HAVE THE SAME THINGS IN

969
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:13,950
COMMON.

970
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,785
WE WEREN'T EXCLUDING ANYBODY

971
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:15,952
OUT.

972
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,453
IT JUST KIND OF HAPPENED.

973
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,622
IT'S SOMETHING WE WOULD DO ON

974
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:20,164
THE OUTSIDE.

975
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,916
>> Jeff: SHAMAR, WHAT'S YOUR

976
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:22,583
TAKE ON THE FOUR?

977
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,086
>> EDDIE AND HOPE SEEM LIKE A

978
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,295
COUPLE AND THESE TWO SEEM PART

979
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,880
OF THE FOURSOME.

980
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,841
>> Jeff: MATT, CONCERN YOU AT

981
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,467
ALL THAT THERE ARE FOUR PEOPLE

982
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,219
OPENLY SAYING,"WE'RE SIMILAR SO

983
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:34,345
WE HANG OUT A LOT TOGETHER ON

984
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:34,637
THE BEACH?"

985
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:35,179
>> NO.

986
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,306
LIKE, THEY SLEEP ON THE BEACH

987
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:37,598
TOGETHER.

988
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,808
MAYBE IT'S MORE COMFORTABLE FOR

989
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,393
THEM THAN THE SHELTER.

990
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,395
BUT I'M NOT, LIKE, MAJORLY

991
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,146
CONCERNED, NO.

992
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:46,649
>> Jeff: SHAMAR, HOW HAS THIS

993
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,150
EXPERIENCE BEEN FOR YOU?

994
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,110
>> JEFF, I'M 300 POUNDS.

995
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,236
I'VE HAD, YOU KNOW, TWO SCOOPS

996
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,155
OF RICE AND THREE COCONUTS SINCE

997
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,699
I'VE BEEN HERE SO I'M KIND OF

998
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,743
JUST DRAINED A LITTLE BIT,

999
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,161
TRYING TO CONSERVE MY ENERGY.

1000
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:58,619
>> Jeff: WHAT'S YOUR

1001
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,245
BACKGROUND, SHAMAR?

1002
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,079
IS THIS THE TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT

1003
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,289
YOU'RE USED TO OR IS THIS A

1004
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,790
SHOCK TO YOU?

1005
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,333
>> NO, I'VE DONE TWO TOURS IN

1006
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,335
IRAQ WHERE I'VE BEEN IN, YOU

1007
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,004
KNOW, DESERT SITUATIONS AND

1008
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,172
SITUATIONS WHERE I DIDN'T HAVE

1009
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,799
MUCH FOOD, AND THE ONLY

1010
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:12,967
DIFFERENCE IS WE'VE HAD LEADERS

1011
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,385
IN THE MARINE CORPS, AND A LOT

1012
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,220
OF PEOPLE HERE ARE INDIVIDUALS,

1013
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,514
AND IT'S NOT LIKE A TEAM EFFORT

1014
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:18,848
ALL THE TIME.

1015
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,641
YOU KNOW, NOBODY WANTS TO

1016
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:20,850
LISTEN.

1017
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,268
THEY WANT TO DO IT THEIR OWN

1018
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,060
WAY, SO...

1019
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,103
>> Jeff: MICHAEL, IS THAT WHAT

1020
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,313
HAPPENED TODAY AT THE CHALLENGE?

1021
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:25,855
WERE THERE TOO MANY VOICES?

1022
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:28,232
>> YEAH, I QUE WHILE WE WERE

1023
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,233
STRATEGIZING THAT WE WERE IN

1024
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:29,484
TROUBLE.

1025
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,612
I MEAN, YOU HAVE NINE PEOPLE GO

1026
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,363
OUT IN THE FIELD WITHOUT ANYBODY

1027
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,199
THINKING, WELL, WHOSE THE BEST

1028
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:36,449
PITCHER?

1029
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,659
WHO'S THE BEST CATCHER?

1030
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:39,952
AND NOBODY MAKING THE DECISIONS.

1031
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,163
AND THEN IT GOT HEAT, YOU KNOW.

1032
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,831
>> Jeff: SO, REYNOLD, THIS WAS

1033
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,458
GOING DOWN MOMENTS BEFORE AN

1034
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:45,875
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

1035
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,919
>> JEFF, I THINK TO WIN THESE

1036
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,170
CHALLENGES YOU REAL NEED TO BE

1037
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,171
ONE COHESIVE UNIT.

1038
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,340
BUT I THINK PEOPLE GET

1039
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,925
FRUSTRATED WITH SHAMAR'S

1040
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:54,801
CRITIQUES OF HOW EVERYONE IS

1041
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,302
DOING THEIR JOB AND SHAMAR KIND

1042
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:58,054
OF SITS IN THE SHELTER ALL DAY

1043
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,430
WHILE WE'RE ALL SWEATING AND

1044
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,807
COVERED IN CUTS AND RASHES.

1045
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,225
THAT'S WHERE THE FRUSTRATION

1046
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,976
COMES.

1047
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,604
FUP US TO THROW OUT, LIKE, 25

1048
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:07,355
EXACT EXAMPLES WE'LL BE HERE ALL

1049
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:07,522
NIGHT.

1050
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,190
I'M NOT GOING TO WASTE YOUR

1051
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,358
TIME, JEFF.

1052
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,818
>> Jeff: SHAMAR, YOU'RE

1053
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:12,068
LAUGHING.

1054
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:12,693
>> BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GIVE

1055
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,029
YOU 25 EXAMPLES RIGHT NOW, YOU

1056
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:15,863
KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

1057
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:16,364
>> SHAMAR WAS IN THE HUT

1058
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,282
YESTERDAY FOR 19 HOURS.

1059
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,450
>> Jeff: 19 OF 24 HOURS?

1060
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:22,078
>> YEAH, WHILE WE KEPT THE FIRE

1061
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,871
BURNING, MADE DINNER, CUT

1062
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:24,121
COCONUTS.

1063
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:24,997
WE WANT SHAMAR TO COME OUT AND

1064
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,208
HANG OUT BUT IT WASN'T

1065
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:27,458
HAPPENING.

1066
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,793
>> Jeff: SHAMAR WERE YOU IN

1067
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:30,002
THE SHELTER FOR THE MAJORITY OF

1068
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:30,294
THE DAY?

1069
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,921
>> OH, YEAH, VERY MUCH SO.

1070
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:34,715
I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M A GOOD

1071
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:34,966
SCAPEGOAT.

1072
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:35,550
I'VE BEEN THE OUTCAST A LITTLE

1073
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,468
BIT FROM DAY ONE.

1074
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,928
>> Jeff: BASED ON WHAT DO YOU

1075
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:39,136
THINK?

1076
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,013
>> I THINK I'M BIG AND LOUD,

1077
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:41,222
JEFF.

1078
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,099
I THINK I'M JUST A BIG, LOUD

1079
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:43,266
GUY.

1080
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,268
>> Jeff: LAURA, BEFORE WE GET

1081
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:46,978
TO THE VOTE, WHAT DO YOU MAKE

1082
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:47,270
ABOUT THIS?

1083
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,689
>> WELL, COMING IN HERE TONIGHT,

1084
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:50,982
I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT

1085
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:54,485
WE WERE VOTING AS A FAMILY.

1086
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:58,030
BUT I DID SEE SOMETHING ELSE GO

1087
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,156
DOWN.

1088
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:04,495
I SAW A BULGE FROM ONE POCKET.

1089
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,748
>> Jeff: ARE YOU GOING TO SAY

1090
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,499
WHO?

1091
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:12,587
>> I WILL NOT SAY WHO.

1092
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:12,962
NO.

1093
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,630
>> Jeff: WELL, YOU'RE LOOKING

1094
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:19,302
DIRECTLY AT REYNOLD.

1095
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:23,097
>> YEF, JEFF, I'M HOLDING THE

1096
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,142
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL I FOUND ON

1097
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,685
THE ISLAND.

1098
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:28,269
APPARENTLY, MY PANT ARE TOO

1099
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,438
TIGHT, AND YOU CAN SEE THE IDOL

1100
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,689
IN MY POCKET, AND I DIDN'T KNOW

1101
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,524
WHAT WAS GOING TO GO DOWN

1102
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:33,774
TONIGHT.

1103
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,276
I STILL THOUGHT WE WERE A BIG,

1104
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,611
HAPPY FAMILY AS WELL, AND I

1105
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:39,322
THOUGHT WE WERE VOTING

1106
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:39,739
UNANIMOUSLY.

1107
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,157
>> THEN WHY BRING IT TO TRIBAL

1108
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:41,407
COUNCIL.

1109
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,408
>> THIS IS "SURVIVOR."

1110
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,827
IF YOU HAVE A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1111
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,079
IDOL, WHY WOULD YOU NOT WRING IT

1112
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,874
TO TRIBAL COUNCIL IS THAT NOT

1113
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,208
"SURVIVOR 101."

1114
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,169
JEFF, IT'S A SHAME BECAUSE I'M

1115
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,254
PLAYING RIGHT NOW TO BEAT THE

1116
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:55,504
FAVORITES.

1117
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,213
>> Jeff:

1118
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:56,714
