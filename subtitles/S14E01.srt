1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:11,761
>> JEFF PROBST: We are flying

2
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:12,762
over the stunning water of the

3
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,098
Fiji Islands, a place once known

4
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,767
for its cannibalism, uncharted

5
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,812
reefs, and formidable warriors.

6
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:22,605
These islands are home to

7
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,649
spectacular sea life and lush,

8
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:30,113
jagged terrain.

9
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,239
Just below are 19 strangers

10
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:35,034
that represent an extreme

11
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,745
cross-section of America, from a

12
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,955
former homeless street performer

13
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:41,040
to a Harvard-educated lawyer.

14
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,792
They have been given absolutely

15
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,377
no information.

16
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,795
The fear of the unknown is so

17
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,797
strong that one survivor quit

18
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,841
just moments before being set

19
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,301
adrift miles from shore.

20
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:55,138
Exile Island is back, with

21
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:58,057
hundreds of deadly sea snakes.

22
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,642
And this time, two hidden

23
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,060
immunity idols will complicate

24
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:06,149
the game like never before.

25
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:09,652
39 days, 19 people, one

26
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,196
survivor.

27
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:24,667
>> When I got there, I noticed

28
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,543
we were, like, all 19 of us

29
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,004
together.

30
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:29,005
I thought that Jeff was going to

31
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,798
be there and we were going to

32
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:30,548
be, like, split into tribes, and

33
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:31,216
"You go this way and you go the

34
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,425
other way."

35
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:46,272
But it wasn't the case.

36
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,399
>> In my past, where I used to

37
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,234
work and stuff, they called me

38
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,235
Stallone.

39
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,277
They called me... I guess I look

40
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:51,820
like Sylvester Stallone or

41
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,112
Rocky.

42
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,697
I have droopy eyes, dark hair.

43
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,824
For some reason James was too

44
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:56,825
hard for them to remember, so

45
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,577
Rocky will suffice.

46
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:05,708
>> We were just so excited to

47
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:06,376
get here, it didn't matter what

48
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,335
we were doing.

49
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,671
We were lost on a deserted

50
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,089
island, you know?

51
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,423
What would anybody do?

52
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,883
Go explore.

53
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:14,884
>> Oh, it's water!

54
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,345
>> Yeah, water!

55
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,514
>> Water!

56
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:22,058
>> Where?

57
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:23,143
>> Filled my canteen.

58
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,102
I'll tell you right now, I lost

59
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,061
my mind.

60
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:25,812
I didn't know what to do, I

61
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:26,855
didn't know what to say.

62
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:27,522
I was running around like a

63
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,941
chicken with my head cut off.

64
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,697
>> We look, and there's this

65
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,531
big, beautiful cave.

66
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,407
We're like, "This is a blessing.

67
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,658
We're like, "We're great."

68
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,118
>> I found a lemon tree.

69
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,119
>> We've got banana trees over

70
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:41,327
there.

71
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,328
We've got papaya over there.

72
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,331
We are stoked.

73
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,878
>> Well, my real name is Andre.

74
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,170
But on this beach I go by

75
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,381
Dreamz.

76
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,678
I came up with the name Dreamz a

77
00:02:58,761 --> 00:02:59,762
long time ago.

78
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,097
It was more of a name of

79
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,558
striving and achievement.

80
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,059
>> I'm glad we came up here.

81
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,061
Now, look at this.

82
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,730
It's like buying a new house.

83
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,148
You know, you want to see

84
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,482
everything-- the backyard, the

85
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,692
front yard, living room, the

86
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:13,902
dining room.

87
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,069
You want to see everything

88
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:15,528
that's in your house.

89
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,447
And this is our house.

90
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,948
I'm the king of Fiji, of an

91
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,784
unnamed island.

92
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,709
>> My outdoor experience up to

93
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:30,919
this point consisted of being

94
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,211
maybe 20 to 40 feet off the

95
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,296
road.

96
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,381
This is totally new for me--

97
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,550
sleeping outdoors, finding food.

98
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,886
I love coconut, but it's

99
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:40,929
granulated, already shredded in

100
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:41,763
the grocery store.

101
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,182
So...

102
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,562
>> It is, I see.

103
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,521
>> But believe me, it's worth

104
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:50,688
it.

105
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,231
>> Oh, okay.

106
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,609
>> Okay?

107
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:02,367
>> Wow!

108
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,285
So you're a native, huh?

109
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,578
>> I'm native, almost.

110
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,746
I am definitely trying to prove

111
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,831
myself.

112
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,500
I can see that all the other

113
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,001
guys are quite young, like half

114
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:12,460
my age.

115
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,629
Old people are usually the first

116
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:15,964
ones to get booted off, so I'm

117
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,131
hoping I will be the exception

118
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:17,632
here because I know the

119
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,384
surroundings, and I can help get

120
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:23,763
them coconut to drink.

121
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,056
>> Did you just open that?

122
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,975
Oh, thanks!

123
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:27,767
>> So what are you thinking

124
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,810
right now?

125
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:29,644
>> Man, I don't know.

126
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:30,770
Too many people in one place

127
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:31,646
right now.

128
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:32,522
That's what makes me a little

129
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,398
bit nervous.

130
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,440
>> Yeah.

131
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,984
>> What do you think?

132
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,360
>> I mean, there's 19 of us.

133
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,611
So how do you split that up into

134
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,196
two tribes?

135
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,072
>> We're like, you know, looking

136
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:41,948
around the island for a machete.

137
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:42,991
We're looking for, like, flags

138
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:43,825
for our tribe.

139
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:44,867
We don't have a pot, we don't

140
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,618
have water, we don't have

141
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,452
anything.

142
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,453
We don't even know our tribe

143
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,329
name, you know?

144
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,330
It's incredibly overwhelming,

145
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,456
because there are so many people

146
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,749
and none of us have a clue

147
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,792
what's going on.

148
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,793
We're looking for Jeff Probst.

149
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,254
We're like, "Where's Jeff?"

150
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,386
>> Come on, we've got visitors!

151
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,441
>> Bring it in!

152
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,031
>> Where's the box?

153
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:23,906
>> I think they got it.

154
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,824
>> Oh, they got it?

155
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:25,867
>> Yeah.

156
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,035
>> We have a box!

157
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:27,869
>> Our heroes!

158
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,787
>> It's got a genie in it!

159
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,538
>> Everybody was excited.

160
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,623
Maybe we can get a machete.

161
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:33,916
Maybe we can get fire.

162
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,293
Everybody was anticipating what

163
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,086
they wanted to be in that box.

164
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,296
>> Wait, that can't be the way

165
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,757
into the box.

166
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,387
>> Rocky!

167
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:46,596
Rocky!

168
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,599
Rocky!

169
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,477
>> Whoa!

170
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,690
>> The strongest guys start,

171
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,358
like, throwing that thing down,

172
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,027
hammering it, punching it.

173
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,029
And here comes the little

174
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:06,365
scrawny guy, Yau-Man.

175
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,867
And he opens the whole thing

176
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,036
like, you know, in ten seconds.

177
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,287
>> It takes a real man to do it.

178
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,956
>> Very simple physics.

179
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,832
The weakest point is to drop it

180
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,167
on its corner.

181
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,293
So I dropped it on its corner

182
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,629
twice, and the box opened up.

183
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:25,927
>> Listen up.

184
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,387
This is very important.

185
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:27,845
>> "Welcome survivors.

186
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:28,554
Before you do anything else, you

187
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,390
must find the hidden cache of

188
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:31,808
lumber and supplies.

189
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,893
Its location is shown on the

190

map."

191
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,104

there.

200
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,905

before drinking.

205

Do not waste any time."

206
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,579
>> Let's rock 'n' roll.

207
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,622
>> You know, we've got this map

208
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:55,998
and directions and instructions

209
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,125
that says, you know, we have to

210
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,501
build a shelter, kitchen, and a

211
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,628
toilet and a picnic table.

212
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,843
>> Initially, naively, I

213
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,553
thought, "Wow, this is awesome."

214
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,638
And then I thought, "Wait a

215
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,140
minute, this is<i> Survivor.</i>

216
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,391
This is going to mean something

217
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,267
very cruel is going to happen

218
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,268
very soon."

219
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,686
>> Let's go do it.

220
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:36,664
>> Excuse me, brother.

221
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:37,748
>> Okay.

222
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,125
Here's the fork.

223
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,376
Go straight this way.

224
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:41,210
>> It's got to be right there.

225
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,380
>> Yeah.

226
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:45,882
>> I think I found it.

227
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:46,549
>> Holy cow!

228
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,968
>> All right, all right!

229
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,512
>> Ah!

230
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,390
>> What we found at the top of

231
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:54,974
the hill was just all kinds of

232
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:55,725
lumber.

233
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,601
And it was, like, shingles for

234
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,686
the roof of the shelter.

235
00:07:58,769 --> 00:07:59,770
There was all these crazy things

236
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:00,771
that no one in their right minds

237
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,315
would ever imagine that we

238
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,608
were going to get when we got

239
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,400
here.

240
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:06,360
>> Look at all the tools!

241
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,905
>> Nails, hammers!

242
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:09,614
>> We got a bag of rice the

243
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,616
first day we were here. brother.

244
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,909
You know, maybe a machete and

245
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:13,784
bucket to boil water-- that's

246
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,036
what anybody was expecting.

247
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:15,661
No way... we have a toilet seat.

248
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,705
I'll say it again, a toilet

249
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:18,706
seat.

250
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:19,707
>> Okay, you, you, and you carry

251
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,250
all that stuff down.

252
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,838
>> One on each shoulder.

253
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,216
>> Give me that toilet seat.

254
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,842
I've never seen where people

255
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:30,635
that come on<i> Survivor</i> have this

256
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,595
much, so I'm really nervous,

257
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,638
because I think a curve ball is

258
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:33,888
coming.

259
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,598
It's too easy.

260
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,807
>> The kitchen's going to be

261
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,975
right there, okay?

262
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,436
The outhouse will be over there.

263
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,604
There was a site plan, and being

264
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,772
an architect, of course, I was

265
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,233
given all of the maps and said,

266
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,651
"Here, you figure out what to

267
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,735
do."

268
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:48,861
So I looked at the site plan and

269
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:49,779
realized the cave was, in fact,

270
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:53,449
the location of the shelter.

271
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,034
Then there would be a kitchen

272
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,744
and an outhouse, and it was...

273
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,037
it's a pretty amazing set of

274
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,872
drawings.

275
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,874
So we're building.

276
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,209
Who's got the site plan?

277
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,418
>> There's our shovels, all

278
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:04,794
right?

279
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,754
>> We need the shovel brigade to

280
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:07,838
start shoveling four holes.

281
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,048
That's our number one thing.

282
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:09,632
Who's got the shovel?

283
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,676
Who's got the site plan?

284
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,010
Who's got the tape measure?

285
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,096
We need a crew for the kitchen,

286
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,264
or else it won't be done until

287
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,474
tomorrow.

288
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:19,892
>> I do get the sense that

289
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,227
Sylvia's trying to dominate.

290
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,228
You know, we're all here to do

291
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,437
this together, and you're going

292
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,522
to upset the wagon by doing

293
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,857
that.

294
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:29,610
>> He's what?

295
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,862
All right, here's what's going

296
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,030
to happen-- whenever there is a

297
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:33,906
big word in a sentence, we're

298
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,865
all going to have a time-out and

299
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,325
teach James the big word, the

300
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,619
definition.

301
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,917
>> There's another big word

302
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:45,793
James... orthagonal, huh?

303
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,212
Learn something new every day,

304
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,799
right?

305
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,051
(<i> cheers</i> )

306
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,803
>> All right!

307
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:56,637
>> Proud of you!

308
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,806
>> When we started construction,

309
00:09:58,889 --> 00:09:59,932
everybody was, like, trying to,

310
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,267
like, you know, prove to other

311
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,268
people that they can handle the

312
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,728
workload.

313
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:04,937
But as, you know, the workload

314
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,355
started going on and on, and the

315
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,440
people started going out in

316
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,482
couples, you could see that some

317
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,901
people were talking.

318
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:17,950
>> I'm trying to talk to people

319
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,076
and see what's going on so I

320
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,286
can... you know, so I can get my

321
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:20,745
place here.

322
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,663
>> Okay.

323
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,956
>> So right now, just me, you.

324
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,957
>> We need a guy.

325
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,042
>> We do need a guy.

326
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,376
>> Who?

327
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:27,710
>> I don't know.

328
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:31,172
Me and Jessica have kind of

329
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,715
got... you know, we're talking,

330
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:33,966
getting some stuff... getting

331
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,760
some stuff together.

332
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,470
We don't really know what's

333
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,554
going to happen, so I think I

334
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:39,597
need to be talking to as many

335
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,892
people as I can.

336
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,060
>> No, y'all are just being

337
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:44,894
silly.

338
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,103
This water its too hot to drink.

339
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,355
>> Just drink it, man.

340
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,481
>> It just burned me.

341
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:49,398
I ain't going to drink it.

342
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,316
It burned me.

343
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,150
>> So you guys want to... when

344
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:51,859
you're done with the water, do

345
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,110
you want to help with the

346
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,070
bathroom, or do you want to

347
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:54,987
start with the kitchen?

348
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,197
I feel like it's not moving

349
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,490
nearly as fast as it should,

350
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:58,074
because we're still working on

351
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:58,908
the primary shelter when the

352
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,701
kitchens and bathroom still need

353
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:01,952
to be built.

354
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:02,995
We've got to get everything done

355
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:03,871
okay?

356
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:04,872
So put down...

357
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:05,790
>> We need to get this done,

358
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:06,749
because we're running out of

359
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:06,916
light.

360
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,960
And we have to have this done.

361
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,244
>> The night was rough.

362
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,954
There we are with the shelter

363
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:45,955
half done, no roof, half a

364
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,250
floor, and we ended up getting

365
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,127
soaked.

366
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,586
So today we need to finish our

367
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:52,795
shelter.

368
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:53,879
>> Can you, you know, lead a

369
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,424
bunch of people to bring all the

370
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,135
material down?

371
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,057
>> It should be a two-by-four.

372
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,183
>> Two-by-four?

373
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,017
Well....

374
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,186
>> This is a cup.

375
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,939
Hold on to it.

376
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,275
This is the funnel.

377
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,986
>> Yau-Man, he's a keeper.

378
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,070
He figures out every little

379
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,989
thing that goes on.

380
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,158
>> Drink in good health.

381
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,660
>> Good hot tea.

382
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:25,870
>> Lemon.

383
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,208
>> We're getting together.

384
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,460
All 19 of us are bonding.

385
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,002
I don't know if it's a good

386
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:33,794
thing or a bad thing, but it's

387
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:34,879
bonding us.

388
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,006
Oh, my god!

389
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,174
That looks beautiful!

390
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,842
>> We're rockin'.

391
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,177
I'm taking this one home.

392
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,303
We've been here almost two days

393
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,721
trying to figure out what's

394
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,181
going on.

395
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,974
I think we just keep getting to

396
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,017
know each other until we get to

397
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,310
the point where we get the next

398
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,895
set of instructions.

399
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,320
>> We have a shelter.

400
00:12:59,403 --> 00:12:59,904
It has a floor and a roof.

401
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,239
We're going to have a kitchen.

402
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,199
We have an outhouse with an

403
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,992
actual toilet.

404
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,035
It's really surprising to have

405
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,829
so much on day two.

406
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,085
>> We're feeling pretty lucky

407
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,462
right now.

408
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,713
I mean, this is my Fiji vacation

409
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,423
right now.

410
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,049
I mean, we have everything that

411
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,134
we need.

412
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,470
I'm scared about what's coming.

413
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,055
>> All of your hard work to make

414
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,890
this place kind of a home for

415
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,225
now!

416
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,267
>> Nice!

417
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,060
>> (<i> applause</i> )

418
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,853
>> Everybody!

419
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,481
Everybody!

420
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,106
>> I can't take all the credit.

421
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,275
Okay, I can.

422
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,944
But I just want to thank all my

423
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,071
people for getting me coconuts

424
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,280
while I was working.

425
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,699
Back as a child, I was pretty

426
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,285
much homeless.

427
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,287
By the age of seven, I was out

428
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:50,955
of a house and just stayed in

429
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,081
the back of a soup kitchen.

430
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,082
And then go into the trash cans

431
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:53,999
and get the food.

432
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,084
And it... I mean, it was kind of

433
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,753
like what's going on right now.

434
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,505
The only thing you have to worry

435
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,173
about is when it rains or when

436
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,133
you can't find no more food.

437
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,176
I love it.

438
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,052
I wish I could bring my family

439
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,596
from home here.

440
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,520
>> What kind of name is Earl?

441
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:14,937
>> Dreamz?

442
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,524
>> What kind of name is Dreamz?

443
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:19,483
>> Who said that?

444
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,568
Who said that?

445
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:20,901
Back there.

446
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:21,902
Is that a Chinese person that

447
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,321
said that?

448
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,573
My thing is to be playful and

449
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,782
play too much, just to make sure

450
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:29,159
they notice that I'm present, to

451
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,327
know that my presence is there.

452
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,746
Were you as great as I, you

453
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,873
could say what you want to say.

454
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:40,879
>> You know what?

455
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,842
>> Is he going to be quiet at

456
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,010
all tonight?

457
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:46,969
>> Dreamz kind of came out of

458
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:47,553
nowhere, like, late, while we

459
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,137
were all trying to sleep.

460
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,139
He was going off on little

461
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,098
rants, like, every 15 to 20

462
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,808
minutes.

463
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:53,851
>> Where all the white people

464
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:54,768
here?

465
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:55,728
If you're white, raise your

466
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:56,937
hand.

467
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,648
Rock, what color are you, man?

468
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,192
>> I'm Italian, Irish, and

469
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,360
Spanish.

470
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,236
>> You're talking to him or are

471
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,070
you going to talk to me?

472
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,156
>> Just yelling about nonsense.

473
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,199
And I'm exhausted.

474
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,159
I don't know if the island is

475
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:10,951
getting to him, but he's just

476
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,745
getting a little irritating.

477
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:13,454
Why don't you give me two

478
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,204
seconds to talk, and then you

479
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,247
can speak and we'll be done.

480
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,248
>> Go ahead, talk.

481
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,333
>> All right, you get a little

482
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,000
crazy sometimes.

483
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:18,334
>> Just talk.

484
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,752
>> I'm talking right now.

485
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:20,544
I'm talking to you right now.

486
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,337
You get a little jumpy with your

487
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,212
voice.

488
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,380
You snap, you snap... I don't

489
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,214
care what you do with anybody

490
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,049
else, you snap a little bit at

491
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:25,215
me.

492
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,884
All right, I'm telling you right

493
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:27,635
now, I don't want to be treated

494
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,260
like that.

495
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,178
Okay?

496
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:29,803
I'm just trying to go to sleep.

497
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:30,679
I've been running around all

498
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,263
day.

499
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,348
I don't need you to raise your

500
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,015
voice to me.

501
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:33,891
Because I'm not a little girl.

502
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:34,558
>> I don't yell at people.

503
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,225
That's not me.

504
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,143
>> What are you doing now?

505
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:36,602
>> I'm talking to you.

506
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,645
I'm talking to you.

507
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,228
I haven't yelled at anybody

508
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,271
here.

509
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:39,730
>> You're crazy, dude.

510
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:40,856
>> And I'm not going to let

511
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:41,774
anybody belittle me.

512
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:42,441
>> What do I stand to gain by

513
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,233
belittling you?

514
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,151
What do I stand to gain?

515
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,277
>> I don't know.

516
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:45,444
Why?

517
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,862
>> Because you yelled at me!

518
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:47,613
That's why, that's why!

519
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,238
>> You are yelling right now.

520
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,198
>> Because you don't pay

521
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,240
attention.

522
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,033
I'm trying to explain it to you.

523
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:51,450
>> No, you yelled.

524
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,910
>> Go back to bed.

525
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:53,702
Go back to bed and hang out with

526
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,495
your friends.

527
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,997
>> Whatever, Rock.

528
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,415
>> I'm pretty hard on myself

529
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,416
when it comes to, like, letting

530
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,250
my emotions show.

531
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,377
I hate to do it.

532
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,252
I used to do it when I was

533
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,003
young, and I think I'm past that

534
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,046
now.

535
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,089
But it's just really hard,

536
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,173
especially under the conditions

537
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,049
we're under right now.

538
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,385
What am I supposed to do?

539
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:30,531
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

540
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,623
Welcome to<i> Survivor: Fiji.</i>

541
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,875
Jessica, tell me about the first

542
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,711
few moments.

543
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:44,920
You hit the beach.

544
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:45,921
What happens?

545
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:47,089
>> It was wild.

546
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,507
It was like a big beach party.

547
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,883
>> PROBST: Yau-Man, I dropped a

548
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,970
package out of the sky.

549
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:53,554
Tell me about the reaction.

550
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:54,263
>> Someone found the canister

551
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,139
and decided to open it and saw

552
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,056
the plans.

553
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,933
And it's not just any shelter.

554
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:58,851
It looks like a very fancy

555
00:16:58,934 --> 00:16:59,101
shelter.

556
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,520
And we're supposed to build it.

557
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,688
>> PROBST: Alex, when you

558
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:03,313
started to assemble the shelter,

559
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,066
did anybody emerge as the

560
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,526
driving force on how to approach

561
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,652
this?

562
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,945
>> I think initially we were all

563
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:12,489
pretty confused, but luckily, we

564
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,241
have an architect on board.

565
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,367
So...

566
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,243
>> Who's the architect?

567
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:16,493
>> Sylvia.

568
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,870
>> Sylvia right here.

569
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:18,871
>> So, I mean, having an

00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:19,747

571
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,706
helpful.

572
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,249
>> PROBST: So the first big task

573
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,709
is to build the shelter.

574
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,169
And Sylvia, this is what you do

575
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,170
every day.

576
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,463
>> I was so happy.

00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,756

>> PROBST: So it sounds like,

579
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,174
Sylvia, you really stepped up to

580
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,300
be the leader.

581
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,135
Does that ring true to everybody

582
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,094
here?

583
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:34,303

00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,782

what's going to happen.

You are not on a tribe.

682
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,980
You are still in the game.

00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:32,606
You're going to Exile Island.

00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,525
>> Oh!

have company.

687
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,446
Thousands of sea snakes out

whereabouts of a hidden immunity

00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:48,497
idol.

695
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,331
Secondly, because are you not on

696
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,375
a tribe, you are immune from the

697
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,876
first tribal council.

698
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,503

Boat's waiting for you.

702
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:00,509

Be safe.

708
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,016
>> PROBST: All right, let's go

709
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,976
to today's challenge.

710
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:09,559
For today's challenge, you are

711
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:13,563
going to race chariots across

712
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,732
the Fijian mud flats.

713
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,317
Two people will be on the

714
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,527
chariot.

715
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,153
The other seven will pull you

716
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,197
across a quarter-mile course.

717
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,740
Along the way, the two people on

718
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,409
the chariot are responsible for

719
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,202
retrieving three bags of puzzle

720
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:28,412
pieces.

721
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,496
When you reach the end of the

722
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,998
course, you'll grab a tribe

723
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,624
flag, come all the way back.

724
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,042
Four tribe members will then use

725
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,627
those puzzle pieces to solve

726
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,129
three puzzles.

727
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,588
This will give you the numbers

728
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,798
you need to solve a combination

729
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,633
wheel.

730
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,551
You will turn it clockwise,

731
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,720
counter-clockwise, clockwise.

732
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,639
If you count correctly, you will

733
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,141
find a knife.

734
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,392
You'll take the knife, chop a

735
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,644
rope, dropping a tribe flag.

736
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,478
First tribe to drop their flag

737
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,440
wins the challenge.

738
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,150
Want to know what you're playing

739
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:58,984
for?

740
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,027
>> Yeah.

(<i> applause</i> )

744
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,908
Winning tribe gets immunity, is

745
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:07,993
safe from the first tribal

746
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,036
council.

747
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,412
In addition to immunity, the

748
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,289
winning tribe gets to stay on

749
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:17,377
the beach that all 19 of you put

blood, sweat, and tears into

00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:19,421
building.

752

>> All right, we can do this.

753
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,257
We can do this.

754
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,258
>> PROBST: And when you get

755
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:24,134

00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,485
Candles.

952
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:19,948
>> We got hammocks.

953
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,825
>> Shower!

954
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,828
>> We've got a beer mug.

955
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,710
>> Dreamz.

956
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:33,586
>> Oh, cool.

957
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,129
>> Give me that one, baby.

958
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,880
>> It feels so spectacular.

959
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,383
Not only did we get immunity,

960
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,593
not only did we go back to the

961
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,761
place we helped put together.

962
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,179
We came back with a kick-ass

963
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,305
tribe.

964
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,099
All right, to us, guys!

965
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:46,975
>> To Moto!

966
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:50,770
>> Ironically enough, Sylvia,

967
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:51,980
she helped build this place, and

968
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,231
now she's sleeping with the

969
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,275
snakes.

970
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,410
>> When I found out I was being

971
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:07,245
exiled to Exile Island, Jeff was

972
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,830
very clear that it was good and

973
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,206
there was bad.

974
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:10,957
The bad was that I would be here

975
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,959
by myself with a bunch of sea

976
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:16,129
snakes.

977
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,182
Jeff had wander me about these

978
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,057
sea snakes and I thought he was

979
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,017
trying to pull my chain, you

980
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,185
know.

981
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,019
But it's for real.

982
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,979
I see them still.

983
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,022
I see them.

984
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,191
Oh, boy.

985
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,235
The good was that I got the

986
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:39,861
immunity.

987
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:43,781
And there would be a clue giving

988
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:44,991
me some kind of hint about where

989
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:48,870
the immunity idol was hidden.

990
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:52,874
Wow, pretty spectacular.

991
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,296
>> "Here you won't find the idol

992
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,464
you crave.

993
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,798
Search back at your camp if you

994
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:01,883
hope to be saved."

995
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,469
Okay.

996
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,680
I've been given this opportunity

997
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,182
of a clue.

998
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:10,058
But the clue said, "Sorry, it's

999
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,893
not here.

1000
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,978
It's back at camp."

1001
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:14,896
So now I have to figure out a

1002
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,190
time and a place where I can

1003
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,733
search for it without prying

1004
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:19,734
eyes.

1005
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:20,652
That's going to be a challenge

1006
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,111
in itself.

1007
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:35,416
>> We're home.

1008
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,341
>> Losing the challenge today

1009
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:44,425
felt horrible.

1010
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,052
All the work we put into the

1011
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,095
shelter, you know, learning the

1012
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,304
island, just everything, you

1013
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:49,430
know, you get accustomed to,

1014
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,015
it's gone.

1015
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:57,564
>> We have a cave right there.

1016
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:58,940
>> Awesome.

1017
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,900
This is awesome!

1018
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,110
This place is so nice!

1019
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,111
>> Is it amazing?

1020
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,028
>> I'm glad we lost.

1021
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,780
(<i> laughter</i> )

1022
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:06,906
Keep their stupid shower.

1023
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,157
>> Yeah, that cave is gorgeous.

1024
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:11,286
The hardest part for me was not

1025
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,745
being able to go back to that

1026
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,955
shelter that we built.

1027
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,707
But, I mean, everybody else

1028
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,874
seems like they're okay.

1029
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:17,792
It's like, "Whatever.

1030
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:19,043
Oh, we lost it, but we're over

1031
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:19,919
here on this great island."

1032
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,130
I mean, they're enjoying the

1033
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,131
blankets and pillows and the

1034
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,383
couch.

1035
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:26,801
We have to start all over.

1036
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:27,343
I'm pissed off, and I can't

1037
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,095
believe nobody else is.

1038
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,680
We worked hard on building that

1039
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:31,681
shelter, kitchen.

1040
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,141
We worked hard.

1041
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,100
And that hurt the most.

1042
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,935
>> Right now, we're back at

1043
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,979
square one, because we have

1044
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,397
nothing.

1045
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,773
And at the same time, we've got

1046
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:41,983
to figure out a team member to

1047
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:49,282
lose.

1048
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,408
>> Yeah.

1049
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:51,326
>> Don't get sad.

1050
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,410
>> Oh, I'm not sad.

1051
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,411
>> All right, I'm just telling

1052
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:54,412
you.

1053
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:55,330
We've got to figure out.

1054
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,164
Me... maybe me, you, and Jess,

1055
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,165
we'll figure it out, yeah?

1056
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,082
>> Mm-hmm.

1057
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,125
>> All right.

1058
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,376
>> Me, Jessica, and Rocky are

1059
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,836
really tight.

1060
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,422
We can swing the whole thing.

1061
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,097
>> And Michelle... Michelle,

1062
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,850
she's a little ninja guy.

1063
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:17,143
She hangs from things, she jumps

1064
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:18,144
around, she's really physically

1065
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,979
fit, and that's what we need

1066
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,147
right now.

1067
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,106
>> I'm not getting rid of

1068
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,024
Monkey.

1069
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,233
I call her Monkey.

1070
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,238
>> Like I said, I...

1071
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,531
>> We need strong people.

1072
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,949
Rita has to go because Erica is

1073
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,159
strong.

1074
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,035
>> Erica is no joke.

1075
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,244
>> Yeah, she's, like... she's

1076
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,162
the real deal.

1077
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:36,371
So...

1078
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,164
>> Okay?

1079
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:38,998
>> Yeah.

1080
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:39,999
>> All right?

1081
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,042
All right, and what a tangled

1082
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,044
web we weave.

1083
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:46,422
It just sucks, Jess, because I

1084
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:47,840
don't want to get rid of

1085
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:48,800
anybody.

1086
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:49,550
>> I know.

1087
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,259
I feel bad, too.

1088
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,052
>> I don't want to get rid of

1089
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:51,594
anybody, but it's the game,

1090
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,095
right?

1091
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,846
What are you going to do?

1092
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,639
>> We just have to stick

1093
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:55,348
together.

1094
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,432
>> We will.

1095
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,434
I just feel so safe with Rocky.

1096
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,145
I feel good now that I know it's

1097
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,355
not me, because I was working on

1098
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,064
that puzzle.

1099
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,483
We lost on the puzzle.

1100
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,984
>> We're thinking Jessica.

1101
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,194
>> Who?

1102
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,445
>> Jessica.

1103
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,238
>> She's dispensable.

1104
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,281
Her third puzzle was hers.

1105
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:13,491
>> I mean, I hear you that

1106
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:14,784
point.

1107
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:15,368
But could the third one have

1108
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,119
been harder?

1109
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,245
Was it harder?

1110
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,121
>> They were all same.

1111
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,789
>> They were all kind of the

1112
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,581
same?

1113
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,290
>> Yeah.

1114
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,375
>> That's a valid point.

1115
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,961
>> It's over here, right?

1116
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,261
>> I will.

1117
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,887
>> That way I know, all right?

1118
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:35,847
>> I will, because me, you and

1119
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,806
Erica are going to stick

1120
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:37,682
together.

1121
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:38,891
>> Yeah.

1122
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,059
>> I will tell you.

1123
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,019
>> We were all kind of pointing

1124
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:42,311
at Jessica.

1125
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,105
We all adore her.

1126
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,691
It's nothing personality-wise.

1127
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,490
I get along super good with her.

1128
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,283
So I'm kind of hurting to have

1129
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,075
to do that.

1130
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,118
>> My concern is to really keep

1131
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,703
all the strong guys.

1132
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,246
>> I would say Rita's stronger

1133
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,415
than Jessica.

1134
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:05,042
She is.

1135
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,255
>> I have, too.

1136
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:09,756
>> Just don't think on a

1137
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,132
personal level.

1138
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,550
Just think the next challenge.

1139
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:13,301
>> Dude, this is business.

1140
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,094
>> They just came to a

1141
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,930
conclusion that Jessica has to

1142
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,098
be voted out.

1143
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:19,640
I... I won't write Jessica's

1144
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,309
name down.

1145
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,645
I'm not going to do it.

1146
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,150
>> Who?

1147
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,485
How do you know that?

1148
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,903
And how did that come about?

1149
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:32,904
>> I don't know how it came

1150
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:33,738
about.

1151
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:34,489
I just know it.

1152
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,323
>> Just tell me who you heard it

1153
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,657
from.

1154
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,700
Huh?

1155
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:38,284
Everybody?

1156
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:41,078
Well, I'm not putting her name

1157
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:41,287
down.

1158
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,706
I won't put her name down.

1159
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,833
>> Me neither.

1160
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,718
>> Tribal council tonight will

1161
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,178
be interesting.

1162
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,596
Everybody's nervous, and you

1163
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,306
still wonder in the back of your

1164
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,724
mind-- like, it might be you.

1165
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,143
Always keep your guard up.

1166
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,186
You never know when people are

1167
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,313
trying to trick you.

1168
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:08,481
It's a lot of actors here, a lot

1169
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:09,982
of poker faces.

1170
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,568
This is my poker face.

1171
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,358
>> PROBST: Go ahead and grab a

1172
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,193
torch.

1173
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,444
Approach the flame.

1174
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:58,281
Dip it in, get fire.

1175
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,203
This is part of the ritual of

1176
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:04,579
tribal council.

1177
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,581
As long as you have fire, you're

1178
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:07,623
still in the game.

1179
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:08,749
When your fire is gone, so are

1180
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:09,417
you.

1181
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,628
Take a seat.

1182
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,302
Michelle, how frustrating is it

1183
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,262
right now to know that there are

1184
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:24,390
nine people sleeping peacefully

1185
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:27,226
in a shelter you helped build?

1186
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,437
>> It was a frustrating thought

1187
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,605
at first, but I think it's okay

1188
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,689
now.

1189
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,065
We actually really like our new

1190
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,233
island.

1191
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:34,859
>> PROBST: I can't wait to hear

1192
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,235
how you've turned this in your

1193
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:36,444
head.

1194
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,237
Erica, what's so great about

1195
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,780
the new island that you don't

1196
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:40,865
miss the old one?

1197
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,366
>> We have an abundance of

1198
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,451
coconut.

1199
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,786
>> PROBST: 36 days left.

1200
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:46,829
You better have a lot of

1201
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,080
coconuts.

1202
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:48,664
>> I mean, it's not a fantasy

1203
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:49,248
land.

1204
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,459
The reality is, we don't have

1205
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,835
fire.

1206
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,045
And without the fire, we don't

1207
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:54,337
have water.

1208
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,421
You know, and I'm glad everybody

1209
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,298
has themselves together, and

1210
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,299
we're going to make it work.

1211
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,258
But it's going to take hard

1212
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,426
work.

1213
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,427
And it starts immediately.

1214
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,304
>> PROBST: James, how big of an

1215
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,472
advantage is it for the other

1216
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:08,267
tribe to not only have shelter,

1217
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,269
but to have fire, to have water?

1218
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,479
>> I think they have a huge

1219
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,439
advantage right now, but I think

1220
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:14,315
this group's got something

1221
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:14,523
special.

1222
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,317
I think we're going to rise

1223
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:16,901
above and hopefully knock them

1224
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,235
off their perch the next time we

1225
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,111
go against them in the

1226
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:19,362
challenge.

1227
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,405
>> PROBST: So now you've got to

1228
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,659
vote somebody out.

1229
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,118
You haven't had much time really

1230
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,453
to even assess why you would

1231
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,621
keep somebody or why you would

1232
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,664
get rid of somebody.

1233
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,165
So Erica, what do you use for

1234
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:32,291
the criteria?

1235
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,417
>> I think we're going to fall

1236
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,335
behind if we lose another

1237
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,544
challenge.

1238
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,088
We know everybody has something

1239
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:37,713
good to offer, but somebody has

1240
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,298
to go.

1241
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:42,134
>> PROBST: Yau-Man, you've got

1242
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,344
to be a little concerned, with

1243
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,720
all due respect, simply due to

1244
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,055
age.

1245
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:46,681
>> Yes, I feel very vulnerable,

1246
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,641
because I'm not... physically

1247
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:49,392
not the strongest one.

1248
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,310
And in order to win the next

1249
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,520
challenge, I want to keep all

1250
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,479
the strong guys.

1251
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:54,522
And if everybody thinks like

1252
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,523
that, I think I'm going to be a

1253
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,359
target, and I hope they don't.

1254
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,444
>> PROBST: Mookie, will this

1255
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:01,529
tribe be better after tonight's

1256
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:05,157
vote?

1257
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,325
>> It's hard to say.

1258
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,869
I think my vote's based upon

1259
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,371
whether that person can be

1260
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,372
replaced by Sylvia.

1261
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,374
Does she or he contribute enough

1262
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:16,377
or more than Sylvia would?

1263
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,546
>> PROBST: Rocky, do you think

1264
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,172
the person voted out tonight

1265
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,340
will be surprised?

1266
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,800
>> Yeah.

1267
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:23,718
I think so.

1268
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:24,468
I think so.

1269
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,511
I think so.

1270
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:26,679
Because I know if I'm voted off,

1271
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:27,763
I'm surprised.

1272
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:28,681
I'm sure if anybody here,

1273
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:29,557
surprise, too.

1274
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,017
So yeah, I bet there will be a

1275
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,184
big surprise coming up real

1276
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,769
soon.

1277
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:34,520
>> PROBST: Rita, if it's you

1278
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:36,397
tonight, do you understand why

1279
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,481
they would get rid of you?

1280
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,983
>> I would be very surprised.

1281
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:39,525
Because I think that I am

1282
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:40,067
contributing for us to get

1283
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,986
ahead.

1284
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,237
But I would understand.

1285
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,739
>> PROBST: Mookie, if it's you,

1286
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:45,364
would you understand?

1287
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,825
>> No, I would not understand.

1288
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,243
>> PROBST: Jessica, would you

1289
00:38:49,326 --> 00:38:49,577
understand?

1290
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,245
>> No.

1291
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:52,329
I mean, if I had been laying on

1292
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:52,913
the beach, you know, getting

1293
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,582
some sun and just relaxing, then

1294
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,167
maybe, yes, but no.

1295
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,418
>> PROBST: Okay, it is time to

1296
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,128
vote.

1297
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,797
Michelle, you're up.

1298
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:22,860
>> I'm sorry.

1299
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,528
This wasn't my idea.

1300
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,303
>> Sorry.

1301
00:39:49,386 --> 00:39:49,762
Nothing personal here.

1302
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,680
This is strictly mercenary.

1303
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:52,598
I'm trying to stay alive to

1304
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,683
fight another day.

1305
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:15,788
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1306
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:18,415
votes.

1307
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:29,593
Once the vote are read, the

1308
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,678
decision is final.

1309
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:31,720
The person voted out will be

1310
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:32,680
asked to leave the tribal

1311
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,806
council area immediately.

1312
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:34,473
I'll read the votes.

1313
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:39,603
First vote, Mookie.

1314
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:46,694
Rita.

1315
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,740
Jessica.

1316
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,036
Yau-Man.

1317
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,538
That's one vote each for Jessica

1318
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,748
Mookie, Rita, and Yau Man.

1319
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,170
Jessica.

1320
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:07,089
Two vote Jessica.

1321
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:10,217
Three votes Jessica.

1322
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,724
First person voted out of

1323
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,393
<i>Survivor: Fiji,</i> Jessica.

1324
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:20,769
That's four, that's enough.

1325
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,771
You need to bring me your torch.

1326
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,740
Jessica, the tribe has spoken.

1327
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,006
>> PROBST: Well, nearly half the

1328
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,674
tribe got at least one vote.

1329
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:51,884
Going to be a lot of people

1330
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:52,760
wondering what they did to earn

1331
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:53,928
a vote and what they can do

1332
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,012
tomorrow to make sure it doesn't

1333
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,180
happen again.

1334
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,223
Because you do not have fire,

1335
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,432
you will not be taking your

1336
00:41:58,515 --> 00:41:59,308
torches back with you.

1337
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:00,309
Grab your stuff.

1338
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:01,310
Head back to camp.

1339
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:03,020
Good night.

1340
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,368
>> PROBST: stay tuned for scenes

1341
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,453
from our next episode.

1342
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,167
>> PROBST: Next time

1343
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,168
on<i> Survivor:</i>

1344
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,336
>> Water.

1345
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:27,878
Just lick some leafs, man.

1346
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,130
>> Ravu gets weaker.

1347
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:30,756
>> I'm starving, I'm thirsty.

1348
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:34,093
>> Earl gets primal.

1349
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,552
>> Sorry there, buddy-- I can't

1350
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:36,428
take that chance.

1351
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,805
>> Boo, be careful.

1352
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,098
>> PROBST: And Boo's luck...

1353
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,099
>> I need some medical.

1354
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,100
I get injured a lot.

1355
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:41,976
>> PROBST: ...runs out.

1356
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,143
>> Boo will hurt himself out of

1357
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,062
the game.

1358
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,942
>> I guess if you're going to

1359
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,402
get back-stabbed, it's good to

1360
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:51,986
get it done in the beginning

1361
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,779
when you don't know people that

1362
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:54,905
well.

1363
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:55,781
I was absolutely shocked.

1364
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:56,907
I felt like I worked really

1365
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:57,783
hard.

1366
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:58,701
So I don't know where I went

1367
00:42:58,784 --> 00:42:59,618
wrong.

1368
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:00,911
I feel honored to have been able

1369
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:01,745
to play a game that not many

1370
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:02,830
people get to play.

1371
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,832
My torch may have been snuffed

1372
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:05,708
here, but I'm sure it's being

1373
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,793
lit somewhere else.
