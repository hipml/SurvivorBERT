translated to english from Addic7ed french: translatesubtitles.com

2
00:00:02,472 --> 00:00:04,983
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:04,983 --> 00:00:06,245
Throw away your bandanas!

4
00:00:06,245 --> 00:00:08,748
We change things.

5
00:00:08,748 --> 00:00:10,617
After a surprise change,

6
00:00:10,617 --> 00:00:15,151
Kelly was the only Blue 
in a tribe that was undermanned.

7
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:17,243
I'm terrified.

8
00:00:17,243 --> 00:00:21,161
The other Blues 
enjoyed a 4-3 advantage.

9
00:00:21,161 --> 00:00:23,106
But not everyone was happy.

10
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,766
I think 
my former teammates suck.

11
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:29,561
But I have 3 new people. 
It's a brand new game.

12
00:00:29,793 --> 00:00:33,009
On the camp, Joaquin 
and Rodney grew closer.

13
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:35,536
Rodney looks 
like my buddies back home.

14
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:36,982
I'm so glad to have you.

15
00:00:36,982 --> 00:00:38,568
These people fear a lot.

16
00:00:38,568 --> 00:00:42,139
Sierra was looking to 
distance herself from the old Blues.

17
00:00:42,139 --> 00:00:44,429
I want to go 
where I am wanted.

18
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:46,502
And I don't think it's 
with the Bleus de Travail.

19
00:00:47,274 --> 00:00:49,220
At the last immunity test...

20
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:52,224
Escameca wins immunity!

21
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,904
Away from the council!

22
00:00:53,904 --> 00:00:55,962
...Nagarote failed to follow.

23
00:00:55,962 --> 00:00:57,244
Bon sang!

24
00:00:57,244 --> 00:00:58,945
Approaching the board...

25
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:02,758
Allies Max and Shirin 
clashed

26
00:01:02,758 --> 00:01:05,388
for the title 
of the most annoying team member.

27
00:01:05,388 --> 00:01:06,903
Is it a plantar wart?

28
00:01:06,903 --> 00:01:08,419
Yeah. Sorry, that's disgusting.

29
00:01:08,419 --> 00:01:11,613
Who is the most painful? 
It's like a horse race.

30
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,898
Is it Shirin? No, here is Max 
and his plantar wart!

31
00:01:15,418 --> 00:01:17,870
And at the council, Max prevailed...

32
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,644
Fifth person eliminated...

33
00:01:19,644 --> 00:01:22,189
...leaving Shirin isolated.

34
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:24,159
Max, the tribe has spoken.

35
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:28,442
There are 13 left. 
Who will be eliminated tonight?

36
00:01:45,066 --> 00:01:47,185
The advice 
was shocking to me.

37
00:01:47,185 --> 00:01:48,902
Max was my friend

38
00:01:48,902 --> 00:01:51,766
and my closest ally.

39
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:53,864
It was a complete surprise.

40
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,954
And it's heartbreaking.

41
00:01:55,954 --> 00:01:58,451
So you won't work 
with me from now on?

42
00:01:59,647 --> 00:02:01,149
I don't know Shirin.

43
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:02,888
I don't know 
if I can trust you.

44
00:02:03,162 --> 00:02:06,190
Day after day, 
you only spoke with Max.

45
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,629
'Cause he 
always drew me aside to talk,

46
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,313
especially here, he was freaking out.

47
00:02:10,313 --> 00:02:11,381
Non, Shirin.

48
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,920
You were his puppet.

49
00:02:13,276 --> 00:02:14,962
You treated me 
like a nobody,

50
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:16,739
we've been here three days.

51
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:19,621
- I was spending time with them. 
- Exactly.

52
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:21,851
Why ? To recruit them?

53
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:23,303
- I thought we were friends. 
- To ensure a majority.

54
00:02:23,303 --> 00:02:25,257
OK. Well, when I think of loyalty,

55
00:02:25,257 --> 00:02:27,937
I think true loyalty, 
not false loyalty.

56
00:02:28,242 --> 00:02:30,322
Is there anyone 
left who wants to play with me?

57
00:02:30,322 --> 00:02:32,434
I do not believe.

58
00:02:32,434 --> 00:02:36,810
Sad observation. Is it me, 
is it my personality?

59
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,542
What should I change?

60
00:02:40,571 --> 00:02:44,069
You must be a little 
shaken up from last night.

61
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:46,717
Yes. I really thought 
it would be Will and...

62
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:48,512
- It was hard. 
- Yeah.

63
00:02:48,512 --> 00:02:52,806
Max did things 
that annoyed everyone.

64
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:54,875
And to be frank,

65
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,726
you also do annoying things.

66
00:02:57,726 --> 00:02:59,487
It's really hard for me,

67
00:02:59,487 --> 00:03:03,396
because the position in which 
I constantly find myself here

68
00:03:03,396 --> 00:03:06,823
reminds me of 
what I experienced in my childhood.

69
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:09,920
I grew up in a wealthy 
suburb of Orange County.

70
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,262
My classmates were 
mostly handsome and thin.

71
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:16,994
I was out of place, 
being neither.

72
00:03:16,994 --> 00:03:20,863
I constantly felt like 
I was fighting to be liked,

73
00:03:20,863 --> 00:03:23,150
so that we can see...

74
00:03:23,735 --> 00:03:25,288
The good qualities in me.

75
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:30,305
And there's probably 
quite a bit of that here.

76
00:03:30,305 --> 00:03:34,023
But I'm trying to do now 
what I couldn't do then,

77
00:03:34,023 --> 00:03:36,292
to know how to manage the situation,

78
00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:38,532
adapt, fix things.

79
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,666
It was the fourth day 
I had to go in the water.

80
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,637
And a wave swept away my underpants.

81
00:04:18,437 --> 00:04:19,554
Plus the briefs.

82
00:04:19,554 --> 00:04:20,942
It was a sticky thing!

83
00:04:20,942 --> 00:04:23,673
It was not a tight thing, 
nor a thong!

84
00:04:23,673 --> 00:04:25,950
It didn't 
fit in my ass, OK!

85
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,433
I'm on this beach 
with the same people,

86
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:31,822
who tell 
the same bullshit over and over again.

87
00:04:31,822 --> 00:04:33,144
It's really depressing.

88
00:04:33,144 --> 00:04:36,022
I was hoping for a mixture to 
find a new energy,

89
00:04:36,022 --> 00:04:38,868
maybe finding myself with people 
who I know look like me.

90
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:41,634
- Always the same faces, fed up! 
- Yeah.

91
00:04:41,634 --> 00:04:44,776
The same stories 
over and over again.

92
00:04:44,776 --> 00:04:47,775
We gotta stick together 
if we wanna stay sane.

93
00:04:47,775 --> 00:04:50,708
I was really happy 
that Joaq was one of the new ones.

94
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,675
Because clearly, no one binds 
to the kid from the east coast!

95
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:56,376
You got a bigot from Texas,

96
00:04:56,376 --> 00:04:57,637
a hick from Maine,

97
00:04:57,637 --> 00:04:59,594
another one from Utah...

98
00:04:59,594 --> 00:05:02,797
I was waiting 
for some form of link in this game.

99
00:05:02,797 --> 00:05:06,616
I was looking for a friendship, 
a friend to hang out with.

100
00:05:06,616 --> 00:05:07,753
Listen.

101
00:05:07,753 --> 00:05:10,055
I don't think I can 
trust Mike.

102
00:05:10,055 --> 00:05:11,983
He's from the South, he goes 
to church every Sunday.

103
00:05:11,983 --> 00:05:13,764
- Do you do that? No. 
- Nope.

104
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:16,010
- And the relaxation of Sunday, then? 
- Yeah.

105
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,651
- [???] 
- Exactly.

106
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,580
- He doesn't fuck. 
- It's not true !

107
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,605
He is single. He doesn't fuck.

108
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:24,278
- Kind for eight years. 
- You kidding.

109
00:05:24,278 --> 00:05:25,756
I swear to God.

110
00:05:25,756 --> 00:05:27,368
So what do we have in common?

111
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,537
You don't drink, 
you don't party...

112
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,442
Bon sang ...

113
00:05:30,442 --> 00:05:31,539
Joaquin, at this point,

114
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,436
he's someone 
I can work with.

115
00:05:33,436 --> 00:05:36,592
We like girls, we like to have fun,

116
00:05:36,592 --> 00:05:38,567
party, don't settle down...

117
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:39,745
We're developing 
a relationship, bro.

118
00:05:39,745 --> 00:05:41,099
Exactly.

119
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:42,953
We are day and night.

120
00:05:42,953 --> 00:05:44,097
It's obvious, isn't it?

121
00:05:44,097 --> 00:05:45,629
It's clear.

122
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:47,188
And you know...

123
00:05:47,188 --> 00:05:49,237
I knew it the first moment.

124
00:05:49,237 --> 00:05:51,387
If we work a lot, 
we will party even more.

125
00:05:51,387 --> 00:05:52,376
- Yeah. 
- It's simple.

126
00:05:52,376 --> 00:05:53,178
Let me tell you something.

127
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:55,058
If you make it to the end, you have my vote.

128
00:05:55,058 --> 00:05:56,612
- The same. 
- So automatically...

129
00:05:56,612 --> 00:05:58,164
I want the money 
to stay on the east coast.

130
00:05:58,164 --> 00:06:00,651
- Yeah, on the east coast! 
- Miami, you and me!

131
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:01,712
Clear, my brother!

132
00:06:01,712 --> 00:06:03,366
I will be Batman and he will be Robin.

133
00:06:03,366 --> 00:06:05,496
We may have to betray people,

134
00:06:05,496 --> 00:06:07,850
but in the meantime, 
no one knows what I'm doing.

135
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,931
All those who believe me finished, 
"he talks like a moron"...

136
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:14,310
Wait and see what I have planned!

137
00:06:25,703 --> 00:06:26,978
Over here everyone!

138
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:38,968
Escameca, discover 
the new Nagarote tribe.

139
00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:41,086
Max was eliminated at the last council.

140
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:47,152
Ready for 
today's reward event?

141
00:06:47,152 --> 00:06:48,773
- Yeah ! 
- Absolutely !

142
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:54,674
At my top, you will climb a tower, 
overcoming a series of obstacles.

143
00:06:56,036 --> 00:07:01,054
Once at the top, one by one 
you will pull sandbags

144
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:04,002
to targets below.

145
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:07,798
The first tribe 
to hit all six targets

146
00:07:11,116 --> 00:07:13,357
win the reward. 
Want to know what's at stake?

147
00:07:13,357 --> 00:07:15,130
Oh yeah!

148
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,484
Tonight, the winning tribe

149
00:07:17,484 --> 00:07:20,978
will witness a 
truly magical event.

150
00:07:20,978 --> 00:07:23,596
You will go to 
a turtle sanctuary,

151
00:07:23,596 --> 00:07:25,931
where under the stars you will look

152
00:07:25,931 --> 00:07:29,754
turtles migrate 
from the sea to the beach,

153
00:07:29,754 --> 00:07:33,814
where they were born, to lay eggs 
and perpetuate their life cycle.

154
00:07:33,814 --> 00:07:36,933
While witnessing 
this wonder of nature,

155
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:39,671
you will feast 
on beef stew,

156
00:07:39,671 --> 00:07:41,126
pasta gratin,

157
00:07:42,682 --> 00:07:44,096
- Talk to me, Jeff! 
- Come on, Jeffrey!

158
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:44,987
Talk to me !

159
00:07:44,987 --> 00:07:45,808
Hot chocolate.

160
00:07:45,908 --> 00:07:47,062
Hot chocolate ?

161
00:07:48,198 --> 00:07:49,755
- Hot chocolate ! 
- I know it's worth it.

162
00:07:49,755 --> 00:07:51,868
Escameca, you are one more.

163
00:07:51,868 --> 00:07:53,000
Someone will not participate.

164
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,256
It can't be 
the same person twice in a row.

165
00:07:56,068 --> 00:07:57,557
Dan. Take a seat on the bench.

166
00:07:57,557 --> 00:08:00,085
The others, one minute 
to get organized and we'll start.

167
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,414
OK, here we go. For the reward.

168
00:08:09,414 --> 00:08:10,825
Survivors, ready?

169
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:18,506
First step: 
climb this huge tower

170
00:08:18,506 --> 00:08:20,306
and overcome obstacles.

171
00:08:20,306 --> 00:08:22,426
Come on guys, it's good!

172
00:08:22,426 --> 00:08:24,426
Nagarote flies to the top.

173
00:08:24,426 --> 00:08:25,970
Escameca flies to the top.

174
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,215
Come on !

175
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,667
Watch your feet 
when crossing this rope bridge!

176
00:08:32,024 --> 00:08:34,266
Escameca flies over the obstacle.

177
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,442
- Its good. 
- Nagarote tries to follow.

178
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:41,762
Well, well!

179
00:08:41,762 --> 00:08:44,575
Escameca is going all out!

180
00:08:45,283 --> 00:08:48,814
When everyone is in the barrels, 
a 1st person can go up.

181
00:08:48,814 --> 00:08:50,646
Well, that's good!

182
00:08:50,646 --> 00:08:52,825
Start shooting!

183
00:08:53,578 --> 00:08:56,484
- It's Rodney for Escameca. 
- Come on Will!

184
00:08:56,484 --> 00:09:00,439
Will brings up the rear for Nagarote, 
once again.

185
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:04,003
Escameca took a nice advantage.

186
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:05,800
Rodney pulls the first sack.

187
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,341
Too short.

188
00:09:08,187 --> 00:09:09,122
Go Jenn!

189
00:09:09,122 --> 00:09:11,432
Jenn climbs to the top for Nagarote.

190
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,989
It's Rodney for Escameca,

191
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:16,781
Jenn pour Nagarote.

192
00:09:16,781 --> 00:09:18,829
- And There you go ! 
- Rodney shoots again.

193
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:23,373
Just too short. 
And this is Jenn for Nagarote.

194
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:27,601
Jenn scores 
the first point for Nagarote.

195
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,881
- Yes ! 
- Kelly is coming up now.

196
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:32,221
Nagarote took the lead.

197
00:09:36,173 --> 00:09:39,526
Rodney scores for Escameca. 
Tie, 1-1!

198
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:42,862
Now here is 
Joaquin for Escameca.

199
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:46,480
The wind is picking up, 
these bags are really going to fly!

200
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:50,424
Kelly scores for Nagarote.

201
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,576
Nagarote leads 2-1.

202
00:09:53,477 --> 00:09:54,939
Joaquin shoot.

203
00:09:56,234 --> 00:09:57,464
Just missed.

204
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,105
Hali is now riding for Nagarote.

205
00:10:02,545 --> 00:10:03,454
Nice shot.

206
00:10:03,454 --> 00:10:05,104
Joaquin scores for Escameca.

207
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,801
Tied, 2-2.

208
00:10:07,247 --> 00:10:10,048
- Come on Hali! 
- Hali is aiming for the same target.

209
00:10:10,752 --> 00:10:11,868
It missed.

210
00:10:11,868 --> 00:10:15,617
This is Sierra. 
Still tied, 2-2.

211
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:17,222
Six targets in all.

212
00:10:17,957 --> 00:10:19,812
- Sierra shoots. 
- Attractive !

213
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,419
And score the first time!

214
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:24,937
Escameca now leads, 3-2.

215
00:10:24,937 --> 00:10:26,596
This is Mike.

216
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,770
Mike aims for the nearest target.

217
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,266
Just missed.

218
00:10:33,043 --> 00:10:35,057
- Hali just misses. 
- We change !

219
00:10:35,554 --> 00:10:36,639
Hali comes back down,

220
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,071
someone will take his place.

221
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,595
It's good, it's good!

222
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:42,176
Carolyn is 
now shooting for Nagarote,

223
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:44,034
Mike for Escameca.

224
00:10:46,694 --> 00:10:50,034
And he touches! 
Escameca scores a 4th point.

225
00:10:50,034 --> 00:10:52,331
Scales men 4-2.

226
00:10:52,331 --> 00:10:53,814
Six targets in all.

227
00:10:53,814 --> 00:10:55,543
Carolyn must persevere!

228
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:58,100
Carolyn. It's gone well.

229
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,552
And it's good ! 
3rd point for Nagarote.

230
00:11:02,423 --> 00:11:04,605
- Go on ! 
- Nagarote closes the gap.

231
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:07,482
Joe is looking to score a 5th point.

232
00:11:07,482 --> 00:11:09,544
It's good, Joe!

233
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:10,753
Just missed.

234
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,845
Shirin's turn for Nagarote.

235
00:11:12,845 --> 00:11:14,640
She sits down!

236
00:11:16,014 --> 00:11:17,449
- And she scores! 
- Yes !

237
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:20,244
Tied, 4-4!

238
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:22,141
Two more targets 
for each tribe.

239
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,860
This is Will.

240
00:11:25,395 --> 00:11:27,432
Joe is still trying 
to hit a target.

241
00:11:27,432 --> 00:11:28,356
And There you go !

242
00:11:28,356 --> 00:11:30,699
Joe scores for Escameca.

243
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:33,575
- Go ahead, Tyler! 
- More than a target for Escameca.

244
00:11:33,575 --> 00:11:36,268
It scales mene 5-4.

245
00:11:36,268 --> 00:11:37,455
It's okay, Will!

246
00:11:37,455 --> 00:11:39,375
Will needs to activate.

247
00:11:41,127 --> 00:11:43,206
Will scores for Nagarote.

248
00:11:43,206 --> 00:11:44,644
New equality!

249
00:11:44,644 --> 00:11:46,842
5-5, everything is played there!

250
00:11:47,175 --> 00:11:49,124
Jenn, back for Nagarote.

251
00:11:49,124 --> 00:11:50,352
Tyler for Escameca.

252
00:11:50,352 --> 00:11:52,386
- Come on Tyler! 
- It's happening there!

253
00:11:57,308 --> 00:11:59,366
Just missed for Escameca.

254
00:11:59,366 --> 00:12:01,184
Come on Jenn, it's good!

255
00:12:01,184 --> 00:12:02,609
You can do it.

256
00:12:05,468 --> 00:12:09,360
That's it ! 
Nagarote wins the reward!

257
00:12:17,587 --> 00:12:19,400
We can win, I believe in it!

258
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,250
We can win, I believe in it!

259
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,761
We can win, I believe in it!

260
00:12:31,848 --> 00:12:35,260
An exciting event, 
and Nagarote, a great victory!

261
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,189
I think the evening 
will be special for you.

262
00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:40,724
Take your things, 
return to camp. Have a good evening !

263
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:47,928
Escameca, I have nothing for you. 
Take your things, return to camp.

264
00:12:47,928 --> 00:12:50,778
Winning the award, 
for me, is huge,

265
00:12:50,778 --> 00:12:53,995
because it gives me a chance 
to relate better to these people.

266
00:12:53,995 --> 00:12:56,223
At this point, I rather have an interest,

267
00:12:56,223 --> 00:12:58,034
because I am in the hot seat.

268
00:13:07,712 --> 00:13:09,050
Is it a pillow?

269
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:10,581
Oh my God !

270
00:13:13,163 --> 00:13:14,314
Oh my God !

271
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:18,491
Winning the award 
was splendid.

272
00:13:18,835 --> 00:13:20,453
It was David versus Goliath.

273
00:13:20,453 --> 00:13:23,047
It was enough 
to give us a slingshot

274
00:13:23,047 --> 00:13:24,671
to bring down the giant.

275
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:25,618
Cut the bread!

276
00:13:25,618 --> 00:13:27,818
- Oh my God ! 
- That, I want a piece!

277
00:13:28,122 --> 00:13:30,140
And in case that's not enough,

278
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,716
extra pasta gratin, 
tons of beef stew...

279
00:13:33,716 --> 00:13:34,764
Oh yeah !

280
00:13:34,764 --> 00:13:36,757
It was as if I had had 
my first child.

281
00:13:36,757 --> 00:13:39,693
To tell you 
how excited I was!

282
00:13:39,807 --> 00:13:41,263
Look, utensils!

283
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:45,207
Wow, there's no shortage of cheese!

284
00:13:45,421 --> 00:13:48,178
Being the outsiders, 
we were depressed.

285
00:13:48,178 --> 00:13:50,347
And then we recovered, 
and we won.

286
00:13:50,347 --> 00:13:51,947
- Hot chocolate ? 
- Thanks.

287
00:13:51,947 --> 00:13:53,130
I'll fill it up a bit.

288
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,249
The team begins to bond.

289
00:13:55,305 --> 00:13:58,208
Even Shirin, we tolerate her 
at this point.

290
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,363
It's too good.

291
00:13:59,363 --> 00:14:01,377
They eat rice, we eat beef.

292
00:14:01,377 --> 00:14:02,383
Yeah, baby!

293
00:14:02,702 --> 00:14:05,582
Rodney is going to say, 
"I would have destroyed that thing!

294
00:14:05,942 --> 00:14:07,126
I need protein!".

295
00:14:07,126 --> 00:14:08,574
What a moron !

296
00:14:08,574 --> 00:14:10,764
The reward 
clearly benefited me.

297
00:14:10,848 --> 00:14:13,929
I was excited to 
bond over a meal,

298
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,412
and maybe even throw up together, 
which didn't happen.

299
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:20,180
- Nagarote! 
- Nagarote!

300
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:23,787
And go see 
the turtles on the beach...

301
00:14:23,787 --> 00:14:24,699
Good.

302
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:26,172
Let's go see some turtles.

303
00:14:26,172 --> 00:14:28,082
Take your flashlights. 
Let's go!

304
00:14:28,514 --> 00:14:32,564
It gave me 
a human connection with them.

305
00:14:32,797 --> 00:14:35,014
It's my best chance 
to stay in the game.

306
00:14:35,434 --> 00:14:38,297
It was the same for everyone. 
We shared a magical moment.

307
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,496
Oh wow!

308
00:14:41,517 --> 00:14:43,772
Good. Here is the turtle.

309
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:45,526
They are huge!

310
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,085
Oh my God !

311
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:49,102
- Oh my God ! 
- It's the biggest one I've seen.

312
00:14:49,102 --> 00:14:50,576
How big is she!

313
00:14:50,576 --> 00:14:51,823
She comes from water.

314
00:14:51,823 --> 00:14:52,950
Big turtle.

315
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,854
She starts digging and then...

316
00:14:54,854 --> 00:14:56,545
She lays 120 eggs.

317
00:14:56,545 --> 00:14:58,915
But only one will survive.

318
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:02,039
The guide explained to us

319
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:05,292
that sea turtles move 
their huge bodies on the beach,

320
00:15:05,497 --> 00:15:08,953
dig a hole, 
lay a hundred eggs,

321
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:13,470
and that only one of these eggs 
may reach the ocean.

322
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,301
It's incredible.

323
00:15:20,537 --> 00:15:21,952
She covers them.

324
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:23,247
Yes, it covers the nest.

325
00:15:23,538 --> 00:15:26,785
It was awesome. 
I was fascinated, but also,

326
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:31,118
I realized that turtles were 
much less likely to live

327
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:32,567
than me to win Survivor.

328
00:15:32,756 --> 00:15:33,957
She jumps on the sand

329
00:15:33,957 --> 00:15:35,902
to protect the eggs 
from predators.

330
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:39,142
I already have a 
1 in 14 chance of winning a million,

331
00:15:39,142 --> 00:15:43,735
compared to a one in 100 chance 
of living. So that's cool.

332
00:15:43,938 --> 00:15:45,438
Oh my God, I did it!

333
00:15:45,902 --> 00:15:46,957
You did it !

334
00:16:01,508 --> 00:16:03,636
I was so craving 
pasta gratin!

335
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:05,916
- You have no idea. 
- So much !

336
00:16:06,087 --> 00:16:08,187
I'll bring that crab trap back.

337
00:16:08,563 --> 00:16:11,372
I'll go to the river, see 
if I can catch any fish.

338
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,160
Perfect. We have a little time.

339
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:21,052
Do you have a problem with Dan?

340
00:16:21,516 --> 00:16:23,082
I have a problem with all of them.

341
00:16:23,347 --> 00:16:25,814
The day I knew 
we were going to mingle,

342
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,589
It was the best day 
of my life, I...

343
00:16:27,851 --> 00:16:29,701
Swing my bandana.

344
00:16:29,701 --> 00:16:30,666
Really ?

345
00:16:30,921 --> 00:16:33,341
I'll give you a chance 
to get your revenge.

346
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:34,946
I am very excited.

347
00:16:35,102 --> 00:16:37,296
I'm coming here, 
and these overalls,

348
00:16:37,677 --> 00:16:39,005
it was the mess.

349
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:43,863
Sierra stood out, 
which is perfect.

350
00:16:43,863 --> 00:16:45,127
Basically it was...

351
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:46,782
"Go-y, Joaquin!

352
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:49,797
You have all the ammo." 
It was the perfect setup.

353
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:52,598
Tyler and I 
are together, you know that.

354
00:16:52,598 --> 00:16:56,158
He is the most reliable, 
honest and genuine person on this camp.

355
00:16:56,158 --> 00:16:57,061
I realize that.

356
00:16:57,061 --> 00:17:00,806
But Joe is very strong. 
We don't want it to go too far.

357
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:01,972
OK.

358
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:03,270
And you and Rodney are...

359
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,668
No kidding. Not even Rodney?

360
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:08,185
Surely not !

361
00:17:08,185 --> 00:17:10,915
He treats me with contempt 
and he's a cunning one.

362
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,638
- So... 
- There must be four of us.

363
00:17:12,806 --> 00:17:14,511
So I have to put up with Rodney?

364
00:17:14,626 --> 00:17:16,497
I think I can handle Rodney.

365
00:17:16,574 --> 00:17:18,152
We got along right away.

366
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:21,525
My former teammates suck.

367
00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:23,422
And I don't trust them. 
So...

368
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:26,198
My best contact 
so far is with Joaquin.

369
00:17:26,198 --> 00:17:27,695
He puts me at ease.

370
00:17:27,695 --> 00:17:31,096
He looks me in the face. 
He is like my friends.

371
00:17:31,096 --> 00:17:32,808
He is also close to Tyler.

372
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:36,641
And these two seem to be 
the most trustworthy

373
00:17:36,641 --> 00:17:37,918
that I have encountered.

374
00:17:38,188 --> 00:17:40,938
But Joaquin is also 
close to Rodney,

375
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:44,809
which is awful. I don't know 
if I can play with him.

376
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:47,815
You probably don't want 
anything to do with them.

377
00:17:48,253 --> 00:17:51,733
I need someone honest. 
I cling to the branches there.

378
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:54,542
How's it going, champ?

379
00:17:55,276 --> 00:17:56,605
What do you think of these guys?

380
00:17:57,652 --> 00:17:59,243
I like this company.

381
00:17:59,683 --> 00:18:00,568
It's just...

382
00:18:00,832 --> 00:18:03,375
I need to speak with Sierra. 
Is she still mad at me?

383
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,728
I know, we talked about it.

384
00:18:05,728 --> 00:18:08,167
We cannot hold a grudge.

385
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:08,974
Yeah.

386
00:18:08,974 --> 00:18:12,167
Sierra is mad at me for 
talking badly about her.

387
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:13,968
But you know what? It's a game.

388
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:16,335
The wind is turning. 
Time erases wounds.

389
00:18:16,536 --> 00:18:20,784
To win, I have to position myself well 
and see the balance of power.

390
00:18:20,885 --> 00:18:23,256
They must not know 
that we are associated with Sierra.

391
00:18:23,256 --> 00:18:24,473
- It's certain. 
- We agree ?

392
00:18:24,848 --> 00:18:26,688
- Do you have Tyler? 
- We're welded.

393
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,966
It's gonna be a walk.

394
00:18:29,381 --> 00:18:30,509
A walk.

395
00:18:30,749 --> 00:18:35,023
If it's Joaquin, Sierra, Tyler 
and I, on the same page...

396
00:18:35,023 --> 00:18:37,223
When the time comes, 
I can turn around

397
00:18:37,223 --> 00:18:38,766
and take control of the game.

398
00:18:38,766 --> 00:18:40,343
We had words, but...

399
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:42,016
Now we're going together 
to the promised land,

400
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:44,016
it will be historic.

401
00:18:44,304 --> 00:18:46,831
Historical. You can 
talk about this all your life.

402
00:18:47,097 --> 00:18:49,135
At this point, 
my position is excellent.

403
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,489
I have so many allies 
it's not even funny.

404
00:18:51,489 --> 00:18:54,521
I'm so confident that I 
can already imagine someone raising my hand,

405
00:18:54,521 --> 00:18:56,713
like when Rocky Balboa 
wins at the end.

406
00:19:06,226 --> 00:19:07,386
Let me tell you something.

407
00:19:07,645 --> 00:19:09,951
Joaq and I are like that.

408
00:19:10,325 --> 00:19:13,285
I hold it like this, 
like a yo-yo.

409
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:14,710
You understand ?

410
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:17,806
This kid will follow everything I say.

411
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:19,998
We gotta make sure we 
lose the trial

412
00:19:19,998 --> 00:19:21,533
for Joe to go first.

413
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,753
Trust me,

414
00:19:23,753 --> 00:19:25,687
I thought about it all day.

415
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:28,344
- Me too, last night. 
- All day, all night.

416
00:19:28,344 --> 00:19:31,232
Joe gone, I'll build 
trust with Joaq.

417
00:19:31,232 --> 00:19:33,295
It's my idea, 
I pitched it to Mike.

418
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:35,029
If we lose immunity on purpose

419
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:38,394
and that we eliminate Joe before the merger,

420
00:19:38,772 --> 00:19:40,013
who will oppose us?

421
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:43,357
We have all the cards 
in hand, but we have to act.

422
00:19:43,357 --> 00:19:44,572
No precipitation.

423
00:19:44,572 --> 00:19:46,574
We must first 
make sure that we lose,

424
00:19:46,781 --> 00:19:48,637
otherwise the whole plan falls apart.

425
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,445
Don't take it badly, 
but I would suffer,

426
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:52,789
if we lost.

427
00:19:56,129 --> 00:20:01,049
"I'm such a good strategist, 
so good at this game!"

428
00:20:01,298 --> 00:20:04,971
He thinks we should lose 
immunity to eliminate Joe.

429
00:20:05,115 --> 00:20:09,508
Losing on purpose 
rarely pays off in Survivor.

430
00:20:09,995 --> 00:20:12,525
But in this specific case, 
I think we have

431
00:20:12,972 --> 00:20:14,845
a very special situation.

432
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,162
My true ally is Kelly.

433
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,569
The poor thing is on the other side, 
all alone.

434
00:20:22,032 --> 00:20:23,846
But I think 
Kelly is a fighter,

435
00:20:24,102 --> 00:20:26,622
enough to find the way 
to achieve fusion.

436
00:20:26,622 --> 00:20:29,014
Especially when...

437
00:20:29,373 --> 00:20:32,230
We lose one or two 
events on purpose and we protect it.

438
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:44,755
Over here everyone!

439
00:20:54,368 --> 00:20:56,752
Ready for 
today's immunity test?

440
00:20:56,752 --> 00:20:58,842
- Yes ! 
- First of all, Joaquin...

441
00:21:05,426 --> 00:21:08,242
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

442
00:21:08,242 --> 00:21:10,147
Today we are going to 
test your memory.

443
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:14,122
It is very simple. I will 
show you a series of objects,

444
00:21:14,122 --> 00:21:15,586
in a specific order.

445
00:21:15,991 --> 00:21:18,901
When you have memorized them, 
you will pull a lever,

446
00:21:18,901 --> 00:21:21,011
drop a curtain, 
and reproduce the sequence.

447
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:26,432
The first person 
to succeed scores a point.

448
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:29,127
The first three-point tribe 
wins immunity,

449
00:21:29,127 --> 00:21:31,662
is out of the vote. 
The losers go to the council,

450
00:21:31,662 --> 00:21:35,574
where someone will be 
the sixth person eliminated.

451
00:21:35,574 --> 00:21:37,774
Escameca, you are one more.

452
00:21:37,774 --> 00:21:39,543
Who will not participate?

453
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:42,660
Good. Joaquin, 
take a seat on the bench.

454
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,861
The others, one minute to 
get organized and we'll start.

455
00:21:50,596 --> 00:21:52,524
Good. First pair, 
step forward!

456
00:21:55,553 --> 00:21:57,905
Rodney confronts Carolyn.

457
00:21:58,262 --> 00:21:59,152
Come on buddy!

458
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:00,881
Immunity is at stake.

459
00:22:02,251 --> 00:22:03,379
First run.

460
00:22:05,498 --> 00:22:06,322
Let's go.

461
00:22:11,593 --> 00:22:14,849
Carolyn raises the curtain. 
Rodney looks puzzled.

462
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:20,092
It's who will place the objects the fastest and return to the mat.

463
00:22:20,594 --> 00:22:23,523
Six objects. Lots to remember.

464
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:26,718
Carolyn, first on the mat.

465
00:22:28,802 --> 00:22:30,000
Carolyn was the first.

466
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,554
She has: brown jug, 
human skull, animal skull,

467
00:22:33,554 --> 00:22:37,072
candelabrum, candlestick 
and bottle by the sea.

468
00:22:38,198 --> 00:22:39,662
- It's just ! 
- Yes !

469
00:22:41,098 --> 00:22:43,450
Nagarote leads 1-0.

470
00:22:45,701 --> 00:22:46,638
Next pair!

471
00:22:47,842 --> 00:22:51,270
The next two 
are Sierra versus Hali.

472
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,392
You will get there, Hali!

473
00:22:52,573 --> 00:22:53,486
Let's go.

474
00:22:57,886 --> 00:22:59,702
The two raise 
the curtain together.

475
00:22:59,702 --> 00:23:02,187
Sierra returns. Hali returns.

476
00:23:02,187 --> 00:23:03,592
Who will finish first?

477
00:23:03,778 --> 00:23:05,033
And will it be fair?

478
00:23:05,188 --> 00:23:06,871
Sierra quickly places two objects.

479
00:23:07,246 --> 00:23:08,037
It's good, Sierra.

480
00:23:08,295 --> 00:23:10,198
- Hali proceeds backwards. 
- It's okay, Hali.

481
00:23:12,246 --> 00:23:13,085
Follow your instincts!

482
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:17,105
Hali thinks it's good, 
she goes to the mat.

483
00:23:19,141 --> 00:23:20,765
Hali was the first.

484
00:23:20,765 --> 00:23:23,344
She has: lantern, large candle, 
bottle in the sea,

485
00:23:23,344 --> 00:23:26,234
candlestick, candelabra and brown jug.

486
00:23:26,434 --> 00:23:29,559
Hali is right. 
Nagarote leads 2-0.

487
00:23:32,486 --> 00:23:33,838
Next pair, come closer!

488
00:23:34,782 --> 00:23:37,550
The next two 
are Joe versus Will.

489
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:41,644
Perhaps the last confrontation 
of this ordeal.

490
00:23:41,951 --> 00:23:44,282
Will can now give 
the victory to his team.

491
00:23:44,658 --> 00:23:45,486
Let's go.

492
00:23:52,442 --> 00:23:55,226
Joe pulls the lever. 
He returns, Will on his heels.

493
00:23:56,082 --> 00:23:58,812
Joe must succeed to keep 
his tribe in the game.

494
00:24:01,538 --> 00:24:03,571
Joe thinks it's good, 
he goes to his mat.

495
00:24:03,571 --> 00:24:04,748
Will is on his own.

496
00:24:05,932 --> 00:24:09,093
large candle, candle 
holder, candelabra,

497
00:24:09,093 --> 00:24:11,474
lantern, large candle, 
candelabra.

498
00:24:11,474 --> 00:24:12,034
It's just.

499
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,257
Joe is right.

500
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,591
Nagarote leads 2-1.

501
00:24:18,012 --> 00:24:19,141
We go to three points.

502
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:21,250
To the next two!

503
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,186
Program affronte Dan.

504
00:24:25,901 --> 00:24:27,846
Nagarote can win now.

505
00:24:27,846 --> 00:24:28,704
Allez Shirin!

506
00:24:34,813 --> 00:24:36,910
Dan pulls the lever and comes back.

507
00:24:37,232 --> 00:24:40,826
- Maybe the last showdown. 
- Come on Shirin!

508
00:24:41,366 --> 00:24:43,627
And progress.

509
00:24:45,762 --> 00:24:47,866
Dan thinks it's good. 
He is on his mat.

510
00:24:50,103 --> 00:24:52,831
Shirin goes to her mat. 
Dan has:

511
00:24:52,831 --> 00:24:55,444
brown jug, lantern, 
bottle in the sea,

512
00:24:55,444 --> 00:24:57,967
animal skull, 
large candle, candle holder.

513
00:24:57,967 --> 00:25:01,598
Dan is right. Tied, 2-2.

514
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,778
I suck at that.

515
00:25:09,621 --> 00:25:11,595
This time, there it is. 
The next two!

516
00:25:15,302 --> 00:25:16,801
Bring us victory!

517
00:25:16,801 --> 00:25:20,679
It's a showdown 
for victory and immunity.

518
00:25:22,732 --> 00:25:25,954
Two Labor Blues, now 
in competing tribes.

519
00:25:26,794 --> 00:25:27,841
It's good, come on!

520
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:30,253
- Breathe well! 
- Come on, Kel!

521
00:25:30,423 --> 00:25:33,549
Six objects. We are at 2-2. 
Let's go !

522
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:42,731
Kelly pulls the lever. 
Mike stands staring at a curtain.

523
00:25:43,298 --> 00:25:44,578
The curtain was closed!

524
00:25:49,766 --> 00:25:51,362
I don't know.

525
00:25:56,428 --> 00:25:57,754
Mike thinks it's good.

526
00:25:58,416 --> 00:25:59,628
Kelly thinks it's good.

527
00:25:59,628 --> 00:26:00,978
Mike se trumpet.

528
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,637
Kelly, do you think that's fair?

529
00:26:03,998 --> 00:26:05,597
- Nope. 
- Yeah. Kelly is wrong.

530
00:26:06,072 --> 00:26:07,962
Both are wrong. 
We start again.

531
00:26:08,198 --> 00:26:10,061
- Come on, Kelly! 
- It's okay, Kelly!

532
00:26:11,155 --> 00:26:13,011
It's good, it's good!

533
00:26:13,403 --> 00:26:15,934
There is a tie, 2-2.

534
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,417
Listen to me, I'll leave it to you.

535
00:26:18,417 --> 00:26:21,872
- What ? 
- Listen to me, I'll leave it to you.

536
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,767
They are the same six objects.

537
00:26:25,063 --> 00:26:26,638
Here is your second chance.

538
00:26:28,705 --> 00:26:30,765
1 and 5 are the skulls.

539
00:26:31,241 --> 00:26:32,581
Two bottles in the middle.

540
00:26:33,698 --> 00:26:35,121
And two light things.

541
00:26:36,565 --> 00:26:37,518
Kelly pulls the lever.

542
00:26:37,951 --> 00:26:39,054
Both come back.

543
00:26:40,264 --> 00:26:42,728
- Skulls in 1 and 5... 
- Six objects only,

544
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:46,110
which cause difficulties 
for two Work Blues.

545
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:49,165
Kelly tries to 
remember again

546
00:26:49,165 --> 00:26:51,021
of six simple objects.

547
00:26:51,021 --> 00:26:54,358
If you can't find it, 
we'll go down to five items.

548
00:26:54,758 --> 00:26:56,112
- Its good. 
- Michael, first on his mat.

549
00:26:56,911 --> 00:26:57,949
Kelly is on her mat.

550
00:26:59,733 --> 00:27:01,334
Mike is wrong again.

551
00:27:03,577 --> 00:27:05,231
Kelly, you shake your head.

552
00:27:05,547 --> 00:27:07,348
- Yeah, that's wrong. 
- Indeed, it is false.

553
00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:10,686
We're going to remove one object 
and go to five.

554
00:27:10,686 --> 00:27:12,165
Come, let's start again.

555
00:27:13,141 --> 00:27:14,252
Come on, Kelly!

556
00:27:18,091 --> 00:27:20,608
Let's go. 
Six items was too much.

557
00:27:20,608 --> 00:27:22,224
We go down to five.

558
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:26,155
I'll say the order out loud 
and reverse the bottles.

559
00:27:26,404 --> 00:27:27,252
Let's go.

560
00:27:28,238 --> 00:27:29,934
Skulls: 1 and 5.

561
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:32,531
- The two bottles and the candelabra. 
- Its good.

562
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,524
Mike pulls the lever. 
Five objects this time.

563
00:27:37,524 --> 00:27:39,014
Someone will do well!

564
00:27:39,014 --> 00:27:40,205
I'm confident !

565
00:27:40,524 --> 00:27:42,340
Look at mine 
and reverse the bottles.

566
00:27:43,082 --> 00:27:45,604
It's like they're waiting 
for each other to hit the mat

567
00:27:45,604 --> 00:27:46,604
and ease their suffering.

568
00:27:50,422 --> 00:27:51,273
Its good.

569
00:27:52,273 --> 00:27:54,898
Mike reached his mat 
just before Kelly,

570
00:27:54,898 --> 00:27:56,200
but he is wrong.

571
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,475
Kelly has: 
human skull, brown jug,

572
00:27:59,475 --> 00:28:02,318
bottle in the sea, 
candelabra, animal skull.

573
00:28:02,702 --> 00:28:05,740
If Kelly is right, 
Nagarote wins immunity,

574
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,141
is shielded from the board.

575
00:28:07,315 --> 00:28:08,491
Are you sure of yourself?

576
00:28:09,489 --> 00:28:12,819
And you're right. 
Nagarote wins immunity,

577
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,303
sending Escameca to the council,

578
00:28:15,303 --> 00:28:18,709
where someone will be 
the sixth person eliminated.

579
00:28:24,241 --> 00:28:26,250
Nagarote, congratulations!

580
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:28,804
Big win, 
no advice tonight.

581
00:28:29,464 --> 00:28:30,307
Give it to Hali!

582
00:28:31,637 --> 00:28:32,453
Yeah, baby!

583
00:28:32,691 --> 00:28:34,923
Escameca, tonight, advice,

584
00:28:35,122 --> 00:28:38,320
where someone will be 
the sixth person eliminated.

585
00:28:38,488 --> 00:28:40,996
Take your things, return 
to camp. See you tonight at the council.

586
00:28:42,028 --> 00:28:44,525
When I found out that Michael 
was losing on purpose to help me,

587
00:28:44,525 --> 00:28:46,000
it was the first time in my life

588
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,539
that I completely 
trusted someone.

589
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:50,444
Without reservation. "He protects me."

590
00:28:50,642 --> 00:28:53,555
I can't wait 
to get back to my blue tribe.

591
00:28:53,555 --> 00:28:54,611
This is where I belong.

592
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,427
Head held high ! Stay proud.

593
00:29:09,427 --> 00:29:11,041
- Sorry. 
- No, no need to be sorry.

594
00:29:12,473 --> 00:29:14,343
You should have gone there for me.

595
00:29:14,343 --> 00:29:15,568
No, listen.

596
00:29:15,568 --> 00:29:18,582
I could have done 
the same, or worse.

597
00:29:18,582 --> 00:29:20,965
That's life. And she continues.

598
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:24,156
[???] Sorry.

599
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,770
Losing on purpose today,

600
00:29:26,984 --> 00:29:30,019
a little something 
died in me, in this game.

601
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:31,196
I won't lie to you.

602
00:29:31,804 --> 00:29:32,891
But here's the thing.

603
00:29:33,192 --> 00:29:35,183
I'm starting to get suspicious of Rodney.

604
00:29:35,183 --> 00:29:38,119
...And this girl gives me 
a very small portion of rice.

605
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,480
One to each.

606
00:29:39,646 --> 00:29:45,013
Joaquin pulls Rodney closer to him, 
more every moment.

607
00:29:45,013 --> 00:29:46,307
And in this game

608
00:29:46,307 --> 00:29:48,612
when you show yourself 
very close to someone,

609
00:29:48,807 --> 00:29:50,126
you become a strong pair.

610
00:29:50,127 --> 00:29:52,371
Strong pairs 
must be separated immediately,

611
00:29:52,371 --> 00:29:54,618
before you can 
make big shots.

612
00:29:57,719 --> 00:29:59,224
We need to talk.

613
00:29:59,224 --> 00:30:01,294
- Let's talk about the board. 
- OK.

614
00:30:01,526 --> 00:30:05,358
Listen. Joe leaves first. 
Joe leaves.

615
00:30:05,612 --> 00:30:07,166
Everyone is leaving.

616
00:30:07,393 --> 00:30:09,411
He doesn't suspect a thing.

617
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,147
- We'll talk later. 
- 100% safe.

618
00:30:12,147 --> 00:30:14,153
Let's pretend 
we haven't talked about strategy.

619
00:30:14,153 --> 00:30:15,192
We are already clear.

620
00:30:15,192 --> 00:30:17,286
We know what's going on.

621
00:30:17,703 --> 00:30:20,119
Today, in the test, 
we were resolved on one thing,

622
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:22,532
namely to lose it. 
Mission accomplished.

623
00:30:22,829 --> 00:30:25,421
Mike came across as an idiot, 
it was hilarious.

624
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,094
But it worked perfectly.

625
00:30:27,094 --> 00:30:29,128
Now we have to get Joe out.

626
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:30,543
He is dangerous.

627
00:30:31,016 --> 00:30:32,056
So he will leave.

628
00:30:36,812 --> 00:30:37,563
Hey, my brother!

629
00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:39,220
We can't lose Sierra.

630
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:40,749
Sierra is crucial.

631
00:30:41,004 --> 00:30:43,481
- Listen. This game is for us. 
- I say.

632
00:30:43,481 --> 00:30:45,720
I don't care about others.

633
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,210
- So if anyone... 
- We'll go all the way.

634
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:51,416
I tell you, it will be a walk.

635
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,271
Who else would you like to 
share this moment with?

636
00:30:53,528 --> 00:30:55,041
It's like the Yankees 
and the Red Sox.

637
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:56,528
I know, it's like...

638
00:30:56,528 --> 00:30:59,053
- I have so much love for you! 
- My brother ! My brother !

639
00:30:59,053 --> 00:31:00,320
It will be perfect.

640
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,393
It's gonna be perfect.

641
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:02,769
I'm really excited.

642
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:05,376
Initially, I thought it would be 
Tyler and me against the rest of the world.

643
00:31:05,777 --> 00:31:08,055
But now 
Rodney is my right arm.

644
00:31:08,582 --> 00:31:11,014
And Sierra owes me.

645
00:31:11,014 --> 00:31:14,253
She was supposed to be next, 
I pulled her out of the shit.

646
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,722
So Joe leaves.

647
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,899
And from there 
it will be a walk.

648
00:31:23,588 --> 00:31:25,044
Joe, what's your position?

649
00:31:26,098 --> 00:31:28,690
I'm up for anything.

650
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:32,099
Whenever I want to speak 
with Joaquin, see where he is,

651
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:34,440
his little puppy is with him.

652
00:31:34,932 --> 00:31:38,026
I think those two 
white collars are kidding us.

653
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,185
They hooked Rodney,

654
00:31:41,185 --> 00:31:43,473
and I'm afraid they'll do Sierra

655
00:31:43,473 --> 00:31:45,098
and that we are outvoted.

656
00:31:46,103 --> 00:31:48,961
And to be honest, Rodney 
came up to me and said,

657
00:31:49,536 --> 00:31:52,070
"We have to fire Joe first."

658
00:31:52,228 --> 00:31:55,092
I was hoping to approach 
Tyler and Joaquin,

659
00:31:55,092 --> 00:31:56,843
but they don't speak to me.

660
00:31:57,213 --> 00:31:59,918
I thought 
we could collaborate,

661
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,223
but apparently 
they're targeting me, so...

662
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:03,498
I'm fucked, basically.

663
00:32:03,498 --> 00:32:06,426
When we arrived, 
it was Sierra, Sierra, Sierra.

664
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,366
We thought she was on the sidelines.

665
00:32:08,678 --> 00:32:11,143
- She was. 
- She's still mad at Dan.

666
00:32:11,686 --> 00:32:15,397
Underlying problem: 
she's really not happy.

667
00:32:15,397 --> 00:32:17,093
And I got down on my stomach.

668
00:32:17,093 --> 00:32:19,796
But I think until 
his name comes out,

669
00:32:19,796 --> 00:32:21,309
she will accept everything.

670
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,810
At this point, 
my options are limited.

671
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,441
You have to make the best 
of the worst-case scenario.

672
00:32:28,392 --> 00:32:29,422
Hoping it works.

673
00:32:29,957 --> 00:32:31,585
Sierra would be the key.

674
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:33,126
Yup.

675
00:32:33,846 --> 00:32:35,237
If we had Sierra,

676
00:32:36,192 --> 00:32:37,354
on virerait Joaquin.

677
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:40,453
At this point, Joe is with us.

678
00:32:40,714 --> 00:32:44,152
Alas, Sierra and I, 
we really clashed.

679
00:32:44,482 --> 00:32:46,259
I screwed up, hands down.

680
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:48,924
No excuses, no procrastination.

681
00:32:48,924 --> 00:32:52,365
I screwed up. And now 
we have to bring her back to us.

682
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,756
Seeing Rodney with Joaquin...

683
00:33:00,473 --> 00:33:02,252
These two need to be separated.

684
00:33:02,764 --> 00:33:06,406
Listen, I screwed up. 
I want to regain your trust.

685
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,039
But you worried us.

686
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,788
We eliminated her best friend 
because they were too close.

687
00:33:11,933 --> 00:33:13,579
And we have to do the same.

688
00:33:14,434 --> 00:33:15,553
Joaquin leaves first.

689
00:33:15,955 --> 00:33:16,813
OK ?

690
00:33:17,668 --> 00:33:20,908
At this point, I have 
two alliances telling me:

691
00:33:20,908 --> 00:33:23,036
"Come with us, 
we'll take care of you."

692
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:26,504
And it's nice, 
it's refreshing to be desired.

693
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:31,318
But my old tribe 
made me suffer a lot,

694
00:33:31,581 --> 00:33:33,220
and now they need me?

695
00:33:33,507 --> 00:33:35,073
It makes me want to vomit.

696
00:33:35,345 --> 00:33:36,931
Joe would vote for Joaquin.

697
00:33:37,411 --> 00:33:39,506
As long as it's not him, 
he's fine.

698
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:42,130
Rodney, on the first vote,

699
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:45,553
with the three of us and Joe, 
we remain in the majority.

700
00:33:45,637 --> 00:33:47,413
But as soon as we get Joaquin,

701
00:33:47,413 --> 00:33:49,549
Rodney is going to explode.

702
00:33:50,413 --> 00:33:51,486
Let it explode!

703
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,406
Just... shut your mouth, 
open your ears,

704
00:33:55,406 --> 00:33:56,820
and see what happens.

705
00:33:57,175 --> 00:33:59,464
I hate Dan. And at this point,

706
00:33:59,464 --> 00:34:01,217
I'm just very angry.

707
00:34:01,432 --> 00:34:04,985
The Blues don't care about me, 
they won't keep me.

708
00:34:04,985 --> 00:34:06,561
They are using me 
for this occasion.

709
00:34:06,817 --> 00:34:08,337
- Everyone votes Joe. 
- OK.

710
00:34:08,553 --> 00:34:10,639
- Everybody. 
- I am with you.

711
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:11,725
What do you say ?

712
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:16,354
I'm the type to play 
with my heart and my head.

713
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,987
Of course, in this game, 
it will get me in trouble.

714
00:34:19,478 --> 00:34:21,341
At this point, yes, 
I have it both ways.

715
00:34:21,341 --> 00:34:24,340
I don't know... 
not only who to trust,

716
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,098
but also who will be best 
in the long run.

717
00:34:26,553 --> 00:34:29,066
I can choose a path 
that will perhaps lead me to the final.

718
00:34:29,066 --> 00:34:30,066
We never know.

719
00:34:30,066 --> 00:34:34,507
And at this point, I don't know 
yet which path I'm going to follow.

720
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,786
But either way, 
it could turn the game upside down.

721
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,930
Good. After mixing, 
we end up with

722
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:07,469
three Overalls, 
two White Collars and one Colorless.

723
00:35:07,469 --> 00:35:09,174
Joe, arriving at the camp,

724
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:13,415
it seemed that the Blues were 
very happy to be together

725
00:35:13,415 --> 00:35:14,966
in this random redistribution?

726
00:35:15,188 --> 00:35:19,387
On the surface, it looked like 
a happy, united family.

727
00:35:19,387 --> 00:35:21,594
But every family is imperfect.

728
00:35:21,594 --> 00:35:23,715
There are quarrels, breaches,

729
00:35:24,018 --> 00:35:27,475
and Joaquin, Tyler and I 
tried to find them

730
00:35:27,755 --> 00:35:30,024
- and exploit them. 
- Dan.

731
00:35:30,024 --> 00:35:34,777
Did you feel that these three 
were looking for the flaw?

732
00:35:35,065 --> 00:35:38,278
Yes, there may have been 
opportunities to exploit.

733
00:35:38,278 --> 00:35:40,578
From there to talk about flaws...

734
00:35:40,795 --> 00:35:43,435
Let's not beat around the bush, 
there are malfunctions.

735
00:35:43,752 --> 00:35:45,711
So I'm concerned.

736
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:49,405
Tyler, what are you looking for? 
What are you trying to take into account?

737
00:35:49,405 --> 00:35:51,342
Honestly, Jeff, 
I didn't have to do anything.

738
00:35:51,569 --> 00:35:54,451
We found bad vibes 
and animosity.

739
00:35:54,454 --> 00:35:57,565
And it seems to 
revolve a lot around Sierra.

740
00:35:58,454 --> 00:36:00,896
- Sierra, is it true? 
- Absolutely.

741
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,719
After the last advice, 
I was mistreated.

742
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:05,936
I was told that I was 
useless in the tests,

743
00:36:05,936 --> 00:36:07,512
that I did nothing on the camp...

744
00:36:07,712 --> 00:36:10,496
Everything that I could be reproached for, 
I have been reproached for.

745
00:36:10,496 --> 00:36:11,874
We haven't all 
blamed you.

746
00:36:11,874 --> 00:36:14,923
When it happened, 
Mike stood up and said:

747
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:17,915
"guys, that's enough", 
I admit.

748
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,156
But I felt more 
appreciated in 24 hours

749
00:36:21,156 --> 00:36:25,286
with these people than in 11 days 
with these three.

750
00:36:25,878 --> 00:36:28,902
Wow. Mike, this is not good.

751
00:36:29,088 --> 00:36:33,857
You're in a situation where, 
if Sierra wants to pass,

752
00:36:33,857 --> 00:36:36,338
the game rocks, 
and Dan, Rodney and you,

753
00:36:36,338 --> 00:36:37,305
you are in trouble.

754
00:36:37,305 --> 00:36:39,696
Well, we four,

755
00:36:39,696 --> 00:36:42,674
we have been together 
for 16 days now.

756
00:36:42,878 --> 00:36:46,289
But I don't think 
we're a foursome

757
00:36:46,542 --> 00:36:48,490
completely impenetrable.

758
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:53,286
What if these three saw flaws 
and attracted one of us...

759
00:36:53,286 --> 00:36:56,997
Yeah, I'm definitely 
a little scared tonight, 100%.

760
00:36:57,413 --> 00:37:00,214
But Jeff, that's the beauty 
of throwing the bandanas away.

761
00:37:00,475 --> 00:37:01,842
Opportunities arise.

762
00:37:01,842 --> 00:37:03,753
There were clearly 
problems between us,

763
00:37:03,753 --> 00:37:06,073
but I have three 
new people here,

764
00:37:06,259 --> 00:37:09,254
three others with whom 
I have been with for 16 days,

765
00:37:09,254 --> 00:37:10,417
that drive me crazy...

766
00:37:10,417 --> 00:37:12,718
What will be the best 
opportunity for me?

767
00:37:13,763 --> 00:37:16,299
Joaquin, would you have imagined

768
00:37:16,299 --> 00:37:18,406
that you would be at the council, 
to say to yourself:

769
00:37:18,604 --> 00:37:21,089
"I'm not as concerned 
as I would have thought.",

770
00:37:21,089 --> 00:37:22,089
a few days ago ?

771
00:37:22,256 --> 00:37:24,400
I didn't think 
it would turn out like this, Jeff.

772
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,363
But when people 
come to see you

773
00:37:26,363 --> 00:37:29,112
and explain to you, basically, 
why they hate each other,

774
00:37:29,386 --> 00:37:31,594
it couldn't have been 
easier for me.

775
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:35,323
Joe, is a part of you 
wondering

776
00:37:35,323 --> 00:37:37,715
what is true in what they say,

777
00:37:37,715 --> 00:37:40,772
and what falls under what they 
want you to hear?

778
00:37:40,965 --> 00:37:43,548
Yes, these four can 
very well say:

779
00:37:43,548 --> 00:37:45,189
"let's eliminate them one by one".

780
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:48,529
But on a strategic level, 
I am in the worst position.

781
00:37:48,529 --> 00:37:51,087
At least Joaquin has Tyler. 
Me, I don't have anyone.

782
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:56,198
Sierra, one of the trademarks 
of the Blues,

783
00:37:56,198 --> 00:37:59,317
it was that you helped each other.

784
00:37:59,703 --> 00:38:02,059
Jeff, it wasn't having 
my name written on it.

785
00:38:02,059 --> 00:38:05,909
I was attacked 
personally on my return to the camp.

786
00:38:06,099 --> 00:38:08,052
I can't trust 
people who do that.

787
00:38:08,275 --> 00:38:10,811
But even if 
you don't love someone,

788
00:38:10,811 --> 00:38:15,147
you are four. Why not 
stick together for a few more votes?

789
00:38:15,317 --> 00:38:18,118
Yes. I'm not stupid, 
I get that.

790
00:38:18,282 --> 00:38:21,842
I made real friendships 
with some people.

791
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:25,077
So absolutely, 
I have to consider the whole

792
00:38:25,077 --> 00:38:28,061
and ask me who 
I trust at this point.

793
00:38:28,527 --> 00:38:31,065
Mike, it's kind of 
like a romantic relationship,

794
00:38:31,065 --> 00:38:34,041
and someone did something 
wrong, but you still love each other,

795
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:35,341
you want it to resume,

796
00:38:35,341 --> 00:38:37,998
but you have to work on it, 
because there's this other guy,

797
00:38:37,998 --> 00:38:39,183
and he flirts with her.

798
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:40,790
In this case, it's Sierra.

799
00:38:43,077 --> 00:38:45,063
Smiles aside, what are you doing?

800
00:38:45,063 --> 00:38:46,700
You can't just say:

801
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,219
"OK, Sierra, if you have to go, 
you have to go.".

802
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:54,226
At the end of the day, we hope 
to be able to believe in trust

803
00:38:54,226 --> 00:38:56,714
that we developed earlier,

804
00:38:56,714 --> 00:38:59,975
or in the one created 
with new friends,

805
00:38:59,975 --> 00:39:02,901
but you never know 
who you can trust

806
00:39:02,901 --> 00:39:04,636
before leaving the board.

807
00:39:04,906 --> 00:39:08,919
And it's a 
very, very scary situation, Jeff.

808
00:39:11,547 --> 00:39:14,762
It seems that the decision 
of who will leave tonight

809
00:39:14,762 --> 00:39:16,890
could be very important 
for this group.

810
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,379
It's time to vote. 
Dan, over to you.

811
00:39:32,683 --> 00:39:33,729
Sorry, buddy.

812
00:39:44,865 --> 00:39:47,633
Joaquin, looks 
like it's you or me tonight.

813
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,144
I will count the votes.

814
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:09,747
If anyone has an 
immunity idol and wants to play it,

815
00:40:09,747 --> 00:40:11,489
now is the time to do it.

816
00:40:16,509 --> 00:40:18,635
Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

817
00:40:18,635 --> 00:40:21,364
The eliminated person 
will leave the board immediately.

818
00:40:21,364 --> 00:40:22,401
I will read the votes.

819
00:40:34,246 --> 00:40:35,166
Joe.

820
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:42,133
Joaquin.

821
00:40:42,133 --> 00:40:44,310
Two votes Joe, two votes Joaquin.

822
00:40:47,725 --> 00:40:49,239
Three votes Joe.

823
00:40:51,334 --> 00:40:55,289
Joaquin. 
Three votes Joe, three votes Joaquin.

824
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:56,537
One vote remains.

825
00:40:58,691 --> 00:41:00,088
Sixth person eliminated...

826
00:41:02,238 --> 00:41:03,964
Joaquin. 
Bring me your torch.

827
00:41:18,731 --> 00:41:20,911
Joaquin, the tribe to parlé.

828
00:41:25,147 --> 00:41:25,968
It's time to go.

829
00:41:34,296 --> 00:41:37,855
Tonight 
's discussion revolved around loopholes.

830
00:41:37,855 --> 00:41:41,049
Your success in this game 
depends on your ability

831
00:41:41,049 --> 00:41:45,414
to repair or exploit 
these cracks, day after day.

832
00:41:45,414 --> 00:41:47,894
Take your things, 
return to camp. Good night.

Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

835
00:42:01,954 --> 00:42:04,234
Next time in Survivor....

836
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,284
Team up behind my back?

837
00:42:06,284 --> 00:42:08,948
Rodney feels betrayed 
by his blue family.

838
00:42:08,948 --> 00:42:12,043
Those who wronged me will pay.

839
00:42:12,043 --> 00:42:13,124
But in Survivor...

840
00:42:13,124 --> 00:42:13,929
Where's Jeff?

841
00:42:13,929 --> 00:42:15,730
...we always find 
time for revenge.

842
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,135
You merged!

843
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:20,449
These Blues disrespected me.

844
00:42:20,449 --> 00:42:21,820
So your coming 
of age is a joke.

845
00:42:26,926 --> 00:42:28,166
I didn't see it coming.

846
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,442
These four, I don't know 
which ones, got me good.

847
00:42:31,442 --> 00:42:32,632
I have my idea.

848
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:35,303
Mike must have been 
obsessed with Sierra,

849
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,750
I was getting too close 
to her and Rodney.

850
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:40,099
They must have thought 
that I was taking their tribe from them,

851
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,063
and so, "Let's get it out!".

852
00:42:42,063 --> 00:42:44,038
But it's my destiny

853
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,637
and I accept it with a smile.
