THE IDOL IS AT THE TOP OF THE
RUNG.

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,352
THERE IS A LADDER TO RETRIEVE
THE IDOL.

81
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,188

82
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,590

IMMUNITY IDOL, BUT THIS ONE IS

86
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,194
GOING TO BE A TRICKY ONE TO
FIND.

87

YOU KNOW, HOW BIG IS THIS
LADDER?

88
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:01,134
HOW TALL IS THIS ROCK?

89
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:04,404
HOW DO I GET THIS LADDER?

90
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,907
OH, MY GOSH.

91
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,511
MAKE SURE NO ONE IS COMING.

92
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:17,950

93
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,486
SO, OF COURSE, THIS LADDER IS
PROBABLY LIKE EIGHT FEET TALL.

94
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,989

THIS IS THE FINAL SIX.

00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,027
TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE, RIGHT?

98
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:32,598
SO I HIDE MY LADDER AND I WALK
BACK UP TO THE WELL, BECAUSE I

99
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:42,008
NEEDED TO SCOUT OUT THE AREA.

100
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,811
OH, MY GOD.

101
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:51,117
I REALIZE THAT THE CLUE HAS
FALLEN OUT OF MY BRA AT SOME

102
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,185
POINT.

103
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:55,121

00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:56,422

00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,765

108

IM LOOKING AROUND THE WELL.

112
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,074
THERE IS ONE HUGE ROCK WALL.

113

114
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,143
IM USING THE LADDER.

115
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,911
IM CLIMBING THIS ROCK WALL.

SO I CLIMBED TOO HIGH.

122
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,058
NOW IM STUCK.

00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,559
AND IM TRYING TO GET DOWN
SAFELY.

124
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,529
BUT ITS SUPER STEEP.

125
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,164
ITS A CLIFF.

126
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:41,634
SO I HAVE TO GET BACK DOWN SO I
CAN FIND THE IDOL AND GET OUT OF

I FEEL LIKE IM SEEING THINGS

LOOKING SO HARD.

130
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:55,014
SO THERES NO IDOL UP THERE.

131
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,249
FINALLY I BARELY MADE IT DOWN.

132
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,850

IN ADDITION YOU HAVE WON REWARD.

355
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:55,521
CHOOSE ONE PERSON TO JOIN YOU
BACK AT CAMP.

356
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:56,789
OH, GOSH.

357
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:00,025
WELL, YOU SAID THERE WOULD BE
VEGETARIAN STUFF IN THERE, IM

358
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,227
NOT GOING TO DO MUCH WITH THAT,
SO IM GOING TO PICK ANGELINA TO

359
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,630
TAKE CARE OF THAT HALF FOR ME.

360
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:09,368
ILL TAKE CARE OF THE MEAT.

361
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:10,602
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

362
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,571
YOU HAVE ONE MORE CHOICE INCH
DOING SO, YOURE GOING TO BRING

363
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:14,406
ONE PERSON WITH YOU.

364
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,607
IM A VEGETARIAN, TOO.

365
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,909
Jeff: YOU WILL BRING THREE
PEOPLE WITH YOU, THREE PEOPLE

366
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:21,347
WILL BE LEFT BACK AT CAMP.

367
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,349
IM TELLING HIM, HE DOESNT
NEED TO PICK ME.

368
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,652
HE ALREADY PICKED ME FOR THE
FAMILY VISIT.

369
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,555
I DO APPRECIATE YOU SAYING,
THAT DAVIE.

370
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,123
WITH THAT CASE, IM GOING TO
HAVE TO CHOOSE MIKE.

371
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:36,395
IM SORRY TO
 Jeff: MY JABENI CREW.

372
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:37,396
THANK YOU.

373
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:40,966
Jeff: ALISON, THIS IS
BECOMING A COMMON STORY.

374
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,901
ONCE AGAIN NOT CHOSEN.

375
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:49,375
YOU KNOW, IM CLAWING MY WAY
THROUGH THIS GAME, AND IM VERY

376
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:49,875
HUNGRY RIGHT NOW.

377
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:50,943
THEY ALL KNOW THAT.

378
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:53,879
IM A BAG OF BONES, BUT IM
STILL HERE, SO IM STILL

379
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:54,380
SMILING.

380
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:55,080
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

381
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,882
HERES WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN.

382
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,651
NICK, BACK AT CAMP, YOU,
ANGELINA, AND MIKE WILL ENJOY

383
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:04,923
SPAGHETTI, MEAT AND VEGETARIAN,
GARLIC BREAD, CAKE, WINE.

384
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,526
ALISON, KARA, DAVIE, NOTHING FOR
YOU.

385
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:11,530
THE BIGGER PICTURE, TRIBAL
COUNCIL TONIGHT, WHERE ONE OF

386
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,932
THE FIVE OF YOU WILL BE VOTED
OUT.

387
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:14,533
IT WONT BE YOU.

388
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:15,034
CONGRATS.

389
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:15,868
THANK YOU, JEFF.

390
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,436
NO GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

391
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:23,008
IT WAS CRUSHING TO LOSE AND
NOT GO ON REWARD BECAUSE IM

392
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,344
JUST THE PERSON LEFT BEHIND
EVERY TIME.

393
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:31,383
GOD, IT IS HARD TO CONSTANTLY BE
THE ONE IN THE CROSS-FIRE.

394
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,804
BEAUTIFUL.

395
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:56,608
I WALK INTO THE REWARD, AND
WHERE ARE WE BUT THE WATERWELL.

396
00:17:56,642 --> 00:18:01,080
I KNOW THAT THE IDOL IS IN
PROXIMITY, AND I LOST MY CLUE,

397
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:04,416
SO I CANT REALLY RECALL THE
LITTLE DETAILS.

398
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,819
IM NOT SURE EXACTLY WHERE IT
IS.

399
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,421
THE FOOD IS HONESTLY BARELY ON
MY MIND AT THIS POINT.

400
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,290
JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED.

401
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,157
UH-HUH.

402
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,992
GUYS, LETS GET A CHEERS
GOING HERE.

403
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,394
OH, YEAH, BABY.

404
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,662
LIFE IS GOOD.

405
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:20,866
CHEERS, CHEERS, CHEERS.

406
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,902
SURE, THEYRE SITTING THERE
PLOTTING OUR DEMISE.

407
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:28,474
I MEAN, I WANT TO THINK THAT
NICK HAS MY BACK ON THAT REWARD,

408
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,375
BUT THAT JABENI STRONG THING IS
SCARY.

409
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,510
THAT IS SCARY.

410
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:34,746
IM HOPING THAT ALISON WILL
BE THE ONE TO GO, BUT IM

411
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,881
VULNERABLE URGE AS WELL.

412
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:39,451
I DONT HAVE AN IDOL, BUT AT
LEAST I DO HAVE NICK IN THIS

413
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,187
GAME, WHO I CAN NOW SAY I REALLY
TRUST.

414
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:46,859
WE KNOW WEVE GOT EACH OTHERS
BACK.

415
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,061
DAMN, I CAN HEAR THEM LAUGHING
ALL THE WAY OVER HERE.

416
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:50,062
I LOVE YOU.

417
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:50,796
YOU ARE MY BROTHERS.

418
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,131
CAN WE HAVE CAKE FIRST?

419
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:53,098
UH-HUH.

420
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,200
WEVE BEEN TOGETHER SINCE
JABENI.

421
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:58,804
I WANT TO BE NEXT TO YOU TWO,
AND ITS NOT BECAUSE I THINK WE

422
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:01,240
CAN BEAT YOU, ITS BECAUSE WE
PLAYED DIFFERENT GAMES AND I

423
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:02,541
THINK WE ALL HAVE A SHOT.

424
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:06,145
WHAT WOULD GET THE THREE OF US
THERE AND WORK BACKWARD?

425
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,780
I THINK ALISON FIRST, IN MY
OPINION.

426
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:14,586
I FEEL SIMILARLY, SO THIS CAN
BE THE ALISON SMACKDOWN.

427
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:19,158
IF IT WAS UP TO ME, I FEEL
LIKE I WOULD TAKE OUT DAVIE.

428
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,960
I GENERALLY SEE DAVIE WINNING IF
HE GETS TO THE END.

429
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,663
I DONT THINK DAVIE WOULD GET
THAT MANY VOTES.

430
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,498
I JUST WANT TO GET RID OF
ALISON.

431
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:27,032
I KNOW.

432
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,333
OKAY.

433
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,469
IM FINE TO SEND ALISON HOME.

434
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:34,072
IVE BASICALLY HAD TO PUT MY
FOOT DOWN.

435
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,908
I WANTED ALISON GONE FOREVER.

436
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,376
DAVIE HAS GOT TO STAY HERE.

437
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:41,346
WERE A TIGHT TWO, AND I CANT
WITH B THE ONLY DAVID WHEN

438
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,581
THERES FIVE PEOPLE LEFT.

439
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:45,217
IF I DONT WIN THIS TOMORROW AND
IM THE ONLY DAVID, THERES A

440
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,685
GOOD CHANCE ILL BE GOING HOME.

441
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,621
WELL, I GAVE MY WORD, SO IM
STICKING WITH IT.

442
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:53,792
IT WILL BE ALISON UNLESS SHE
PLAYS AN IDOL.

443
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:54,393
ALISON COULD ALREADY HAVE IT.

444
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,028
I DONT THINK SHE DOES.

445
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,997
DO YOU?

446
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,667
OKAY, GUYS, I GOT TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING?

447
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,001
IT HAS TO STAY HERE.

448
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:03,335
PROMISE?

449
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,870
UH-HUH.

450
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,239
I FOUND A CLUE THIS MORNING.

451
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:08,407
THERE WAS A CLUE.

452
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,042
THERES A LADDER I DUG UP.

453
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,277
IT SAID THAT IT WAS IN THE ROCK
BEHIND THE WELL.

454
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:15,013
I GOT TO THE HIGHEST POINT AND I
WAS STUCK.

455
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,115
I COULD HAVE SLIPPED AND JUST
FALLEN OFF.

456
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,985
I LITERALLY COULD HAVE DIED THIS
MORNING LOOKING FOR AN IDOL.

457
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,220
I DONT KNOW.

458
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:24,990
I NEED YOUR BRAINS, AND PLEASE,
THIS IS JUST US, NO ONE ELSE.

459
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,659
OF COURSE.

460
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:28,794
NO ONE ELSE.

461
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:29,962
NOTHING.

462
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,598
GIVEN THE BIG LADDER AND
LOSING THE CLUE, I RECOGNIZE I

463
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,133
NEED A LITTLE BIT OF HELP FROM
MY FRIENDS.

464
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:35,701
ALL RIGHT.

465
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,002
I NEED THE START MOVING.

466
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,303
SORRY TO TAKE US FROM THE FOOD.

467
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:38,971
WHAT?

468
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:39,538
COME.

469
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,806
IM COMING.

470
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:41,340
IM COMING.

471
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,174
HOLD ON.

472
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:43,809
LET ME SHOW YOU WHERE THE
LADDER IS.

473
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,477
ITS LIKE A JOB.

474
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:49,214
WE BASICALLY SPRING INTO
ACTION AND DECIDE TO DIVIDE AND

475
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,282
CONQUER.

476
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:53,051
THE CLUE IS PROBABLY IN THE
SAND, BUT WERE GOING TO

477
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:53,919
START --
 ILL FIND IT.

478
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,587
WHERES THE CLUE?

479
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:58,824
I THINK ITS AT THE TREETOP.

480
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,393
REALLY USE THE MANPOWER TO FIND
MY IDOL.

481
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,061
FIND THE CLUE.

482
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,063
YOU WOULDNT NEED A LADDER TO
GET UP THERE.

483
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,632
OH, MY GOD.

484
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:13,338
THESE STORMS ARE LITERALLY --
OUCH, OUCH, OUCH.

485
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:14,273
LETS FINISH THIS UP.

486
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:18,410
LETS GET THIS JOB DONE.

487
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,711
THEYRE IDIOTS.

488
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:23,782
YOU FOUND IT?

489
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,017
ITS THERE.

490
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:25,917
ITS BEHIND THIS ROCK.

491
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,085
I BET YOU ITS BEHIND THIS ROCK.

492
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,021
CAN DO IT?

493
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,490
WILL YOU HOLD IT FOR ME.

494
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:31,890
STABILIZE.

495
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:36,561
IS THAT IT?

496
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:40,365
YES!

497
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,199
OH, MY GOD.

498
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:41,633
OH, MY GOD.

499
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:48,774
GOOD EYE.

500
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,808
OH, MY GOD.

501
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:50,876
THIS IS A TEAM EFFORT.

502
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,711
I COULDNT HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT
BOTH OF YOU.

503
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:55,580
ITS UNCOMMON FOR WOMEN TO FIND
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

504
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:58,050
SO I MADE IT ONE OF MY PERSONAL
GOALS.

505
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,552
IM BASICALLY SPEECHLESS WHEN I
FIND IT.

506
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:01,787
CONGRATULATIONS.

507
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,889
THE FACT THAT I FOUND AN IDOL
WITH MY TWO CLOSE ESTIMATES OUT

508
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:07,592
HERE BONDED THEM TO ME EVEN
MORE.

509
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:10,395
AND GUYS, LIKE WE CANT TELL
ANYONE.

510
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:13,365
WE NEED TO GET RID OF THE
LADDER, AND THEYRE STOKED.

511
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:15,867
THEYRE SO RELIEVED THAT ALISON
DOESNT HAVE IT.

512
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:21,540
THIS IDOL IS EVERYTHING.

513
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,742
HEY, GUYS.

514
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:24,976
WELCOME BACK.

515
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,211
HOW WAS IT?

516
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:30,649
I CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT IF
I DONT FLIP THE SCRIPT TODAY,

517
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:35,020
IT VERY WELL COULD BE ME GOING
HOME.

518
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:37,589
ANGELINA AND I CERTAINLY HAVE A
HISTORY TOGETHER, AND I KNOW

519
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,658
THAT SHE WANTS ME OUT.

520
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:44,196
SURVIVING TODAY IS MY GREATEST
TEST TO DATE.

521
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:45,397
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

522
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,533
IM THINKING DAVIE, BECAUSE
AS LONG AS HES IN THIS GAME,

523
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,068
NONE OF US CAN WIN.

524
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:54,473
ILL BE HONEST WITH YOU, I
COULD SWAY THIS EITHER WAY.

525
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,208
I KNOW YOU COULD.

526
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:58,043
ILL BE HONEST WITH YOU.

527
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:01,813
IVE BEEN DRIVING THE LAST
THREEISH VOTES.

528
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:02,748
I UNDERSTAND.

529
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:05,550
I DONT MEAN TO SAY THAT IN A
MOBSTER WAY.

530
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:06,752
THE POWER IS IN MY HANDS.

531
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:09,988
I WORKED VERY HARD TO BE IN THIS
POSITION RIGHT NOW, AND ITS

532
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:13,525
FINALLY TIME TO GET RID OF
ALISON.

533
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,061
WELL ITS LIKE I MAY BE GOING
HOME TODAY.

534
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,696
I KNOW THAT.

535
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,630
YEAH.

536
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:20,732
YOU KNOW, THERES NO NICETIES AT
THIS POINT.

537
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:26,571
I FEEL A LITTLE BIT LIKE A MOB
BOSS.

538
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:30,275
SHES WRONGED ME BEFORE.

539
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,077
IM EAGER TO GET SOME REVENGE ON
ALISON.

540
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,112
SHES WANTED ALISON OUT
FOREVER.

541
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,647
SHE WANTED TO DO IT LAST TIME.

542
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,182
SHES BEEN OBSESSED WITH ALISON.

543
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:38,784
NICK WANTS ALISON OUT, TOO.

544
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,118
AND I THINK ITS A MISTAKE.

545
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:45,857
I THINK WE SHOULD VOTE OUT
DAVIE, TAKE HIM OUT NEXT.

546
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:49,461
ON THE REWARD, ANGELINA AND NICK
WAS PRETTY FIRM, TODAY IS THE

547
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:50,929
DAY, WERE GETTING RID OF
ALISON.

548
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:54,933
I GAVE THEM BOTH MY WORD WE
WOULD GET RID OF ALISON, BUT I

549
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:55,901
CANT LET IT GO.

550
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,403
I DONT WANT THE KEEP DAVIE,shs
HES A BEAST.

551
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,039
LETS GET OUT DAVIE.

552
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:04,176
WHATS FUNNY IS DAVIE IS
FINISHING STRONG AND ALISON WAS

553
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:04,643
LAST IN THE CHALLENGE.

554
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:05,143
EXACTLY.

555
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:07,279
SO PICK UP DAVIE.

556
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:08,447
I AGREE.

557
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,083
MIKE HAS BEEN IN CHARGE OF ALL
THESE BLINDSIDES AND NOW HE

558
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,619
THINKS DAVIE WOULD BE A GOOD
NEXT TARGET.

559
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:15,554
BINGO, THATS WHAT I WANT.

560
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:18,056
DAVIE HAS HAD AN IMPRESSIVE GAME
SO FAR.

561
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:21,560
I CANT HAVE HIM STAY.

562
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:22,994
YOU THINK ALISON?

563
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:32,537
I HOPE THEYRE IN THE LYING
TO YOU BECAUSE WERE SO CLOSE.

564
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,639
ITS ALL ABOUT ANGELINA.

565
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,775
ANGELINA HAS A BIG EGO.

566
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:37,943
SHES GOLIATH.

567
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,479
THE MORE I MAKE IT FEEL LIKE
THIS IS HER DECISION, THE MORE

568
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,881
LIKELY IM GOING TO GET HER TO
DO WHAT I NEED HER TO DO.

569
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:47,352
I BIT MY TONGUE EARLIER, BUT
I FEEL LIKE ALISON IS LESS OF AN

570
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:51,156
ISSUE THAN DAVIE.

571
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:54,159
LIKE HIS STORY, HIS ACTION, HIS
RELATIONSHIP WITH NICK IS WAY

572
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:57,262
MORE THREATENING TO US AND, YOU
KNOW, THATS SCARY.

573
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,564
I JUST NEED ALISON OUT OF MY
WAY.

574
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:00,499
I DONT TRUST HIM.

575
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,167
I DONT TRUST EITHER OF THEM.

576
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,370
WOULD YOU AT LEAST CONSIDER
VOTING DAVIE OUT WITH ME AND

577
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:05,770
KARA?

578
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,172
OH, MY GOD.

579
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:10,976
THIS WHOLE TRIBAL COMES DOWN
TO WHETHER I HAVE DONE A

580
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,878
PERSUASIVE JOB OF CONVINCING
ANGELINA.

581
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:16,481
IM JUST SO CONFLICTED, MIKE.

582
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,749
IM SO CONFLICTED.

583
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:19,518
I KNOW DAVIES A THREAT, TOO.

584
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:23,221
IF HE REALLY CANT DO IT,
THEN OBVIOUSLY I DONT WANT IT

585
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:28,527
TO BE A --
 ITS A MUCH BETTER MOVE TO

586
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,795
KEEP ALISON IN THE GAME THAN
DAVIE.

587
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:35,100
IM IN A TREACHEROUS SITUATION
WHERE ANGELINA AND NICK BOTH

588
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:38,970
WANT ALISON OUT, AND I GAVE THEM
MY WORD I WOULD VOTE ALISON OUT.

589
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:41,973
BUT NICK AND DAVIE HAVE BEEN
BROS FROM THE BEGINNING.

590
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,542
I WANT TO BREAK THOSE TWO UP.

591
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:46,711
I WOULD RATHER HAVE DAVIE GONE
AND NICK ALL TO MYSELF.

592
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,413
I HAVE TO THREAD THE NEEDLE.

593
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:51,449
ITS NOT GOING TO BE AN EASY
CAKE WALK UNTIL THE END.

594
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:18,243
Jeff: WELL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

595
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:28,386
ELIZABETH, JOHN, DAN, ALEC,
CARL, GABBY, AND CHRISTIAN VOTED

596
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:35,894
OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

597
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,163
SO LETS START WITH TODAYS
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

598
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:40,832
ONE OF THE CLOSEST FINISHES IN A
LONG TIME.

599
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:43,802
FOR A WHILE EVERYBODY HAD A
SHOT.

600
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:45,337
ULTIMATELY NICK PULLS IT OUT.

601
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:48,907
NICK, WHATS THE FEELING ON DAY
36 TO PULL OUT THAT WIN?

602
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:53,111
YEAH, I WAS JUMPING UP AND
DOWN WHEN I FINALLY SOLVED ALL

603
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:57,282
63 PIECES OF THAT THING.

604
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:59,618
ITS THE BEST FEELING IVE HAD
OUT HERE FOR SURE.

605
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:02,988
Jeff: ANGELINA, AT THE
OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM, WHEN

606
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:05,924
YOU GOT BACK THE CAMP, DID
PEOPLE FEEL THEY WERE IN

607
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:06,691
TROUBLE?

608
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,193
A LOT OF NAMES WERE THROWN
OUT.

609
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:09,928
NAMES WERE THROWN OUT AT OUR
TABLE.

610
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,396
NAMES WERE THROWN OUT BACK AT
CAMP.

611
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:12,998
Jeff: ALISON YOU WERE
SHAKING YOUR HEAD.

612
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:17,102
I FEEL LIKE TWO NAMES MAYBE
WERE THROWN OUT, MINE AND

613
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:17,802
DAVIES.

614
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,404
Jeff: DAVIE, YOURE
NODDING.

615
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:20,739
THAT RINGS TRUE TO YOU?

616
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,807
YEAH, THATS FAIR, JEFF.

617
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:25,810
LAST TRIBAL, MYSELF AND ALISON
WERE THE ONLY ONE OTHER THAN

618
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:28,413
CHRISTIAN WHO GOT VOTES, SO YOU
KIND OF KNEW THAT IT WAS GOING

619
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:31,049
TO BE ME OR HER THAT WAS GOING
TO BE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK

620
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:31,850
TONIGHT.

621
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,618
Jeff: SO ALISON, WHAT DO
YOU DO?

622
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,721
BECAUSE EVEN HERE AT TRIBAL, YOU
AND ANGELINA HAVE GONE AT IT A

623
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:37,188
FEW TIMES.

624
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:37,489
FAIR?

625
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:38,356
FAIR.

626
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,091
Jeff: NOW THERE ARE ONLY
SIX PEOPLE.

627
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,527
IF YOURE ONE OF THE PEOPLE IN
TROUBLE, DO YOU GO TO ANGELINA

628
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,864
AND SAY, LISTEN, I KNOW WE
HAVENT ALWAYS GOTTEN ALONG, BUT

629
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:46,965
NOT ME, NOT TONIGHT.

630
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:50,735
I MEAN, ITS INTERESTING,
ANGELINA AND I FIRST WERE

631
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:54,739
ALLIES, AND EVEN AS ADVERSARIES,
THERE STILL WAS A CONNECTION AND

632
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:59,010
A BOND, SO AT SOME POINT, CAN WE
FALL BACK AT THAT?

633
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:03,748
WELL, THE LAST TWO TRIBALS MY
VOTE COULD HAVE BEEN FOR ALISON,

634
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:07,152
INSTEAD OF GOING FOR GABBY, I
COULD HAVE GONE FOR ALISON.

635
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,553
INSTEAD OF GOING FOR CHRISTIAN,
I COULD HAVE GONE FOR ALISON,

636
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:12,057
BUT WERE AT THIS POINT NOW
WHERE OUR FATES ARE TIED UP.

637
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,759
WEVE HAD A BROKEN ROAD.

638
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:17,228
YOU NEVER KNOW IN THIS GAME
WHERE YOULL END UP WITH PEOPLE.

639
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,864
Jeff: ALISON, YOU NEVER
KNOW, BUT YOU DID JUST HEAR

640
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,667
ANGELINA SAY, COULD HAVE VOTED
FOR YOU TWO TRIBALS AGO.

641
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,936
COULD HAVE VOTED FOR YOU THE
LAST TRIBAL.

642
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:26,838
NEXT SENTENCE COULD BE, MAYBE
ILL JUST DO IT TONIGHT.

643
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:31,910
AND SHE KNOWS I COULD WORK
WITH SOME PEOPLE TO GET HER OUT

644
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:32,777
TONIGHT.

645
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:33,378
SHE KNOWS THIS.

646
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:34,846
THIS IS NOT AN UNKNOWN.

647
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,681
THIS IS NOT NEW INFORMATION
TO ME.

648
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,784
Jeff: DAVIE, WHERE DO YOU
FALL IN THIS?

649
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:45,690
IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE TARGETS,
ARE YOU MAYBE THE SECOND CHOICE?

650
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:49,160
YEAH, I DO FEEL LIKE THERE IS
A PECKING ORDER, BUT IT DOESNT

651
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:50,361
MAKE ME COMFORTABLE.

652
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,264
Jeff: NICK, WHEN YOU GET
DOWN TO THIS NUMBER AND YOU HAVE

653
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:55,767
THE NECKLACE, WHAT KIND OF
OPPORTUNITY DOES THAT PRESENT

654
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,035
FOR YOU?

655
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,838
HAVING THE NECKLACE
ABSOLUTELY MAKES ME MORE

656
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:01,039
RELAXED.

657
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:04,275
IT OPENS ME UP TO PLAY THE GAME
MORE AGGRESSIVELY, BUT LONG

658
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,978
STORY SHORT, ITS A GREAT
OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO BE ON

659
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:08,346
THE SAME PAGE AS ME TONIGHT.

660
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:10,882
Jeff: WOW, MIKE, THAT WAS A
THREAT.

661
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,551
YOU SHOULD BE WITH ME TONIGHT,
BECAUSE I CAN MAKE SOMETHING

662
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,753
HAPPEN.

663
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:17,555
WELL, I THINK NICK IS A GREAT
PARTNER WHETHER HES GOT THE

664
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,757
IMMUNITY NECKLACE OR NOT.

665
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:22,327
I MEAN, 95% OF THE TIME HES
BEEN HONEST WITH ME, AND I FEEL

666
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,863
LIKE 95% OF THE TIME IVE BEEN
HONEST WITH HIM.

667
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:26,664
Jeff: THATS PRETTY GOOD ON
"SURVIVOR."

668
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,233
THATS HOW I FEEL.

669
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,100
ITS PRETTY GOOD.

670
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:30,902
SO I WANT TO BE ON THE SAME PAGE
AS NICK.

671
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:35,907
Jeff: DAVIE, CONCERN YOU AT
ALL THAT A BLINDSIDE RIGHT NOW

672
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,377
COULD REALLY LEAVE A STICK, SO I
WANT TO BE KIND TO PEOPLE EVEN

673
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,578
IF IM ABOUT TO WRITE THEIR NAME
DOWN.

674
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:45,283
I THINK THE SMALLER THE TRIBE
GETS, THE STRONGER THE BONDS

675
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:49,721
GET, AND THE MORE YOU THINK YOU
CAN TRUST SOMEONE, AND IF YOU

676
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:53,124
ARE BLINDSIDED, THAT CAN LEAVE
NASTY TASTE IN SOMEONES MOUTH,

677
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:55,460
AND THAT COULD BE YOUR MILLION
DOLLAR MISTAKE.

678
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:56,694
Jeff: WOW.

679
00:29:56,728 --> 00:30:00,331
MIKE, DAVIE JUST REALLY SUMMED
IT UP, ITS NOT THAT THE NUMBERS

680
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:05,136
GET SMALLER, ITS THAT THE BONDS
GET TIGHTER, SO A BLINDSIDE

681
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,304
HURTS A LITTLE MORE.

682
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:08,640
DOES THAT RUN THROUGH YOUR HEAD,
HOW YOU VOTE SOMEBODY OUT?

683
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:14,712
WELL RUSSIA YOU SAYING PEOPLE
ARE LYING?

684
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:18,016
YEAH, I DO UNDERSTAND THE
FEELING OF BETRAYAL AND IM SURE

685
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:22,420
I WILL FEEL THAT AT SOME POINT,
BUT YOU JUST HAVE TO TAKE A

686
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:26,191
LITTLE BIT MORE OF AN ANALYTICAL
PERSPECTIVE ON IT, AND THINK

687
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:28,426
ABOUT WHAT IS GOING TO HELP YOU
MOVE FURTHER.

688
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:32,730
ITS JUST THE NATURE OF THIS
GAME.

689
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:33,231
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

690
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:35,433
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

691
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:47,579
KARA, YOURE UP.

692
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:52,617
PURE GAME PLAY TONIGHT.

693
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:22,714
Jeff: ILL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

694
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:26,050
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

695
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:30,021
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

696
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:30,989
OKAY.

697
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:32,156
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE
DECISION IS FINAL.

698
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,692
THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL

699
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:35,827

711
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:17,235
DAVIE.

712
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,003
YOU COULD HAVE SPELLED MY
NAME RIGHT.

713
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:19,704
I DIDNT DO IT, BRO.

714
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:20,238
IM SORRY.

715
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:20,805
I DIDNT KNOW.

716
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:23,775
OF COURSE YOU DIDNT.

717
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:37,188
Jeff: DAVIE, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

718
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:40,124
NO HARD FEELINGS, GUYS, BUT I
WILL SAY THIS, THE PERSON WHO

719
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:44,028
ORCHESTRATED THIS, YOU NOW HAVE
MY VOTE FOR $1 MILLION.

720
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:46,331
ITS UP FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO MAKE
A BIGGER MOVE.

721
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:47,098
LOVE YOU GUYS.

722
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,533
LOVE YOU, DAVIE.

723
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,568
DAMN.

724
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:03,848
[HOWLING]
[LAUGHTER]

725
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:06,784
Jeff: WELL, YOUVE MADE IT
TO THE FINAL, BUT TO ECHO

726
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:11,289
DAVIES WORDS, TO GET TO THE END
AND WIN THIS GAME, STILL A LOT

727
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,157
OF GREAT GAME PLAY TO BE HAD.

728
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:14,425
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

729
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:15,293
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

730
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:20,999
GOOD NIGHT.

731
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,501
I HAD A HELL OF A TIME OUT
HERE PLAYING THIS GAME OF

732
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:24,702
"SURVIVOR."

733
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,038
I DONT KNOW WHO IT WAS THAT
ORCHESTRATED THE MOVE TO GET ME

734
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:30,408
OUT, BUT IM SATISFIED WITH MY
"SURVIVOR" GAME.

735
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,610
I WANT TO SEE A GOOD SEASON.

736
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:36,514
I WANT TO SEE SOMEBODY PLAYING
THIS GAME HARD, HARD, HARD,

737
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:42,020
BECAUSE THATS WHAT I RESPECT.

738
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:43,955
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: DAVIE ONE OF THE MOST

739
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,823
WELL-LIKED PLAYERS THIS SEASON.

740
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,092
LETS GET HIM OUT HERE.

741
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,361
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
LOOKING DAPPER.

742
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,195
WOW.

743
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:52,764
LOOK AT THAT RECEPTION.

744
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:55,400
COME ON.

745
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,434
THANK YOU.

746
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:57,835
Jeff: STANDING OVATION.

747
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:58,970
THANK YOU.

748
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,571
Jeff: LETS TALK TO DAVIE.

749
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,274
HAVE A SEAT.

750
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,943
SO FIRST OF ALL, THERE ARE TEARS
IN YOUR EYES RIGHT NOW.

751
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,211
WHAT DOES THAT FEEL LIKE?

752
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:11,282
YEAH, JEFF, JUST THE RESPONSE
THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE SEASON HAS

753
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:12,316
BEEN OVERWHELMING.

754
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,953
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I LOVE YOU GUYS.

755
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:19,090
AND I WANT TO SPEAK PARTICULARLY
TO THE BLACK AUDIENCE, I WANTED

756
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:22,460
TO GET OUT HERE AND MAKE THEM
PROUD, BECAUSE THEY DONT REALLY

757
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:26,798
WATCH "SURVIVOR" AS MUCH AS THEY
SHOULD.

758
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:27,965
I WANTED TO CHANGE THAT.

759
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:30,301
Jeff: SO LETS JUST LOOK AT
YOUR STORY.

760
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:33,137
BECAUSE I SAID AT THE TOP OF THE
SHOW, THERE ARE LOTS OF KIDS

761
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:36,307
THAT ARE WATCHING RIGHT NOW, A
LOT OF THEM IN THE AUDIENCE THAT

762
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,375
ARE DREAMING.

763
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,943
YOU WERE THAT KID WHEN YOU WERE
LIGHT EIGHT, RIGHT?

764
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,212
UH-HUH, UH-HUH, WHEN I WAS
EIGHT.

765
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,381
Jeff: WHAT WAS THE DREAM
WHEN YOU WERE IT WILLLE?

766
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,348
WHAT DID YOU IMAGINE?

767
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:46,751
SO I FOUND OUT ABOUT
"SURVIVOR" IN CHURCH.

768
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,619
I REMEMBER TURNING TO MY MOM AND
SAYING, "IM GOING TO BE ON THAT

769
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:49,854
SHOW SOME DAY."

770
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:53,391
AND IN HIGH SCHOOL, IN MIDDLE
SCHOOL I WAS A BIT OF A NERD, A

771
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,726
BIT OF A BLERD.

772
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,665
I ALWAYS TOLD MYSELF TO BE
MYSELF.

773
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:02,834
I CREATED THAT TIME.

774
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:03,367
-- TAPE.

775
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:04,368
NOW IM HERE.

776
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:05,770
SO MY STORY HAS COME FULL
CIRCLE.

777
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:09,006
Jeff: THERE IS ANOTHER PART
OF THIS STORY.

778
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,411
WE ORIGINALLY SAID TO DAVIE, AND
ILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, WE

779
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:16,347
SAID, ITS NOT GOING TO WORK OUT
THIS SEASON, MAYBE ANOTHER

780
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,482
SEASON SOME WE SAID NO.

781
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:18,249
ABSOLUTELY.

782
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,651
Jeff: WE GET TO FIJI.

783
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:23,588
WERE ABOUT 40 HOURS AWAY FROM
STARTING AND SOMETHING HAPPENED.

784
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:28,459
WE CALLED DAVIE UP AND WE SAY,
WE HAVE 40 HOURS, WE NEED YOU.

785
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:31,562
AND SO YOU ARE LITERALLY PACKING
AS WERE TALKING TO YOU, RIGHT,

786
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:32,096
ON THE PHONE?

787
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,166
YEP, YEP.

788
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,568
Jeff: SO WHAT WAS THAT
MOMENT LIKE WHEN THEY DIDNT

789
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:38,736
WANT ME AND NOW THEY LOVE ME.

790
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,972
I DIDNT EVEN TELL MY MOTHER
THAT YOU TOLD ME NOW.

791
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,840
SHES LIKE, "THEYRE GOING TO
CALL YOU.

792
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:43,841
I BET THEYRE GOING TO CALL
YOU."

793
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:47,478
IM LIKE, MOTHER, THEYRE NOT
GOING TO CALL ME.

794
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:48,579
AND THEN THEY DID.

795
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:58,556
IM JUMPING AROUND SCREAM, MY
DOG IS JUMPING WITH ME.

796
00:35:58,589 --> 00:35:59,590
I I AM HERE.

797
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:01,559
Jeff: DAVIE, ITS BEEN SUCH
A PLEASURE.

798
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:02,360
REALLY.

799
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:05,062
AND DAVIE, THREW THE GAUNTLET
DOWN.

800
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:07,231
WERE DOWN TO FIVE.

801
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:08,466
SOMEBODY BETTER STEP UP.

802
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,969
ITS THE FINALE OF "DAVID VS
GOODNIGHT."

803
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,006
GOOD JOB DUDE.

804
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:42,567
THEY BLINDSIDE ME AND STAB ME
IN THE BACK, IT MAKES ME SICK.

805
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,935
I KNOW YOU DID.

806
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:46,470
ME, MIKE, AND ANGELINA SAT THERE
AT THE SPAGHETTI DINNER AND THAT

807
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:50,908
LIED THAT WERE A FINAL THREE,
NOBODY IS GOING TO TOUCH US,

808
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:51,442
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

809
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:52,977
IM PISSED.

810
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,580
IM NOT PLAYING WITH PEOPLE THAT
DO THAT TO ME.

811
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:56,514
WHATS GOING ON?

812
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,482
I THOUGHT I HAD A CHANCE TO GO
TO THE END.

813
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,952
YOU DO.

814
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:06,023
MIKE REALLY, REALLY WANTED
DAVIE.

815
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,025
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

816
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,126
YOU DIDNT GIVE ME ONE VOTE.

817
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,660
I KNOW.

818
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,395
I DONT TRUST HIM.

819
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:12,797
REALLY THOUGHT WE HAD A FINAL
THREE.

820
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,265
I STILL BELIEVE WE DO.

821
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:15,566
I HONESTLY BELIEVE WE DO.

822
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,902
I DONT BELIEVE IT.

823
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:20,238
HELL FLIP AND VOTE ME OUT.

824
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:21,939
YOU KNOW THEYRE GOING TO COME
FOR ME NOW.

825
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,407
WHY DO YOU FEEL THAT WAY?

826
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:24,375
BECAUSE IM NEXT.

827
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,643
YOURE NOT.

828
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:28,879
ANGELINA BASICALLY SAID THAT
MIKE DUG HIS HEELS IN AND HAD TO

829
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,681
HAVE DAVIE GO.

830
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,551
AND I KNOW THATS TRUE BECAUSE
MIKE DOES THAT EVERY SINGLE

831
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:34,452
VOTE.

832
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:37,054
HES BEEN SETTING ME UP THIS
WHOLE 38 DAYS.

833
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,823
NO.

834
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,791
IF YOU GET PARANOID --
 I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.

835
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:42,193
EXHIBIT A.

836
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:45,463
IF I DONT WIN IMMUNITY, HE
MIGHT VOTE ME OUT NEXT.

837
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:48,065
WHEN MY BACK IS AGAINST THE
WALL, THATS WHEN I FIGHT AS

838
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,100
HARD AS I.

839
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:51,235
CAN HES OUT HERE TO WIN AND
HES OUT HERE THE LIE.

840
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,771
HES LIED TO ME TOO MANY TIMES.

841
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,039
IM WINNING IMMUNITY.

842
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,307
THATS WHAT IM GOING TO DO.

843
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,942
AND THEN ILL CHOOSE WHO GOES
HOME.

844
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:01,579
ITS ONE OF THOSE TWO GIRLS
NEXT.

845
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,913
IT HAS TO BE ALISON.

846
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:03,547
SHE WILL WIN.

847
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:05,783
SHE WILL WIN.

848
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:10,154
OH, MY GOD.

849
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:12,556
COME ON.

850
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,091
PUT ON YOUR BIG BOY PANTS.

851
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,260
NICK IS IN THE HAPPY THAT DAVIE
IS GONE.

852
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:20,031
ITS LIKE, NO HARD FEELINGS, BUT
I HAD TO GET RID OF YOUR PLAN

853
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,533
"B."

854
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:23,868
HES LIKE A LITTLE BOY.

855
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:24,735
HES A CHILD.

856
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:25,970
YEAH.

857
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:28,306
HES A CHILD WHO DIDNT KNOW
THAT HE SIGNED UP FOR THE GAME

858
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:29,540
OF "SURVIVOR."

859
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:33,377
NOTHING WILL CHANGE AS FAR AS
HOW THIS GAME IS GOING TO END.

860
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:35,680
I KNOW YOURE IN A WORSE
POSITION, BUT YOURE NOT NEXT ON

861
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:36,514
THE CHOPPING BLOCK.

862
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:38,182
THE PLAN IS TO GET ALISON OUT.

863
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:39,283
YOU PROMISED.

864
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:44,221
I SWEAR TO --
 NICK IS NOT HAPPY. HIS BUDDY

865
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:48,259
IT MAKES ME WORRIED NICK MIGHT
TRY TO BLOW UP MY SPOT.

866
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:52,496
SO I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD GET HIM
OUT OF HERE NOW BEFORE HE CAN

867
00:38:52,530 --> 00:39:03,641
COME AFTER ME.

868
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:07,511

00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:32,703

00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:41,779
ONCE YOU HAVE THE KEY, YOULL

881
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:46,951

PUZZLE PIECES AND USE THOSE

882
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:51,722

THIS IS SIGNIFICANT, BECAUSE AT

THREE OR AT THE VERY LEAST HAVE

00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,212
TAKE A SPOT.

892
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,046
WELL GET STARTED.

893

00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:30,327
OH, MY GOD.

895
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:31,061

FOR IMMUNITY -- HOLD ON, ALISON.

898
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:39,570
I CANT BALANCE.

899
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:47,745

YOUR FEET.

00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:51,515

902
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:57,888
ALISON ALREADY NERVOUS QUICKLY
GOES TO HER KNEES.

903
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:01,425
YOURE GOING TO GET THAT BUCKET,
DROP IT, PULL IT UP, AND GET

904
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,526
WATER.

905
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,996
THE TRICK IS THAT WATER IS GOING
TO START LEAKING OUT.

906
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:10,267
THE FASTER YOU GET IT UP AND
START POURING, THE BETTER.

907
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,702
ANGELINA UP FIRST WITH HER
BUCKET.

908
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:14,972
NOT MUCH IN THERE AND NOT MUCH
GOES IN THE CHUTE.

909
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:17,441
YOU WANT TO POUR THAT WATER IN
THE CHUTE.

910
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:21,846
THE MORE WATER IN THE CHUTE, THE
FASTER YOUR KEY WILL RISE.

911
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:24,482
NICKS KEY IS STARTING TO RISE.

912
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:29,487

916
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:48,472

917
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,707
ALISONS ON THE MOVE.

918
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,443
CAN SHE REACH IT?

919
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:53,077

ALISON WITH ANOTHER FAST
RETRIEVAL OF WATER.

923
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,455
CAN SHE GET IT IN THAT CHUTE?

924
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:06,857
YES, ALISONS KEY IS VERY CLOSE.

925
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:09,994
ALISON IS THE FIRST TO GET HER
KEY, AND SHE WAS THE MOST

926
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,663
NERVOUS TO START THIS CHALLENGE.

927
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,765

930
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:22,673
WILL THIS BE ENOUGH?

931
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,542
NICK JUST OUT OF REACH.

932
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:28,946
IT IS ALISON BACK NOW UNLOCKING
HER PUZZLE PIECES.

933
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:31,115
WITH THE EARLY LEAD IN THIS
CHALLENGE.

934
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:33,217
NICK GOING TO GIVE IT ANOTHER
GO.

935
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:39,657
WILL IT BE ENOUGH?

936
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:40,190
YES.

937
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,458
NICK REACHES HIS KEY.

938
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:43,494
HES IN THE WATER.

939
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:44,828
ALISON UNLOCKS HER PIECES.

940
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:47,064
SHE CAN START ON THE PUZZLE.

941
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:49,300

NICK UNLOCKS HIS PUZZLE PIECES.

947
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:12,690
IT IS NOW ANGELINA WHO STILL
CANNOT REACH HER KEY.

948
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:15,326
SHE HAS TO RETRIEVE ANOTHER
BUCKET OF WATER.

949
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,462
ALISON AND NICK WORKING TO GET
THEIR PIECES FREE.

950
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:20,264
MIKE AND KARA NOW BACK.

951
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:23,667
THEY CAN UNLOCK THEIR PIECES.

952
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:26,170
ANGELINA, WILL THIS DO IT RIGHT
HERE?

953
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:29,506
ANGELINA HAS HER KEY.

954
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:33,544
SHES IN THE WATER.

00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:37,715
IT IS ALISON AND NICK WITH THEIR
PIECES FREE.

956
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:44,922
YOURE BUILDING A FACE, TWO EYE,
A NOSE, AND A NICE TONGUE.

957
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:48,092
ANGELINA SWIMMING BACK VERY
SLOWLY, FIGHTING THAT TIDE.

958
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,927
THAT WATER IS TOUGH.

959
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,796
NICK WITH ANOTHER PIECE.

960
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:55,432
ALISON LOOKS FOR ANOTHER SPOT.

961
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,635
MIKE WITH A PIECE.

962
00:43:57,668 --> 00:44:01,071
KARA PLACING PIECES.

ANGELINA BACK.

964
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:06,343
SHES GOING TO GET IN THIS NOW.

965
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:11,115
NICK VERY METHODICAL, NOT
PANICKING AT ALL, EACH PIECE

966
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:11,815
EXAMINING.

967
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:16,020
MIKE STILL WITH ONLY ONE PIECE.

968
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:18,722
ALISON TAKING SOME PIECES OFF
NOW.

969
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:22,059
WORKING A LITTLE BACKWARD,
TRYING THE FIND THE RIGHT ONE.

NICK WITH ANOTHER PIECE.

976
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:42,513
TURNING INTO A BLOWOUT RIGHT
NOW.

977
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:46,817
NICK THINKS HE HAS IT.

978
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:51,021
AND HE DOES!

979
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:53,557
NICK WINS HIS SECOND INDIVIDUAL

980
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:54,591

AND A GUARANTEED SHOT AT THE
FINAL THREE.

982
00:44:58,629 --> 00:44:59,963
THAT WAS HARD, NICK.

983
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:03,367
THAT WAS.

984
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,702
Jeff: NICK, COME ON OVER.

985
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:08,772

Jeff: SECOND INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY WIN IN A ROW.

987
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,776

GUARANTEED A SPOT IN THE FINAL
FOUR, AND AT THE VERY LEAST A

989
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:18,515
SHOT TO MAKE FIRE TO GET INTO
THREE.

990
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,951
THIS WAS A HUGE WIN.

991
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:25,589
SADLY, FOR THE REST OF YOU,
AFTER 37 DAYS IN THIS GAME,

992
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:29,660
ANGELINA, ALISON, MIKE, KARA,
SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT

993
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:30,794
TONIGHT, THE DREAM WILL END.

994
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:34,131
SHOULD BE A VERY INTERESTING
AFTERNOON IN WHAT HAS BEEN A

995
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:35,766
VERY FLUID GAME.

996
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:38,969
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

997
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:41,138
APPRECIATE IT.

998
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:41,872
I WON.

999
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,607
I GOT THE NECKLACE AGAIN.

1000
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,342
IT IS FANTASTIC.

1001
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:47,111
I WAS BLINDD SIDED AT THE LAST
TRIBAL.

1002
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:48,545
NOW I HAVE ALL THE POWER AGAIN.

1003
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,582
THATS GOING TO MAKE REVENGE
TASTE PRETTY SWEET.

1004
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,195
GOOD JOB, NICK.

1005
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:07,297
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1006
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:08,232
TWO IN A ROW.

1007
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,800
YEAH, BABY.

1008
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:10,200
LOVE IT.

1009
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:11,335
AWESOME.

1010
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:12,536
REALLY AWESOME.

1011
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:17,307
SO NICK PULLS OUT ANOTHER
IMMUNITY WIN, BEATS ALISON, AND

1012
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:29,486
I AM ELATED, BECAUSE I AM DEAD
SET ON GETTING HER OUT NEXT.

1013
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,854
TONIGHT SHOULD BE EASY.

1014
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:34,558
I HAVE AN IDOL IN MY POCKET, BUT
THE LAST TIME YOU CAN PLAY AN

1015
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:40,297
IDOL IS AT FIVE, SO TONIGHT MY
PLAN IS TO CREATE AN EPIC TRIBAL

1016
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:43,367
COUNCIL, MAKE AS MANY FIREWORKS
AS POSSIBLE AND HAVE ME BE THE

1017
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,701
STAR OF THE SHOW.

1018
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,538
SO I HAVE A VISION FOR
TONIGHT.

1019
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:51,942
ALISON HAS TO GO, RIGHT.

1020
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:56,079
SO YOU GET THOSE TWO TO VOTE FOR
ME.

1021
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:59,983
I PLAY THE IDOL FOR MYSELF AND
WE FINALLY GET ALISON OUT.

1022
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:04,955
MY DREAM SCENARIO IS PLAYING A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL CORRECTLY

1023
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,623
AT A PIVOTAL POINT IN THE GAME.

1024
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:10,661
I THINK IT MAKES ME LOOK MORE
LICK A BAD ASS TO THE JURY.

1025
00:47:10,694 --> 00:47:14,531
LETS BE HONEST, I HAVE NO
OUTPLAY CATEGORY.

1026
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:16,433
THIS GIVES ME ONE THING.

1027
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:18,302
IM PROBABLY NOT GOING TO GET
IMMUNITY.

1028
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,436
ITS JUST FOR THE JURY.

1029
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:21,338
ITS JUST FOR THE JURY.

1030
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:24,675
THAT FEELS LIKE A LITTLE
EXTRA LIE.

1031
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:26,210
I FEEL A LITTLE WEIRD ABOUT IT.

1032
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:29,813
ITS A LITTLE CATTY, BUT IT
IS A LITTLE PERSONAL WITH

1033
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:30,881
ALISON.

1034
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:33,350
ANGELINAS "SURVIVOR"
STRATEGY, I DONT KNOW, ITS

1035
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:34,251
FROM OUTER SPACE.

1036
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:38,622
WE DONT NEED THE NEAT RICKS --
THEATRICS.

1037
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:39,623
ITS DAY 37.

1038
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:43,327
I DONT NEED TO HAVE SOME
SHOWCASE FOR ANGELINA.

1039
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:48,098
LIKE PART OF ME WANTS TO DO A
FAKE IDOL AND MAKE HER FEEL

1040
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:50,234
LIKE --
 I THINK IT WOULD MAKE A MORE

1041
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:52,002
EXCITING TRIBAL COUNCIL, THATS
FOR SURE.

1042
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,737
IM GOING TO FAKE IDOL HER.

1043
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:56,707
THIS SHOULD NOT BE A
COMPLICATED VOTE, BUT ANGELINA

1044
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:01,144
WANTS ME TO DO THE JOB OF LYING
TO KARA AND ALISON.

1045
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:04,147
I DONT MIND LYING A LITTLE BIT
TO ALISON BECAUSE SHES GOING

1046
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:08,185
HOME, BUT I HAVE A GOOD
RELATIONSHIP WITH KARA, I DONT

1047
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:13,390
WANT TO JEOPARDIZE THAT BECAUSE
ANGELINA HAS AN IDEA FOR A BIG

1048
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:22,232
FIREWORKS DISPLAY AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL TONIGHT.

1049
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:27,537
ANGELINA HAS AN IDOL.

1050
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:32,075
SHE HAS THIS PLAN SHE WANTS TO
USE THE IDOL IN SOME DRAMATIC

1051
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:33,310
WAY.

1052
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:36,446
SO SHE WANTS ME TO CONVINCE YOU
AND ALISON TO VOTE HER OUT, SO

1053
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,547
SHE CAN PLAY THE IDOL.

1054
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,249
OH, MY GOSH.

1055
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:41,652
THAT IS HILARIOUS.

1056
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:45,622
ITS GREAT THAT MIKE IS TELLING
ME ABOUT ANGELINAS, YOU KNOW,

1057
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:46,790
IMMUNITY IDOL.

1058
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:48,825
I THINK THE MORE PEOPLE THAT
KNOW ABOUT IT, THE WORSE IT IS

1059
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:49,860
FOR HER.

1060
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:58,402
THAT IS EVIL.

1061
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:01,171
SHES EVIL.

1062
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:04,775
I MEAN, ALISON SHOULD GOSH, BUT
THATS CRAZY.

1063
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:05,943
SHES SO EXCITED.

1064
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:08,845
THIS IS WHY SHE WANTED TO PLAY
THE GAME, TO BE A DIABOLICAL

1065
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:09,446
VILLAIN.

1066
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:11,214
I DONT KNOW.

1067
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:12,449
VILLAINS VERSUS VILLAINS.

1068
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:15,052
ANGELINA.

1069
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:16,253
A MAD CASTAWAY.

1070
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:19,990
MIKE WANTS ALISON TO GO, AND
YES, ALISON WOULD BE AN EASY

1071
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:22,960
VOTE, BUT MIKE HAS A REALLY
STRONG SOCIAL GAME.

1072
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:27,030
HES CLEARLY THE BIGGEST THREAT
TO WIN AGAINST ANY OF US IN THE

1073
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:28,265
FINAL THREE.

1074
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:33,537
MAYBE VOTING HIM OUT WOULD BE A
MILLION DOLLARS IN MY POCKET.

1075
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:38,542
OH, MY GOD.

1076
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:40,077
I HAVE THE TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

1077
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:44,481
MIKE TOLD ME THAT ANGELINA HAS
THE IDOL.

1078
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:45,349
DONT FREAK OUT.

1079
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:46,316
DONT FREAK OUT.

1080
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:50,020
WERE GOING TO GET CREATIVE.

1081
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:51,855
WERE GOING TO FLIP SCRIPT
SOMEHOW.

1082
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:54,358
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT GETTING
MIKE OUT?

1083
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:58,929
THAT WOULD BE AMAZING.

1084
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:01,965
SOMEHOW WE NEED TO GET NICK
INVOLVED.

1085
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:07,204
IT IS MUSIC TO MY EARS THAT
KARAS READY TO VOTE OUT MIKE.

1086
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:11,641
MIKE IS SOMEONE THAT I GENUINELY
DEEPLY CARE ABOUT, BUT MIKE IS

1087
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,076
THE ONLY OPTION AT THIS POINT.

1088
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:18,515
I HAVE TO PUT MIKES NAME OUT
THERE.

1089
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:22,853
YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY BUILDING A
CASE FOR YOURSELF.

1090
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:26,189
IM IN THE POSITION WHERE IF
THERE IS ANY MOVE THAT ISNT ME,

1091
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:27,224
IM ALL EARS.

1092
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:31,995
WELL, THEY STRAIGHT UP
BETRAYED ME LAST NIGHT.

1093
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,964
SO IM DEFINITELY OPEN TO
OPTIONS.

1094
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:36,500
I HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING
MYSELF TO THE FINAL THREE MORE

1095
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,601
THAN ANYTHING.

1096
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:39,970
WHEN I LOOK AT MIKE, HE HAS
GREAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH

1097
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:41,004
EVERYONE.

1098
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,273
THERES NOBODY OUT HERE THAT
DOESNT LIKE MIKE.

1099
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:44,241
RIGHT.

1100
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:46,810
Jeff: MIKE IS PLAYING A
GOOD STRATEGIC GAME.

1101
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:48,945
AND IT GETS MY GEARS TURNING.

1102
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:51,948
IM THINKING, WELL, IF IM
SITTING NEXT TO MIKE, WHERE ARE

1103
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:52,816
THE VOTES GOING?

1104
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:54,718
MIKE IS A THREAT TO WIN THIS
GAME.

1105
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:57,988
AND HE COULD EVEN BEAT ME, AND I
THINK IVE PLAYED A VERY GOOD

1106
00:50:58,021 --> 00:50:59,222
GAME.

1107
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:02,626
ITS REALLY GOT ME RACKING MY
BRAIN HERE ON WHAT I SHOULD DO.

1108
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:03,760
HAVE YOU TALKED TO KARA?

1109
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:05,228
I TALKED TO CARA.

1110
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:06,296
SHE SAID SHE WOULD BE DOWN.

1111
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:07,497
Jeff: REALLY?

1112
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:09,399
SHE IS PREPARED.

1113
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:12,903
I REALLY THINK LIKE ANGELINAS
NOT THE THREAT HERE.

1114
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:13,270
MIKE IS.

1115
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:14,337
I AGREE.

1116
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:16,840
Jeff: ANGELINA AND MIKE ARE
VOTING ALISON.

1117
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:20,077
AND ALISON IS GOING TO VOTE MIKE
BECAUSE SHELL DO WHATEVER SHES

1118
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:25,649
GOT TO DO TO STAY SOME THE VOTE
TONIGHT COMES DOWN TO WHAT ME

1119
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:27,350
AND KARA DECIDE IS BEST FOR OUR
GAME.

1120
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:29,419
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1121
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:31,488
WE HAVE TO VOTE TOGETHER.

1122
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:33,457
I WANT TO DO WHATS BEST FOR ME
AND YOU.

1123
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:36,359
I DONT WANT HIM IN THE FINAL
THREE.

1124
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:37,627
HE HAS PLAYED A GOOD GAME.

1125
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:41,598
HE HAS, BUT IS IT BETTER THAN
ALISON?

1126
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:43,033
WOULD HE GET MORE VOTES FOR HER?

1127
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:44,701
THATS THE QUESTION.

1128
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:48,338
I GOT BLINDSIDED LAST NIGHT.

1129
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:51,074
IT WAS MIKE.

1130
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,610
SO NOW I GOT MIKES LIFE RIGHT
HERE, AND IF I WANT TO PULL THE

1131
00:51:53,643 --> 00:52:01,017
TRIGGER, I CAN JUST LET HIM GO.

1132
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:03,286
SHUT UP.

1133
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,654
MIKE, YOU FOUND IT.

1134
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:07,357
ALISON IS GOING HOME TONIGHT,
AND IM FEELING A LITTLE

1135
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:11,795
NAUGHTY.

1136
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:12,429
SO MAYBE BORDERLINE EVIL.

1137
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,598
MAYBE BORDERLINE MEAN GIRL.

1138
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:17,400
I DIDNT THINK I WOULD EVER
FIND ONE.

1139
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:19,169
WHAT DOES IT SAY?

1140
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:23,473
THIS FAKE IDOL IS ALMOST THE
PERFECT CHERRY ON TOP OF AN

1141
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:25,442
ALREADY PERFECT NIGHT FOR ME.

1142
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:30,413
SO GET READY FOR AN EPIC TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

1143
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:34,417
Jeff: WELL, ITS A BIG
MOVE.

1144
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:36,486
THE QUESTION IS, IS IT A GOOD
MOVE?

1145
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:40,423
I WANT TO ASK AN EXPERT,
SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS THIS GAME

1146
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:43,226
VERY WELL, ZEKE FROM MILLENNIALS
AND GAME CHANGERS.

1147
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,628
ZEKE, YOURE VERY SAVVY.

1148
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:47,597
ANGELINA IS PLOTTING A DELICATE
MOVE.

1149
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:48,465
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT?

1150
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,834
YOU GOT TO WONDER IF ITS NOT
TOO BIG.

1151
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:53,436
YOU WANT FIREWORKS, YOU WANT THE
JURY TO SEE YOURE PLAYING HARD,

1152
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,773
BUT IF YOU PLAY TOO HARD, YOULL
GET VOTED OUT BEFORE YOU GET TO

1153
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:57,641
THE END.

1154
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,442
Jeff: THIS IS WHY YOURE SO
GOOD.

1155
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:00,477
YES.

1156
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,914
I GOT TO SAY HELLO TO YOUR
BOYFRIEND, NIKKO SANTOS.

1157
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:05,248
YOUR CAREER IS ON FIRE.

1158
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:08,985
EXCUSE ME FOR STEPPING IN FRONT
OF YOU, NOT ONLY YOUR TV SHOW,

1159
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:12,355
"CRAZY RICH ASIAN," YOUR CAREER
AND LIFE HAS TO BE A FUN TIME.

1160
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:15,058
ITS AMAZING.

1161
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:18,361
BUT THE CHERRY ON TOP OF THE
SUNDAE IS THIS GUY RIGHT HERE.

1162
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:21,198
Jeff: WHO, I MIGHT ADD,
THEY MET WHEN ZEKE WAS KIND

1163
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:25,001
ENOUGH TO REPRESENT US AT THE
GLADD AWARDS.

1164
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:28,405
WE MET AT THE AFTER-PARTY OF
THE GLADD AWARDS.

1165
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:33,310
HE WON AND WE WERE LIKE, LETS
GO CELEBRATE.

1166
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:35,212
Jeff: "SURVIVOR" MAKING
LOVE HAPPEN.

1167
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:36,313
I LIKE IT.

1168
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,448
WERE LIVE IN LOS ANGELES.

1169
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:44,287
THE FINALE OF DAVID VERSUS
GOLIATH.

1170
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:18,622
Jeff: WELL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1171
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:19,556
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1172
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,392
SO LETS START WITH THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1173
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:26,129
NICK, IT APPEARED YOU TOO WERE
BLINDSIDED BY THE DAVIE VOTE.

1174
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:27,998
YES, I WAS BLINDSIDED.

1175
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:30,033
I DIDNT KNOW EVERYBODY WAS
VOTING DAVIE.

1176
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:31,835
I THAWING EVERYBODY WAS VOTING
ALISON.

1177
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:34,037
Jeff: WHEN YOU GOT BACK THE
CAMP, WAS THERE A DISCUSSION?

1178
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,506
YEAH, I WANTED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

1179
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:40,543
I HAD A BIT OF A TEMPER AND I
WAS HOTHEADED.

1180
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:44,347
IM NOT SURE WHICH STUNG MORE,
LOSING DAVIE OR BEING LEFT OUT

1181
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:45,448
OF THE LOOP.

1182
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:47,884
Jeff: ANGELINA, WERE YOU
PART OF THAT CONVERSATION?

1183
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:50,053
I SAID, WEVE ALL BEEN THERE.

1184
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:53,156
THIS GAME HAS A WAY OF PULLING
OUT EMOTIONS, SO I TALKED WITH

1185
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:57,260
HIM AND EXPLAINED MY DECISION
AND I THINK WE LEFT ON A GOOD

1186
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,595
FOOT AFTER THE CONVERSATION.

1187
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:02,599
Jeff: ALISON, THE OTHER
THING THAT HAPPENED IS DAVIE

1188
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,335
TURNED AROUND AND SAID, WHOEVER
MADE THAT MOVE, YOU HAVE MY

1189
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:08,938
VOTE, UNLESS SOMEBODY ELSE TOPS
IT, DID YOU FEEL A NEED TO MAKE

1190
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,173
MOVES THESE LAST FEW DAYS?

1191
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:11,241
CERTAINLY.

1192
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:19,249
I THINK WERE ALL PEDAL TO THE
METTLE AT THIS POINT.

1193
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:22,118
Jeff: JEFF, THE GUY THAT
WANTS TO BE BLIND SIDED I HAD NO

1194
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,286
PART IN.

1195
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,955
THERES OTHER PEOPLE I HAVE
BLINDSIDED WHO PROBABLY DIDNT

1196
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,058
APPRECIATE IT SO MUCH SOME A
COMMENT LIKE THAT WHEN SOMEONE

1197
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:31,695
IS WALKING OUT THE DOOR CAN MAKE
YOU REASSESS WHAT DECISIONS AM I

1198
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:33,663
GOING TO MAKE IN THE NEXT TWO
DAYS.

1199
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:35,665
Jeff: ANGELINA, WHATS
REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT TONIGHT

1200
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:38,968
IS THAT WHICHEVER FOUR OF YOU
SURVIVE, YOURE GUARANTEED SOME

1201
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,370
SHOT AT THE FINAL THREE.

1202
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:42,372
SO THIS IS A VERY BIG VOTE.

1203
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:46,843
YEAH, I MEAN, IT WAS ALL OUT
BATTLE BACK AT CAMP TODAY.

1204
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:49,946
MOSTLY BETWEEN ME AND ALISON.

1205
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:52,916
Jeff: STILL.

1206
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:57,220
YES, YOU KNOW, IT BOILS DOWN
TO ME AND ALISON AND WHO CAN WE

1207
00:55:57,253 --> 00:56:00,657
GET TO FIGHT ALONGSIDE US, AND
ITS KIND OF THE CULMINATION OF

1208
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,192
BOTH OF OUR SOCIAL GAMES.

1209
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:04,561
IM CURIOUS TO SEE HOW IT TURNS
OUT.

1210
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:07,764
IM FEELING CONFIDENT, BUT YOU
NEVER KNOW UNTIL YOU KNOW.

1211
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:10,467
Jeff: NICK, ANGELINA SAYS,
WHO CAN I RALLY.

1212
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,803
YOU WOULD BE A LIKELY PERSON TO
RALLY BECAUSE YOURE SAFE.

1213
00:56:13,837 --> 00:56:15,171
ABSOLUTELY.

1214
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,841
AND ANGELINA AND MIKE HAVE BEEN
CLOSE, AND KARA AND ALISON HAVE

1215
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:20,944
BEEN CLOSE, SO JUST ABOUT ANY
WAY YOU SLICE IT, I GOT AN

1216
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:22,112
IMPORTANT VOTE NO MATTER WHAT.

1217
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:25,515
Jeff: SO ALISON, IT CAN
ONLY BE ONE OF THE FOUR OF YOU.

1218
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:26,449
WERE YOU WORRIED?

1219
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:27,384
DID YOU HEAR YOUR NAME?

1220
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:28,084
OF COURSE.

1221
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:29,853
I HAVE BEEN TARGET FOR SO LONG.

1222
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,221
NOW THERE IS NOWHERE TO HIDE.

1223
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:35,892
THE PEOPLE IN FRONT OF ME ARE
PLAYING REALLY CLEVER GAME, AS

1224
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:36,659
WELL.

1225
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:37,560
Jeff: WHO ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?

1226
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:39,262
I THINK MIKE IS A THREAT TO
SOME DEGREE.

1227
00:56:39,295 --> 00:56:41,364
HOWS THAT?

1228
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,166
THATS INCORRECT.

1229
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:44,401
ANYWAY, WHATEVER.

1230
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:47,670
I MEAN, TO ME ITS LIKE I THINK
THERES SOMETHING GREAT ABOUT

1231
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:51,207
LEAVING IT ALL OUT ON THE
ISLAND, AND THEN THERES ALSO

1232
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:55,445
LEAVING WITH A SHRED OF DIGNITY.

1233
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:58,181
THATS MY OPINION ON THIS.

1234
00:56:58,214 --> 00:57:00,083
Jeff: ALISON, THATS RIGHT
BACK TOWARD YOU.

1235
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:06,022
YEAH, SO HES SITTING THERE
SAYING FOR ME TRYING TO PLAY AN

1236
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:09,926
ALL-OUT GAME IS ME LOSING PRIDE,
AND HIS RELATIONSHIP IS ARGUABLY

1237
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:12,095
ONE OF THE ONES IVE VALUED NOSE
OUT HIRE.

1238
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:13,263
YEAH, WHATEVER.

1239
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:15,965
Jeff: SO THIS IS ANOTHER
RELATIONSHIP, ALISON, THAT HAS

1240
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:16,266
FRICTION.

1241
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:17,434
YEAH.

1242
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:19,068
Jeff: AND YOUR HOPE THEN
TONIGHT IS THAT YOU CAN RALLY

1243
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:19,869
NICK AND KARA?

1244
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:21,971
OF COURSE.

1245
00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:25,275
Jeff: KARA, THERE IS OFTEN
A POINT IN THIS GAME WHERE WHAT

1246
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:27,777
WAS A LIABILITY BECOMES AN
OPPORTUNITY.

1247
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:29,913
MAYBE I KEEP SOMEBODY WHO HAS
BEEN ARGUING.

1248
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,147
MAYBE THATS BETTER FOR ME.

1249
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:34,517
YEAH, WE TALKED SO MUCH ABOUT
THE END OF THE GAME AND WERE

1250
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:35,952
HERE, WERE ON DAY 37.

1251
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:38,087
WE CAN LOOK TO DAY 39.

1252
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:40,924
YOU WANT THE LOOK WHO YOU MIGHT
BE SITTING AT THE FINAL THREE

1253
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,159
WITH AND FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE A
FIGHTING CHANCE TO GET THOSE

1254
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:44,861
VOTES OVER THE OTHER TWO YOURE
SITTING WITH.

1255
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:45,929
Jeff: NICK, YOURE NODDING.

1256
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,163
EXACTLY.

1257
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:51,000
THE DECISION TONIGHT IS NOT WHO
DO I GET RID OF, ITS WHO DO I

1258
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:51,701
KEEP IN THE GAME.

1259
00:57:51,734 --> 00:57:53,670
LIKE WHO DO I THINK I CAN BEAT?

1260
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:54,904
WHO WILL TAKE ME TO THE END.

1261
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:56,973
WHO CAN I BEAT IN FIRE?

1262
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:59,309
SO ITS ABOUT THE OTHER THREE
PEOPLE THATS GOING TO BE WITH

1263
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:03,379
ME HERE TOMORROW.

1264
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:03,947
Jeff: OKAY.

1265
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,082
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1266
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:16,125
ALISON, YOURE UP.

1267
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:22,398
ALISON, YOURE UP.

1268
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:30,039
ALISON, IN REAL LIFE YOU MAY
GET STRAIGHT As, BUT IN

1269
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:38,581
"SURVIVOR" YOU GET A B PLUS.

1270
00:58:38,615 --> 00:58:41,618
ONLY BECAUSE I CANT SIT WITH
YOU IN THE FINAL THREE, BECAUSE

1271
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:44,988
I DONT WANT TO GIVE ANGELINA
THE SATISFACTION OF PLAYING AN

1272
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:51,694
IDOL CORRECTLY.

1273
00:58:52,228 --> 00:59:01,638
Jeff: ILL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

1274
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:03,940
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

1275
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:13,082
TONIGHT IS THE LAST TIME YOU CAN
DO SO.

1276
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:14,250
ILL PLAY THIS THING.

1277
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:18,588
I HAVE A NOTE AND I HAVE A SHELL
WITH SOME ROPE AROUND IT.

1278
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:22,759
I FEEL ALMOST 100% CERTAIN ITS
FALSE, BUT ILL HAVE YOU CHECK

1279
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:31,467
IT OUT, BECAUSE WHATS THE HARM?

1280
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:34,938
Jeff: ALISON, YES, THIS
IDOL IS A FAKE.

1281
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:38,374
ANY VOTES CAST FOR YOU WILL
STILL COUNT.

1282
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:39,242
ILL READ THE VOTES.

1283
00:59:39,275 --> 00:59:40,843
OH, IM SORRY.

1284
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:43,079
WERE NOT DONE YET.

1285
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:48,651
SO I MAY HAVE MADE THE WORST
FAKE IDOL IN IDOL HISTORY, BUT

1286
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:55,191
LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO FIND THIS
LITTLE GUY.

1287
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:59,729
THATS GNARLY.

1288
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,731
IM CONFIDENT I HAVE THE
VOTES TONIGHT TO GO TOWARD

1289
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:05,201
ALISON, BUT ID LOVE A
GUARANTEED SPOT IN THE FINAL

1290
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:05,969
FOUR, JEFF.

1291
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:13,009
YOU MADE ME WORK FOR THAT ONE,
TOO.

1292
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:15,712
Jeff: THIS IS A REAL HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

1293
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:18,748
ANY VOTES CAST FOR ANGELINA WILL
NOT COUNT.

1294
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:22,952
ILL READ THE VOTES.

1295
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:27,991
FIRST VOTE, MIKE.

1296
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:28,891
ALISON.

1297

WERE TIED, ONE VOTE MIKE, ONE
VOTE ALISON.

1298
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:35,465
ALISON.

1299
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:41,938
TWO VOTES ALISON, ONE VOTE MIKE.

1300
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:44,707
16th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE NINTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

1301
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:46,142
ALISON, THATS THREE, THATS
ENOUGH.

1302
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:50,680
YOU NEED ME TO BRING ME YOUR
TORCH.

1303
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:55,118
THANKS FOR LETTING ME BE PART
OF YOUR DISFUN SHUNNAL FAMILY.

1304
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:56,486
LOVE YOU, ALISON.

1305
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:57,854
GREAT GAME.

1306
01:00:57,887 --> 01:00:59,155
THANK YOU.

1307
01:00:59,188 --> 01:01:00,390
REALLY A BLAST.

1308
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:03,292
OH, JEFF, I WAS HOPING WE COULD
AVOID THIS.

1309
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:09,365
Jeff: ALISON, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

1310
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:10,600
GOOD LUCK.

1311
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:17,273
ILL SEE YOU GUYS SOON.

1312
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:20,309
Jeff: WELL, YOUVE MADE IT
TO THE FINAL FOUR.

1313
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:23,579
TOMORROW YOULL COMPETE IN YOUR
FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

1314
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:25,048
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

1315
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:26,082
THANKS, JEFF.

1316
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:29,485
Jeff: GOOD NIGHT.

1317
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:34,257
I CANT SAY IM TOTALLY
SURPRISED BY THAT.

1318
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:36,225
IT ACTUALLY SUCKS A LOT TO BE ON
THE JURY.

1319
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:38,761
I WAS ON THE EDGE OF LEAVING FOR
FIVE TRIBAL COUNCILS.

1320
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:42,365
YOU CAN ONLY CHASE AWAY THE GRIM
REAPER FOR SO LONG.

1321
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:49,272
THE GRIM REAPER, I ALWAYS MEAN
JEFF WITH HIS TORCH SNUFFER.

1322
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:09,058
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

1323
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:17,100
HERE WE ARE FOR THE FINAL
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

1324
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:20,002
FIRST THINGS FIRST, NICK, GOT
TAKE BACK THE NECKLACE.

1325
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:20,703
ALL RIGHT.

1326
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:28,211
SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

1327
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:30,146
BOY, ANGELINA ALREADY STUDYING
IT.

1328
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:32,248
YOU DONT EVEN NEED AN
EXPLANATION.

1329
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:33,049
YOUVE SEEN THIS CHALLENGE.

1330
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:34,183
YES.

1331
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:37,253
Jeff: SHALL I TELL YOU
ANYWAY JUST FOR A REMINDER IS

1332
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:37,653
THIS.

1333
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:38,154
DEFINITELY.

1334
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:40,089
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1335
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:45,995
FOR THE LAST TIME IMMUNITY IS
BACK UP FOR GRABS.

1336
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:48,431
FOR TODAYS CHALLENGE, YOURE
GOING TO HAVE ONE HAND TIED

1337
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:49,332
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

1338
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:51,834
ON MY GO, YOULL DROP A BALL
DOWN A CHUTE.

1339
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:56,639
IT WILL SPIRAL TO THE BOTTOM
WHERE YOU MUST CATCH IT, DROP IT

1340
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:57,807
BACK IN.

1341
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,777
AT REGULAR INTERVALS WELL ADD
ANOTHER BALL, MAKING IT MORE

1342
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:01,844
DIFFICULT.

1343
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:06,582
IF IT AT ANY POINT A BALL DROPS,
YOURE OUT.

1344
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:11,120
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS
IMMUNITY, IS GUARANTEED A SPOT

1345
01:03:11,154 --> 01:03:14,857
AT THE FINAL THREE WHERE YOU
WILL GET A CHANCE TO PLEAD YOUR

1346
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:19,162
CASE TO THE JURY ABOUT WHY YOU
DESERVE THE TITLE OF SOLE

1347
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:21,197
SURVIVOR AND THE $1 MILLION
PRIZE.

1348
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:25,368
YOU ALSO HAVE POWER, BECAUSE YOU
WILL DECIDE WHO YOU BRING WITH

1349
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:30,072
YOU TO THE FINAL THREE AND WHICH
TWO PLAYERS YOU LEAVE BEHIND TO

1350
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:33,643
BATTLE IN A DO-OR-DIE
FIRE-MAKING CHALLENGE FOR THAT

1351
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:34,777
THIRD AND FINAL SPOT.

1352
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:40,516
THERE IS A LOT RIDING ON THIS
CHALLENGE.

1353
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:48,691
GOOD LUCK.

1354
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:49,892
ALL RIGHT.

1355
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:50,760
HERE WE GO.

1356
01:03:50,793 --> 01:03:53,262
EVERYBODY GRAB YOUR FIRST BALL.

1357
01:03:53,296 --> 01:04:00,203
AND DROP IT IN.

1358
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:04,607
THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.

1359
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:08,945
IT IS THE FINAL CHALLENGE OF THE
SEASON, AND WE HAVE THREE

1360
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:13,983
GOLIATHS AND ONE DAVID BATTLING
FOR A GUARANTEED SPOT AT THE

1361
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:16,586
FINAL THREE.

1362
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:22,658
THE KEY TO THIS CHALLENGE IS
THAT GATE IN THE MIDDLE.

1363
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,862
ITS GOING TO SEND ONE BALL TO
THE RIGHT AND THEN THE NEXT BALL

1364
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:28,965
TO THE LEFT.

1365
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:30,533
ITS EASY WITH JUST ONE BALL.

1366
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:33,102
BUT AS YOU GET ADDITIONAL BALLS
GOING.

1367
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:41,310
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER, RIGHT,
LET, RIGHT, LEFT.

1368
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:45,081
IN A MOMENT YOURE GOING TO ADD
A SECOND BALL, SO START THINKING

1369
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:46,249
ABOUT IT.

1370
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:49,085
THIS CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE
ALL ABOUT PACING, WHERE YOU

1371
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:52,455
PLACE THAT SECOND BALL.

1372
01:04:52,488 --> 01:04:53,656
ALL RIGHT.

1373
01:04:53,689 --> 01:04:58,027
YOU HAVE 15 SECONDS, ANY TIME IN
THAT WINDOW YOU CAN ADD YOUR

1374
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:04,166
SECOND BALL.

1375
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,034

01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:20,436
IN A MOMENT YOURE GOING TO ADD
A FOURTH BALL.

1413
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:27,810
YOU WILL HAVE ANOTHER 15 SECOND-
WINDOW.

JUST LIKE THAT IT IS OVER.

1423
01:07:49,865 --> 01:07:55,571
OH, MY GOD.

1424
01:07:55,604 --> 01:07:59,475
Jeff: WHAT HAPPENED, KARA?

1425
01:07:59,508 --> 01:08:03,045
YOU SAID 15 SECONDS AND I WAS
TRYING TO TIME IT OUT AND I

1426
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:08,884
FORGOT I WAS MANAGING THREE
BALLS.

1427
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:13,589
ITS LIKE THIS GAME, YOU LOOK
ASIDE FOR A SECOND AND THEN YOUR

1428
01:08:13,622 --> 01:08:15,658
CHANCE AT IMMUNITY IS GONE.

1429
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:18,828
IT SUCKS THAT THIS IS THE
CHALLENGE THAT I FELT LIKE I

1430
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:20,296
COULD DO AND THEN I FAILED.

1431
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:25,134
I JUST FAILED MYSELF.

1432
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:28,070
Jeff: NICK, THE OTHER END
OF THE SPECTRUM, WHAT DOES IT

1433
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:32,608
FEEL LIKE RIGHT NOW, ALL OF THE
TIME YOUVE SPENT WANTING TO GET

1434
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:35,344
ON THE SHOW, YOURE OUT HERE
NOW, AND YOUVE DONE IT?

1435
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:40,149
IT FEELS AMAZING, HONESTLY,
LIKE IVE WANTED TO BE OUT HERE

1436
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:44,220
FOR YEARS, AND I DID NOT WANT
THIS CHALLENGE, I WANT SOMETHING

1437
01:08:44,253 --> 01:08:48,224
LICK A PUZZLE OR SOMETHING IM
GOOD AT, BUT I THINK IVE OFTEN

1438
01:08:48,257 --> 01:08:51,193
BEEN UNDERESTIMATED IN MY LIFE,
AND TODAY I THINK I

1439
01:08:51,227 --> 01:08:52,394
UNDERESTIMATED MYSELF.

1440
01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:55,498
AND I WAS ABLE TO OVERCOME, THAT
AND I REALLY CANT BELIEVE I

1441
01:08:55,531 --> 01:08:56,465
WON.

1442
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:58,200
I CANT EVEN EXPLAIN HOW HAPPY I
AM RIGHT NOW.

1443
01:08:58,234 --> 01:08:59,969
Jeff: COME ON OVER.

1444
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:05,174
FOR THE THIRD TIME, INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY IS YOUR, AND THIS ONE

1445
01:09:05,207 --> 01:09:05,975
IS SPECIAL.

1446
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:07,543
YOU HAVE MADE IT TO THE FINAL
THREE.

1447
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:10,513
YOU WILL GET CHANCE TO PLEAD
YOUR CASE TO THE JURY ABOUT WHY

1448
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:14,650
YOU DESERVE TO WIN THIS GAME, AN
YOURE GOING TO DECIDE WHICH ONE

1449
01:09:14,683 --> 01:09:18,721
OF THESE THREE, ANGELINA, KARA,
AND MIKE, YOU CHOOSE TO BRING

1450
01:09:18,754 --> 01:09:23,792
WITH YOU AS YOUR COMPETITION AND
WHICH TWO YOU FORCE TO COMPETE

1451
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:27,029
IN A FIRE-MAKING CHALLENGE TO
EARN THEIR SPOT.

1452
01:09:27,062 --> 01:09:29,932
IM SURE YOURE GOING TO BE A
VERY POPULAR GUY BACK AT CAMP

1453
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:30,399
THIS AFTERNOON.

1454
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:31,600
YEAH, I RECKON.

1455
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:33,169
Jeff: GRAB YOUR STUFF.

1456
01:09:33,202 --> 01:09:34,003
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1457
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:36,839
SEE YOU GUYS TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

1458
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:38,107
THANKS, JEFF.

1459
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:43,445
APPRECIATE IT.

1460
01:09:58,227 --> 01:09:58,661
WOW.

1461
01:09:58,694 --> 01:09:59,295
GOOD JOB, NICK.

1462
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:04,333
HIGH-FIVE.

1463
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:05,768
DONT LEAVE ME HANGING.

1464
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:10,539
NICK WINS HIS THIRD IMMUNITY
NECKLACE IN A ROW, WHICH IS

1465
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:15,044
AMAZING FOR ME, BECAUSE HES MY
ALLY, SO HIS WINNING IS MY

1466
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:16,845
WINNING, TOO.

1467
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,180
WANT TO GET PITCHED.

1468
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:18,814
Jeff:
 YEAH.

1469
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:20,382
POPULAR MAN.

1470
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:23,786
OF COURSE, EVERYONE WANTS TO
GIVE NICK THEIR FINAL PITCH IN

1471
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:27,022
TERMS OF WHY HE SHOULD TAKE THEM
TO THE FINAL THREE.

1472
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:28,724
ITS YOUR GAME TO LOSE.

1473
01:10:28,757 --> 01:10:29,959
I THINK SO.

1474
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:34,196
IT IS THE PERFECT TWIST THAT
THE FINAL DAVID HOLDS THE FATE

1475
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,966
OF THREE GOLIATHS IN HIS HANDS.

1476
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:41,203
I HONESTLY DONT KNOW WHAT
THE PERCEPTION IS OF ME, BUT

1477
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:45,074
THOSE CHICKS WILL BE GOING FOR
THE MONEY AND TRYING TO, YOU

1478
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:46,842
KNOW, WHATEVER, SPIN WHATEVER
THEYRE SPINNING.

1479
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:48,844
IM GOING TO COME IN ON A
DIFFERENT ANGLE.

1480
01:10:48,877 --> 01:10:51,180
MY GAME IS KIND OF PLAIN JANE.

1481
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:56,085
I THINK THE JURY IS LIKE, KARA
GOT DRAGGED IN THE END.

1482
01:10:56,118 --> 01:10:59,521
IM GETTING ALL THESE
PITCHES, AND THEY SAY THERE IS

1483
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:01,056
NO WAY THEY CAN WIN THE GAME.

1484
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,659
OF COURSE THEYRE GOING TO TELL
ME, THAT BECAUSE THEY WANT ME TO

1485
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:04,593
TAKE THEM.

1486
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:10,199
ITS EASY, TAKE ME AND HAVE
ANGELINA FIRE.

1487
01:11:10,232 --> 01:11:13,068
PEOPLE LIKE ME, BUT I DONT
HAVE A GAME TO BACK IT UP.

1488
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:15,638
YOU CANT TRUST ANYONE,
ESPECIALLY ON DAY 38.

1489
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:19,041
THIS IS THE TIME TO USE MY
DECISION FOR ME AND MY GAME.

1490
01:11:19,074 --> 01:11:22,845
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I WANT
WHOEVER GOES HOME TODAY TO VOTE

1491
01:11:22,878 --> 01:11:25,047
FOR ME AND GIVE ME THE $1
MILLION.

1492
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,216
ARE YOU HERE TO MAKE AN
ANNOUNCEMENT?

1493
01:11:27,249 --> 01:11:27,850
YEAH.

1494
01:11:27,883 --> 01:11:29,151
IF YOU GUYS WANT TO KNOW?

1495
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:32,588
I THINK THE MOST LIKELY WAY I
CAN LOSE TOMORROW IS IF IM

1496
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:34,390
SITTING WITH YOU AND WITH YOU.

1497
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:38,727
SO IF I GO AHEAD AND TAKE
ANGELINA, THEN ONE OF YOU WONT

1498
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:39,261
BE THERE.

1499
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,230
IM A CLOSER.

1500
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:42,364
IM PERSUASIVE.

1501
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:46,168
AND I HAVE SUCCESSFULLY
PERSUADED NICK TO TAKE ME TO THE

1502
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:47,469
END WITH HIM.

1503
01:11:47,503 --> 01:11:50,673
CONGRATS TO YOU TWO.

1504
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:51,874
CONGRATS.

1505
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:54,410
MIKE AND KARA MIGHT WANT TO
SAY THAT NICK IS GOING TO TAKE

1506
01:11:54,443 --> 01:12:01,250
THE WEAKEST PLAYER, BUT I DO
BELIEVE I CAN WIN THIS GAME.

1507
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:05,454
SO ITS THE FIRST TIME ITS
SINKING IN.

1508
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:07,923
AFTER EVERYTHING IVE BEEN
THROUGH, SUPER PROUD OF MYSELF.

1509
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:10,526
WANT ME TO GO FIRST, MIKE?

1510
01:12:10,559 --> 01:12:11,560
SURE.

1511
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:14,363
MIKE AND I ARE GOING THE
FIGHT IT OUT IN FIRE.

1512
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:17,866
ITS TOUGH, BUT AT LEAST THIS IS
MY SHOT TO GET INTO THE FINAL

1513
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,735
THREE PROVING MY WAY THERE.

1514
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:22,838
I AM SO FREAKING CLOSE.

1515
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:25,174
THE PRESSURE IS ON.

1516
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:28,777
BUT IM READY FOR IT AND IM NOT
GOING TO GO OUT TONIGHT WITHOUT

1517
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:30,746
FIGHTING.

1518
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:31,547
WOW.

1519
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:32,781
AWESOME.

1520
01:12:32,815 --> 01:12:35,317
THE PLAYERS IN THIS GAME HAVE
UNDERESTIMATED ME AND MY GAME

1521
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:39,988
THIS ENTIRE TIME.

1522
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:40,422
IM A GOLIATH.

1523
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:41,557
I DONT GIVE UP.

1524
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:44,660
NO MATTER WHAT SITUATION IM
FACED WITH, IM GOING TO GET

1525
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:49,298
PAST IT.

1526
01:12:49,331 --> 01:12:50,999
THATS QUICK, GIRL.

1527
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:54,336
AT THIS POINT IM GOING TO
WORK MY ASS OFF TO MAKE FIRE.

1528
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:55,537
I CAME HERE TO WIN.

1529
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:58,774
WOULD IT MAKE IT TO THE FLAG
IN.

1530
01:12:58,807 --> 01:13:00,008
D SAY.

1531
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:03,412
FOR ME THE FIRE-MAKING THING
HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY NIGHTMARE.

1532
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:06,882
SOMETHING ABOUT MAKING THIS FIRE
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE AND THE

1533
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:10,686
JURY IS MORE ANXIETY INDUCING
THAN ANYTHING THATS HAPPENED UP

1534
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:11,720
TO THIS POINT.

1535
01:13:11,754 --> 01:13:13,555
YOU DONT NEED TO PACK MUCH.

1536
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:14,490
YOURE NOT GOING HOME.

1537
01:13:14,523 --> 01:13:16,458
I FEEL NERVOUS ABOUT THIS.

1538
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:20,396
AND I DONT KNOW, ITS GETTING
INTO MY HEAD.

1539
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:23,565
NOW IM IN THIS ANXIETY MODE
THAT IM AFRAID OF BEING AFRAID

1540
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:24,533
ABOUT IT.

1541
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:25,768
I DONT THINK ANYONE THINKS IM
GOING TO WIN.

1542
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:28,203
THIS I HAVE NEVER FELT MORE LIKE
A DAVID.

1543
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:34,343
I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO SUMMON MY
INNER GOLIATH, CRUSH THIS DAVID

1544
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:38,747
UNDERDOG FEEL AND JUST GO IN

YOU HAVE GOTTEN TO THE FINAL

1559
01:14:21,056 --> 01:14:24,593
I MEAN, I ALWAYS THOUGHT
TEARS OF JOY WAS LIKE AN

1560
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:28,330
EXPRESSION THAT PEOPLE SAY, BUT
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE, I

1561
01:14:28,363 --> 01:14:31,266
ACTUALLY CRIED TEARS OF JOY.

1562
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:34,136
Jeff: NICK, PART OF WINNING
THAT FINAL CHALLENGE IS YOU HAVE

1563
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:35,370
POWER.

1564
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:38,240
YOU DECIDE TONIGHT WHO SITS NEXT
TO YOU IN ONE OF THE SPOTS AND

1565
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:41,076
WHICH OTHER TWO PEOPLE HAVE TO
FIGHT FOR FIRE.

1566
01:14:41,109 --> 01:14:42,311
THATS RIGHT.

1567
01:14:42,344 --> 01:14:44,713
AND WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT
RESPONSIBILITY, SO, YOU KNOW,

1568
01:14:44,746 --> 01:14:49,852
THE TEARS OF JOY VERY QUICKLY
TURNED INTO, OH, MAN, IM IN A

1569
01:14:49,885 --> 01:14:51,019
SPOT HERE.

1570
01:14:51,053 --> 01:14:54,022
Jeff: KARA, ITS REALLY
INTERESTING WHEN YOU GET TO THIS

1571
01:14:54,056 --> 01:14:56,925
PHASE OF THE GAME, ALL OF THOSE
THINGS THAT WERE ASSETS YOU NOW

1572
01:14:56,959 --> 01:15:00,062
TURN INTO, YOU KNOW, I REALLY
WOULDNT GET ANY VOTES, I DIDNT

1573
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:01,163
PLAY MUCH OF A GAME?

1574
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:04,032
RIGHT, YOURE PROUD OF THE
GAME YOU PLAYED, BUT IM

1575
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:07,302
PITCHING TO NICK LIKE, I DIDNT
REALLY DO MUCH OF ANYTHING, TAKE

1576
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:08,737
ME, YOU CAN WIN OVER ME.

1577
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:11,673
Jeff: ANGELINA, ITS ALMOST
LIKE NOBODY WANTS TO GIVE AWAY

1578
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:14,343
ANYTHING MORE THAN THEY HAVE TO,
BECAUSE MAYBE NICK HASNT MADE

1579
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:15,244
UP HIS MIND YET.

1580
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:17,746
WE THINK THAT NICK HAS MADE
UP HIS MIND.

1581
01:15:17,779 --> 01:15:20,983
HE WAS COOL ENOUGH AT CAMP TO
LET US KNOW WHO HE INTENDS TO

1582
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:24,353
SAVE, BUT, OF COURSE, ITS NOT
FINAL UNTIL HE TELLS YOU WHAT HE

1583
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:25,754
INTENDS TO DO TONIGHT.

1584
01:15:25,787 --> 01:15:26,889
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, NICK.

1585
01:15:26,922 --> 01:15:29,558
WHO ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE WITH
YOU TO THE FINAL THREE?

1586
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:34,863
WELL, I THINK I HAVE THE
LEAST PROBABILITY OF WINNING THE

1587
01:15:34,897 --> 01:15:39,868
GAME IF IM SITTING NEXT TO BOTH
MIKE AND KARA, SO FOR THAT

1588
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:43,038
REASON, IT WOULD MAKE THE MOST
SENSE FOR ME TO TAKE ANGELINA TO

1589
01:15:43,071 --> 01:15:44,106
THE FINAL THREE.

1590
01:15:44,139 --> 01:15:46,441
Jeff: SO ANGELINA,
CONGRATULATION, YOUVE MADE IT

1591
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:47,009
TO THE FINAL THREE.

1592
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:49,978
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

1593
01:15:50,012 --> 01:15:51,446
Jeff: HOW DOES THAT FEEL
IN.

1594
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:55,684
IT FEELS SURREAL, IM SUPER
GRATEFUL TO NICK.

1595
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:56,718
ITS INDESCRIBABLE.

1596
01:15:56,752 --> 01:16:00,289
Jeff: SO THAT LEAVES US
WITH MIKE AND KARA.

1597
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:03,025
BEFORE WE GET TO IT, HOW
CONFIDENT ARE YOU, KARA?

1598
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:07,129
I HONESTLY THINK THAT ITS
GOING TO BE A GREAT COMPETITION

1599
01:16:07,162 --> 01:16:07,796
TONIGHT.

1600
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:08,931
ITS GOING TO BE A GOOD SHOW.

1601
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:12,968
Jeff: MIKE, THAT GOT A
WEIRD REACTION, YOUR FACE DID

1602
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:14,069
LIKE 50 DIFFERENT TWITCHES.

1603
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:16,939
IM HOPING IF I LOSE I LOSE
QUICKLY.

1604
01:16:16,972 --> 01:16:19,241
BUT I HOPE I DO WELL.

1605
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:19,942
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1606
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:22,344
SO IT IS TIME TO GET TO IT.

1607
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:23,412
TAKE YOUR SPOTS.

1608
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:25,781
KARA, YOULL BE ON ORANGE.

1609
01:16:25,814 --> 01:16:32,854
MIKE, YOULL BE ON PURPLE.

1610
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:33,956
DONT REACH IN YET.

1611
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:34,890
OKAY.

1612
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:37,426
YOU EACH HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF
SUPPLIES.

1613
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:38,660
THE GOAL IS REALLY SIMPLE.

1614
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:42,297
BUILD A FIRE THAT IS HIGH ENOUGH
AND HOT ENOUGH TO BURN THROUGH

1615
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:43,799
THE ROPE AND RAISE THE FLAG.

1616
01:16:43,832 --> 01:16:48,203
THE FIRST TO DO IT BECOMES THE
THIRD AND FINAL MEMBER OF THE

1617
01:16:48,236 --> 01:16:49,438
FINAL THREE.

1618
01:16:49,471 --> 01:16:51,740
THE ONE WHO DOESNT BECOMES THE
TENTH AND FINAL MEMBER OF THE

1619
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:53,041
JURY.

1620
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:56,745
THIS IS A DO-OR-DIE CHALLENGE.

1621
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:57,813
ARE YOU BOTH READY MANY.

1622
01:16:57,846 --> 01:16:58,914
YES.

1623
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:00,782
YES.

1624
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:04,386
Jeff: GOOD LUCK AND BEGIN.

1625
01:17:04,419 --> 01:17:07,255
THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE.

1626
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:11,493
38 DAYS IN THE MAKING COMES DOWN
TO THIS, NICK AND ANGELINA

1627
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:13,295
ALREADY IN THE FINAL THREE.

1628
01:17:13,328 --> 01:17:17,299
WERE LOOKING FOR ONE MORE.

1629
01:17:17,332 --> 01:17:21,503
BOTH MIKE AND KARA QUICKLY START
SCRAPING MAGNESIUM.

1630
01:17:21,536 --> 01:17:29,011
THATS WHAT YOURE GOING TO TRY
TO IGNITE TO CATCH THAT PUFF.

1631
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:33,448
BOTH AT THE SAME TIME START
GOING TO GET A SPARK.

1632
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:38,120
KARA HAS THE FIRST FLAME.

1633
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:39,855
IT GOES OUT.

1634
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:41,189
THOSE FLAMES CAN GO OUT QUICKLY.

1635
01:17:41,223 --> 01:17:44,693
YOU GOT TO GET THEM TO CATCH.

1636
01:17:44,726 --> 01:17:48,063
MIKE WORKING TO GET SOMETHING
GOING.

1637
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:49,665
HES HAVING TROUBLE GETTING A
SPARK NOW.

1638
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:52,434
THERE IT IS.

1639
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:54,202
MIKES GOT A LITTLE FLAME.

1640
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:57,906
CAN HE THURSDAY CHUR IT WITHOUT
BLOWING IT OUT.

1641
01:17:57,939 --> 01:18:00,075
MIKE TRYING TO KEEP IT GOING
THAT.

1642
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:03,278
FLAME NOW STARTING TO GET A
LITTLE MOMENTUM, BUT IT IS STILL

1643
01:18:03,311 --> 01:18:03,812
EARLY.

1644
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:04,813
KARA STILL HAS A SHOT.

1645
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:07,149
MIKE HAS A LONG WAY FROM THAT
ROPE.

1646
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:11,953
NOW HES GOING TO TRY TO BUILD A
STRUCTURE THAT WILL TAKE THAT

1647
01:18:11,987 --> 01:18:13,855
FLAME ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP OF
THAT ROPE.

1648
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:17,392
YOU DONT WANT TO GET A FIRE AND
LOSE IT.

1649
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:20,362
MIKE HAS NOT MADE A LOT OF
PROBLEM, HES TRYING TO KEEP

1650
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:23,398
THAT BASE GOING SO IT DOESNT GO
OUT, BUT IF HE DOESNT GET IT

1651
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:28,770
GOING SOON, IT MIGHT.

1652
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:31,840
THATS THE OPENING FOR KARA.

1653
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:33,241
KARA AGAIN TRYING TO GET A
SPARK.

1654
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:34,810
SHES GOT MORE MAGNESIUM.

1655
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:38,647
SHES GOT TO IGNITE IT.

1656
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:42,718
KARAS GOT A FLAME NOW.

1657
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:44,319
AND IT GOES OUT.

1658
01:18:44,352 --> 01:18:50,692
PIECE BY PIECE MIKE CONTINUES TO
GROW HIS FIRE RIGHT NEXT TO HIM

1659
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:51,960
KARA CONTINUES TO TRY TO GET
FIRE.

1660
01:18:51,993 --> 01:18:53,095
DO NOT GIVE UP.

1661
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:56,832
THIS COULD VERY WELL BE A
MILLION DOLLAR FIRE YOU ARE

1662
01:18:56,865 --> 01:18:58,100
MAKING.

1663
01:18:58,133 --> 01:19:01,737
MIKE HAS A NICE FIRE GOING, BUT
THAT FIRE DOES HAVE TO GROW HIGH

1664
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:04,406
ENOUGH TO REACH THAT ROPE.

1665
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:05,207
KARA STILL FIGHTING.

1666
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,442
SHES GOT A LITTLE FLAME.

1667
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:09,911
GOES OUT AGAIN.

1668
01:19:09,945 --> 01:19:11,113
MIKES FLAME GROWING MORE NOW.

1669
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:14,182
ITS STARTING TO BURN THROUGH
THE ROPE.

1670
01:19:14,216 --> 01:19:15,050
MIKE CAN SEE IT.

1671
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:17,085
HES EYEING IT.

1672
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:20,322
KARA CONTINUES TO TRY.

1673
01:19:20,355 --> 01:19:21,256
IT WONT MATTER.

1674
01:19:21,289 --> 01:19:22,791
MIKE DOES IT.

1675
01:19:22,824 --> 01:19:24,593
MIKE MAKES FIRE.

1676
01:19:24,626 --> 01:19:26,061
WOW.

1677
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:30,966
MIKE WILL JOIN NICK AND ANGELINA
IN THE FINAL THREE.

1678
01:19:30,999 --> 01:19:36,104
KARA, AFTER 38 DAYS BECOMES THE
FINAL MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

1679
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:44,513
WHAT A TIEBREAKER.

1680
01:19:44,546 --> 01:19:46,982
YOU KNOW WHAT MIKE IS FEELING,
KARA, WHAT ARE YOU FEELING?

1681
01:19:47,015 --> 01:19:49,451
OH, ITS JUST A FEELING OF
DEFEAT.

1682
01:19:49,484 --> 01:19:53,755
YOU KNOW, IM SPYING THROUGH THE
ADVERSITY, BUT IT SUCKS TO KNOW

1683
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:55,223

01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:20,141
I DID EXACTLY THAT.

1714
01:21:33,989 --> 01:21:36,625
I CANT BEAVER ITS US.

1715
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:37,626
DAY 39.

1716
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:38,059
WERE STILL HERE.

1717
01:21:38,093 --> 01:21:42,130
OH, MY GOD.

1718
01:21:42,163 --> 01:21:43,064
I LOVE YOU GUYS.

1719
01:21:43,098 --> 01:21:44,366
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT?

1720
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:45,367
I DIDNT.

1721
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,036
YOU AND I HAVE BEEN TOGETHER
THE ENTIRE TIME.

1722
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:49,070
THATS TRUE.

1723
01:21:49,104 --> 01:21:54,476
I LIKE YOU GUYS SO MUCH.

1724
01:21:54,509 --> 01:21:56,411
I CAN BARELY BELIEVE IM IN THE
FINAL THREE.

1725
01:21:56,444 --> 01:21:59,514
I HEAR IT COMING OUT OF MY MOUTH
BUT IT DOESNT FEEL REAL.

1726
01:21:59,547 --> 01:22:00,849
ITS A DREAM COME TRUE.

1727
01:22:00,882 --> 01:22:02,817
ITS STILL SINKING IN.

1728
01:22:02,851 --> 01:22:04,786
DAY 39.

1729
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:06,588
Jeff: OH, WOW.

1730
01:22:06,621 --> 01:22:10,225
EVEN THOUGH I HAVE ALL THE
LOVE IN THE WORLD FOR NICK AND

1731
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:12,661
MIKE, TODAY THEY ARE MY BIGGEST
COMPETITORS.

1732
01:22:12,694 --> 01:22:16,231
THEYVE PLAY TOUGH GAME, BUT ME
BEING A GOLIATH, I HAVE THIS

1733
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:18,300
DRIVE INSIDE OF ME.

1734
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:21,369
AND I FOUGHT TOOTH AND NAIL TO
MAKE IT TO THE END AS A STRONG

1735
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:22,604
PLAYER.

1736
01:22:22,637 --> 01:22:26,107
THIS GAME TESTED ME MORE THAN
ANYONE ELSE IN THE FINAL THREE.

1737
01:22:26,141 --> 01:22:28,243
AND TAUGHT ME, I DONT HAVE TO
BE PERFECT.

1738
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:31,046
I DONT HAVE TO BE POLISHED ALL
THE TIME.

1739
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:35,383
I DONT HAVE TO BE MADE UP ALL
THE TIME.

1740
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:42,123
I CAN JUST BE ME AND THAT IM SO
CAPABLE OF ANYTHING.

1741
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:43,158
BREAKFAST.

1742
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:49,431
DAY 39 "SURVIVOR" BREAKFAST.

1743
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:50,565
WAFFLE, EGG, CHAMPAGNE.

1744
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:55,570
DAY 39 IS SO SURREAL.

1745
01:22:55,603 --> 01:22:57,639
ALL WE HAVE LEFT IS ONE TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

1746
01:22:57,672 --> 01:23:00,642
IT MADE ME SO PROUD OF THE GAME
IVE PLAYEDEN I FOUGHT HARD TO

1747
01:23:00,675 --> 01:23:01,509
GET HERE.

1748
01:23:01,543 --> 01:23:06,915
IM NOT GOING TO NOT BE PROUD OF
MYSELF.

1749
01:23:06,948 --> 01:23:10,585
TO DO IT AS AN UNDERDOG IS A
BADGE OF HONOR, AS WELL.

1750
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:12,253
IM PROUD TO BE THE LAST DAVID
IN THE GAME.

1751
01:23:12,287 --> 01:23:13,755
SO AWESOME.

1752
01:23:13,788 --> 01:23:14,889
I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH.

1753
01:23:14,923 --> 01:23:15,991
BUBBLY.

1754
01:23:16,024 --> 01:23:17,425
DAY 39.

1755
01:23:17,459 --> 01:23:18,093
FINAL THREE.

1756
01:23:18,126 --> 01:23:19,327
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A DAVID.

1757
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:22,998
I WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE ONLY
KIDS IN LAW SCHOOL THAT GREW UP

1758
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:25,800
IN A TRAILER, BUT IT MADE ME WHO
I AM.

1759
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:28,603
IT MADE ME LEARN HOW TO MAKE
MYSELF BE SOMEBODY.

1760
01:23:28,636 --> 01:23:30,038
THATS THE THING ABOUT
"SURVIVOR."

1761
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:32,640
I HAD TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS AT
THE RIGHT TIME.

1762
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:35,243
HIDE THE GO FIND ADVANTAGE, WIN
IMMUNITY.

1763
01:23:35,276 --> 01:23:39,614
I HAVE HAD TO DO EVERYTHING OUT
MERE OTHER THAN A BACK PHILLIP.

1764
01:23:39,647 --> 01:23:41,816
TONIGHT ONE OF THE BIGGEST
NIGHTS OF MY LIFE, BECAUSE I

1765
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,752
HAVE CHANCE TO WIN $1 MILLION
TONIGHT.

1766
01:23:43,785 --> 01:23:46,621
WHEN DOES THAT EVER HAPPEN TO
SOME COUNTRY BOY FROM

1767
01:23:46,654 --> 01:23:53,194
SOUTHEASTERN KENTUCKY, YOU KNOW?

1768
01:23:53,228 --> 01:23:57,565
DAVID VERSUS GOLIATH IS AN
EPIC STORY, AND AS A STORYTELLER

1769
01:23:57,599 --> 01:24:01,669
WHO LOVES THIS GAME, I WANTED TO
BE HERE FOR EVERY BIT OF IT, AND

1770
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:03,838
I WAS, AND IM STILL IN IT.

1771
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:08,076
FOR ME, LIFE IS ABOUT PUSHING
MYSELF, SO I WANTED TO COME OUT

1772
01:24:08,109 --> 01:24:12,847
HERE AND SEE HOW I FARED, AND
NOT ONLY DID I STOMACH IT, BUT I

1773
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:13,715
LIKED IT.

1774
01:24:13,748 --> 01:24:18,520
I FIFTH FIFTH FELT ALIVE.

1775
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:21,256
AT THIS AGE, THATS WHAT YOU
WANT, YOU WANT THE FEEL LIKE

1776
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:23,024
YOURE LEAVING IT ALL OUT ON THE
ISLAND.

1777
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:24,259
I FEEL LIKE I DID.

1778
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:27,529
I FEEL LIKE I LEFT IT OUT ON THE
ISLAND AND IM GOING THE TAKE

1779
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:30,899
THAT LESSON AND LIVE THE REST OF
MY LIFE THAT WAY.

1780
01:24:30,932 --> 01:24:33,134
OTHER PEOPLE PLAYED BETTER
PHYSICAL GAMES.

1781
01:24:33,168 --> 01:24:36,604
I DIDNT COMPETE IN THAT WAY,
BUT I DO THINK MY SOCIAL GAME

1782
01:24:36,638 --> 01:24:38,073
WAS KIND OF INSPIRED.

1783
01:24:38,106 --> 01:24:40,809
YOU KNOW, I WASNT THE ONE AT
THE WHEELS, BECAUSE THE PERSON

1784
01:24:40,842 --> 01:24:44,579
AT THE WHEEL ALWAYS GOT THEIR
HEAD CHOPPED OFF THE NEXT DAY,

1785
01:24:44,612 --> 01:24:48,049
BUT I WAS BEHIND THE DRIVER
SAYING, YOU MIGHT WANT TO TURN

1786
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:51,586
LEFT, YOU MIGHT WANT TO TURN
RIGHT, AND THE CAR WENT TO WAY I

1787
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:52,287
WANTED IT TO GO.

1788
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,655
I CAN TAKE CREDIT FOR THAT.

1789
01:24:53,688 --> 01:24:56,925
TONIGHT I HAVE TO MAKE SURE
EVERYONE ON THE JURY SEES THAT,

1790
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:58,393
BECAUSE THE STORY IS NOT OVER.

1791
01:24:58,426 --> 01:24:59,828
AND I HAVE GOT TO WIN.

1792
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:01,696
I CAME HERE TO PLAY A GAME.

1793
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:02,630
I AM COMPETITIVE.

1794
01:25:02,664 --> 01:25:05,300
IM NOT HERE TO MAKE IT TO THE
END.

1795
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:16,611
IM HERE TO WIN THE GAME.

1796
01:25:20,014 --> 01:25:24,085
Jeff: WELL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1797
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:35,196
ELIZABETH, JOHN, DAN, ALEC,
CARL, GABBY, CHRISTIAN, DAVIE,

1798
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:41,903
ALISON, AND KARA, WHO LOST IN
THE FIRE-MAKING CHALLENGE.

1799
01:25:41,936 --> 01:25:43,671
ALL RIGHT.

1800
01:25:43,705 --> 01:25:46,541
WELCOME TO YOUR FINAL TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

1801
01:25:46,574 --> 01:25:50,778
SO WE STARTED THIS SEASON WITH
TWO GROUPS, DAVIDS AND GOLIATHS.

1802
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:53,448
FITTINGLY WE HAVE MEMBERS OF
EACH GROUP STILL IN THE GAME.

1803
01:25:53,481 --> 01:25:56,684
AT VARIOUS TIMES THROUGHOUT THE
SEASON, YOU HAVE ALL DESCRIBED

1804
01:25:56,718 --> 01:26:00,688
THIS GAME PLAY AS FLUID, THAT
ALLIANCES AND THE STYLE OF PLAY

1805
01:26:00,722 --> 01:26:02,257
WOULD SHIFT FROM DAY TO DAY.

1806
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:06,060
AND WE SAW THAT FLUIDITY WHEN IT
CAME TO INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY

1807
01:26:06,094 --> 01:26:07,228
CHALLENGES.

1808
01:26:07,262 --> 01:26:09,063
THERE WERE TEN INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY CHALLENGES THIS SEASON.

1809
01:26:09,097 --> 01:26:11,132
EIGHT OF THEM WERE WON BY
DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

1810
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:15,003
THATS 80% OF THE CHALLENGES WON
BY A DIFFERENT PERSON.

1811
01:26:15,036 --> 01:26:18,306
WE STARTED THE SEASON WITH THE
PREMISE THAT EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE

1812
01:26:18,339 --> 01:26:20,775
DAVIDS AND GOLIATHS ITS NOT
ABOUT WHO HAS THE ADVANTAGE, THE

1813
01:26:20,808 --> 01:26:24,379
QUESTION IS ALWAYS, WHAT IS THE
ADVANTAGE.

1814
01:26:24,412 --> 01:26:27,916
AND HERE WE ARE WITH A FINAL
THREE, EVERY ONE OF YOU POLICE

1815
01:26:27,949 --> 01:26:30,385
DEPARTMENT A DIFFERENT TYPE OF
GAME, AND AT VARIOUS POINTS IN

1816
01:26:30,418 --> 01:26:34,088
THE GAME, YOU FIGURED OUT WHAT
THE ADVANTAGE WAS IN A GIVEN

1817
01:26:34,122 --> 01:26:36,991
SITUATION AND YOU CAPITALIZED ON
THAT.

1818
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:40,562
AND TONIGHT, IN THAT CONTEXT,
THE JURY WILL NOW DECIDE WHICH

1819
01:26:40,595 --> 01:26:44,132
ONE OF THE THREE OF YOU THEY
THINK PLAYED THE BEST OVERALL

1820
01:26:44,165 --> 01:26:49,204
GAME AND IS MOST DESERVING OF
THE TITLE OF SOLE SURVIVOR AND

1821
01:26:49,237 --> 01:26:50,238
THE MILLION DOLLAR PRIZE.

1822
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:56,744
ILL GIVE YOU GUYS A MOMENT AND
WELL GET STARTED.

1823
01:27:02,951 --> 01:27:03,785
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1824
01:27:03,818 --> 01:27:05,653
ITS TIME TO GET TO FINAL TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

1825
01:27:05,687 --> 01:27:08,489
WE WILL START WITH THE OUTWIT
PORTION OF THE GAME.

1826
01:27:08,523 --> 01:27:14,295
THIS IS THE SOCIAL PART OF THE
GAME, ALLIANCES YOU HAD, HOW YOU

1827
01:27:14,329 --> 01:27:17,365
DEALT WITH BLINDSIDE, THE
EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE.

1828
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:18,433
WHO WANTS TO GET US STARTED?

1829
01:27:18,466 --> 01:27:20,101
THAT WOULD BE ME, JEFF.

1830
01:27:20,134 --> 01:27:22,704
FIRST OF ALL, I WANTED TO SAY
CONGRATULATIONS.

1831
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:24,706
YOU THREE WERE ABLE TO DO WHAT
WE WERE NOT.

1832
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:26,874
EACH OF YOU HAVE A LOT TO BE
PROUD OF.

1833
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:30,612
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT ALMOST
ALL OF US ARE UNDECIDED.

1834
01:27:30,645 --> 01:27:34,616
SO I REALLY WANT YALL TO CUT
THE CRAP, ALL RIGHT, AND YOU

1835
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:37,452
DONT HAVE TO BE POLISHED, JUST
BE REAL AND ATHEN TICK, BECAUSE

1836
01:27:37,485 --> 01:27:40,421
IF YOURE GOING A POLITICAL
ANSWER, I AINT GOING TO BE

1837
01:27:40,455 --> 01:27:41,522
SATISFIED.

1838
01:27:41,556 --> 01:27:45,727
SO DOVETAILING OFF THIS
BEAUTIFUL STATEMENT, I WOULD

1839
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:49,897
LOVE IT IF YOU WOULD ALL TAKE AN
OPPORTUNITY TO HIGHLIGHT A MOVE

1840
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:53,268
THAT YOU MADE IN THE GAME THAT
DEMONSTRATED HOW YOU OUTWITTED

1841
01:27:53,301 --> 01:27:56,371
IN SURVIVOR, AND YOU GUYS CAN GO
IN WHATEVER ORDER YOU WANT.

1842
01:27:56,404 --> 01:28:01,709
THE OUTWITHTO ME HAD TWO MAIN
FACTORS, INFORMATION AND TIMING.

1843
01:28:01,743 --> 01:28:05,280
THE INFORMATION IN MY MIND IS
THE SOCIAL DYNAMIC, THE

1844
01:28:05,313 --> 01:28:06,447
RELATIONSHIPS YOU CAN BUILD.

1845
01:28:06,481 --> 01:28:09,984
SO I WOULD HAVE ONE-ON-ONE
ALLIANCES WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE,

1846
01:28:10,018 --> 01:28:12,987
AND TO MAKE IT FUN, WE WOULD
EVEN NAME THEM.

1847
01:28:13,021 --> 01:28:16,524
CHRISTIAN, WE WERE THE
MASON-DIXON.

1848
01:28:16,557 --> 01:28:19,761
THAT WAS A WAY FOR ME TO BUILD A
PERSONAL CONNECTION WITH PEOPLE,

1849
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:22,664
AND PEOPLE WOULD TELL ME WHAT
WAS GOING ON, THATS HOW I KNOW

1850
01:28:22,697 --> 01:28:23,698
WHAT EVERY VOTE IS GOING TO BE.

1851
01:28:23,731 --> 01:28:26,301
THATS WHEN THE TIMING COMES IN.

1852
01:28:26,334 --> 01:28:28,569
SO A MOVE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT IS
WHEN JOHN WENT HOME.

1853
01:28:28,603 --> 01:28:29,971
THAT WAS A BIG MONEY MOVE.

1854
01:28:30,004 --> 01:28:34,142
I MEAN, DAVIE PLAYED HIS IDOL,
AN IDOL WAS PLAYED ON ANGELINA,

1855
01:28:34,175 --> 01:28:37,045
AND WE SPLIT A MINORITY VOTE,
FIRST TIME IN "SURVIVOR"

1856
01:28:37,078 --> 01:28:38,780
HISTORY, TWO BIG FACTORS.

1857
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:40,481
INFORMATION, TIMING.

1858
01:28:40,515 --> 01:28:43,251
YOURE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

1859
01:28:43,284 --> 01:28:44,719
SUCKS FOR ME, BUT GOOD MOVE.

1860
01:28:44,752 --> 01:28:45,219
WELL PLAYED.

1861
01:28:45,253 --> 01:28:46,454
THANK YOU.

1862
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:49,057
BUT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
THINGS IN A WRESTLING MATCH IS

1863
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:49,757
THE FINISH.

1864
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:50,925
PEOPLE REMEMBER THE BIG FINISH.

1865
01:28:50,958 --> 01:28:55,163
I FELT LIKE THE PEAK OF YOUR
SOCIAL GAME WAS RIGHT AT THAT

1866
01:28:55,196 --> 01:28:56,431
VOTE OUT.

1867
01:28:56,464 --> 01:28:59,634
CAN YOU GIVER ME ANY EXAMPLES OF
HOW YOU OUTWITTED PEOPLE DEEPER

1868
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:00,835
INTO THE GAME?

1869
01:29:00,868 --> 01:29:03,571
WELL, YOURE RIGHT, THE VOTE
AGAINST YOU WAS PROBABLY MY

1870
01:29:03,604 --> 01:29:06,974
BIGGEST MOVE, BUT AFTER THAT
MOVE, I THINK THE GOLIATHS FELT

1871
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:10,545
LIKE THEY COULDNT TRUST ME, AND
THEN CARL AND DAVIE, YALL GOT

1872
01:29:10,578 --> 01:29:12,246
BLIND SIERDED AND I DIDNT KNOW
ABOUT IT.

1873
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,415
I WAS UPSET WHEN YOU TWO WENT
HOME.

1874
01:29:14,449 --> 01:29:18,519
I WAS --
 WERE YOU WERE UPSET BECAUSE

1875
01:29:18,553 --> 01:29:23,191
YOU WERE BLINDSIDED OR WERE YOU
UPSET WHEN THEY WENT HOME?

1876
01:29:23,224 --> 01:29:24,125
BOTH.

1877
01:29:24,158 --> 01:29:25,393
I WAS OPEN FOR BUSINESS.

1878
01:29:25,426 --> 01:29:26,627
IM READY FOR EVERYBODY.

1879
01:29:26,661 --> 01:29:30,331
SO I RECONNECT WITH MY JABENI
FOLKS AND WE START MAKING MOVES

1880
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:33,234
TOGETHER.

1881
01:29:33,267 --> 01:29:37,238
IT WAS SUPER IMPRESSIVE, BUT
I WANT TO SEGUE TO MAKE AND HEAR

1882
01:29:37,271 --> 01:29:40,742
ABOUT SOME OF YOUR GAME, YOUR
OUTWIT STUFF.

1883
01:29:40,775 --> 01:29:42,009
CAN I RESPOND?

1884
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:43,878
OR DO YOU WANT TO GO AND ILL GO
AFTER?

1885
01:29:43,911 --> 01:29:45,179
NO, GO AHEAD.

1886
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:47,882
I THINK THAT I WAS IN A
SIMILAR POSITION AS NICK.

1887
01:29:47,915 --> 01:29:52,286
I WAS IN A DOGHOUSE, BECAUSE OF
THE FALLOUT WITH YOU, ELIZABETH,

1888
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,822
AND I FIFTH AMENDMENT LIKE MY
GOLIATH ALLIANCE DIDNT TRUST

1889
01:29:54,856 --> 01:29:57,892
ME, THE DAVIDS DIDNT REALLY
TRUST ME, I WAS CALLED AN

1890
01:29:57,925 --> 01:29:58,960
INSURANCE POLICY BACK AT CAMP.

1891
01:29:58,993 --> 01:30:01,896
MY REPUTATION WAS IN THE DUMPS.

1892
01:30:01,929 --> 01:30:02,864
IT MAY STILL WELL BE.

1893
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:04,599
I HOPE NOT.

1894
01:30:04,632 --> 01:30:08,102
BUT TO YOUR COMMENT, JOHN,
AROUND WRESTLING AND FINISHING

1895
01:30:08,136 --> 01:30:11,773
STRONG, I WAS ABLE TO KIND OF
PICK MYSELF UP OFF THE FLOOR AND

1896
01:30:11,806 --> 01:30:13,841
I STARTED MAKING INROADS WITH
CARL.

1897
01:30:13,875 --> 01:30:17,445
I STARTED RECONNECTING WITH
CHRISTIAN AND SO I THINK THAT MY

1898
01:30:17,478 --> 01:30:20,815
SOCIAL GAME WAS ONE THAT WAS
EXTREMELY ADAPTABLE.

1899
01:30:20,848 --> 01:30:26,254
I WAS ABLE TO KEEP YOU WITH RACE
FOR THE LAST 11 DAYS.

1900
01:30:26,287 --> 01:30:30,191
WELL, I DO HAVE TO POINT OUT
THAT THE WHOLE POINT OF A

1901
01:30:30,224 --> 01:30:31,259
SELFLESS ACT IS TO BE SELFLESS.

1902
01:30:31,292 --> 01:30:31,826
FAIR ENOUGH.

1903
01:30:31,859 --> 01:30:33,127
AND NOT BRING IT UP.

1904
01:30:33,161 --> 01:30:35,363
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU GOT RICE
FOR THE TRIBE.

1905
01:30:35,396 --> 01:30:37,098
I SHOULDNT HAVE SAID THAT.

1906
01:30:37,131 --> 01:30:39,600
THERE WERE MOMENTS WHERE I
WASNT BEING AUTHENTIC, WHERE I

1907
01:30:39,634 --> 01:30:43,704
WAS PUTTING ON A CHARADE, BUT
AGAIN, I PROMISE WELL MOVE ON.

1908
01:30:43,738 --> 01:30:46,974
I WANT TO SAY IM ABLE TO GET
MYSELF FROM THE WEAKEST POSITION

1909
01:30:47,008 --> 01:30:48,509
IN THE GAME TO ONE OF THE
STRONGEST.

1910
01:30:48,543 --> 01:30:51,379
AND YOURE SITTING THERE IN
THE FINAL THREE.

1911
01:30:51,412 --> 01:30:52,880
I STILL MADE IT HERE.

1912
01:30:52,914 --> 01:30:56,784
BUT I WANT MIKE TO GO.

1913
01:30:56,818 --> 01:31:01,088
MY PERSPECTIVE WAS I WANTED
PEOPLE WHO WERE MAKING FINAL-TWO

1914
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:02,190
DEALS WITH ME.

1915
01:31:02,223 --> 01:31:04,892
I FELT LIKE I HAD A FINAL TWO
DEAL WITH KARA, I HAD A

1916
01:31:04,926 --> 01:31:06,060
FINAL-TWO DEAL WITH ALISON.

1917
01:31:06,093 --> 01:31:09,497
I HAD A FINAL-TWO DEAL WITH
THESE TWO AND A FINAL-TWO DEAL

1918
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:10,765
WITH CHRISTIAN.

1919
01:31:10,798 --> 01:31:14,469
I WOULD APPROACH DAVIE AND CARL,
BUT I JUST FELT ON THE PERIPHERY

1920
01:31:14,502 --> 01:31:16,170
OF WHATEVER YOU WERE PLANNING.

1921
01:31:16,204 --> 01:31:19,507
AND GABBY SIMILARLY, I FELT LIKE
WHENEVER I APPROACHED YOU, LIKE

1922
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:21,576
YOU WERE NEVER REALLY GOING TO
WORK WITH ME.

1923
01:31:21,609 --> 01:31:25,646
SO I DIDNT SEE NECESSARILY YOU
AS A THREAT, I JUST FELT LIKE I

1924
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:29,083
WOULD RATHER HAVE THREATS THAT
WANTED TO WORK WITH ME THAN

1925
01:31:29,116 --> 01:31:30,251
PEOPLE WHO DIDNT.

1926
01:31:30,284 --> 01:31:32,353
YOURE RIGHT, THAT I DIDNT
TRUST YOU, BECAUSE WHAT YOU

1927
01:31:32,386 --> 01:31:35,523
SAID, YOU HAD FINAL TWO DEALS
WITH EVERYBODY AND I THOUGHT IT

1928
01:31:35,556 --> 01:31:39,160
WAS EXTREMELY TRANSPARENT, BUT
GOOD ON YOU FOR GETTING RID OF

1929
01:31:39,193 --> 01:31:40,261
SOMEBODY WHO DIDNT TRUST YOU.

1930
01:31:40,294 --> 01:31:41,829
WANTED TO GET TO THE END.

1931
01:31:41,863 --> 01:31:44,932
I FELT LIKE THAT WAS MY BEST
SHOT AT FULFILLING MY JOB HERE.

1932
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:48,503
ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE HARD
TIME WITH IS YOURE SO HUMOROUS,

1933
01:31:48,536 --> 01:31:52,406
SO WITTY AND SARCASTIC, BUT AT
TIMES YOUR SARCASM CROSSED TO

1934
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:53,174
BITING.

1935
01:31:53,207 --> 01:31:54,342
DO YOU HAVE ANY REGRETS?

1936
01:31:54,375 --> 01:31:59,180
I DO REGRET WHAT I SAID TO
YOU AT

1937
01:31:59,213 --> 01:32:03,050
YOUR DIGNITY OR WHATEVER, IT WAS
A LOW BLOW, AND HONESTLY, WHEN

1938
01:32:03,084 --> 01:32:05,753
YOU WERE GUNNING FOR ME, I WAS
HURT.

1939
01:32:05,786 --> 01:32:07,088
THATS ALL I CAN SAY.

1940
01:32:07,121 --> 01:32:10,558
THE TRUTH IS, THERE IS A PART OF
ME THAT FEELS LIKE IVE BEEN

1941
01:32:10,591 --> 01:32:11,959
CREATING A CHARACTER OUT HERE.

1942
01:32:11,993 --> 01:32:15,563
IN MY REAL LIFE, IM SOMEBODY
WHO HAS LIKE DOZENS IF NOT

1943
01:32:15,596 --> 01:32:17,298
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR
ME.

1944
01:32:17,331 --> 01:32:17,865
IM VERY INTENSE.

1945
01:32:17,899 --> 01:32:19,166
I AM REALLY COMPETITIVE.

1946
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:24,005
AND I CAME IN WANTING TO PLAY
SUPER HARD, BUT GETTING TO THE

1947
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:28,342
GOLIATH CAMP WAS A VERY HUMBLING
EXPERIENCE, BECAUSE I FELT LIKE

1948
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:32,613
THE INPROVERTED WRITER KID THAT
I HAVE NOT FELT SINCE I WAS LIKE

1949
01:32:32,647 --> 01:32:36,183
IN MIDDLE SCHOOL WHERE LIKE
EVERYONE IS AROUND THE SAME AGE,

1950
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:39,987
THEYRE ALL "BAY WATCH"
ATTRACTIVE, BIG EGO

1951
01:32:40,021 --> 01:32:42,490
PERSONALITIES, SO I STARTED
PLAYING A GAME WHICH WAS LIKE

1952
01:32:42,523 --> 01:32:44,492
IM JUST HAPPY TO BE HERE.

1953
01:32:44,525 --> 01:32:47,595
IM JUST HERE FOR THE
EXPERIENCE.

1954
01:32:47,628 --> 01:32:52,400
LIKE I CANT FIND MYSELF.

1955
01:32:52,433 --> 01:32:56,737
WHEN I GOT DOWN TO NINE PEOPLE,
I KNEW I HAD MY MOMENTS AND I

1956
01:32:56,771 --> 01:32:57,672
COULD START INFLUENCING THE
GAME.

1957
01:32:57,705 --> 01:32:58,806
GREAT ANSWER.

1958
01:32:58,839 --> 01:33:02,009
AND ALISON, IF YOU DONT
MIND, I THINK WE KNEW HE WAS

1959
01:33:02,043 --> 01:33:05,046
GOOD AND HE WAS PLAYING THE GAME
GOOD, AND I KNOW HE CAN SIT HERE

1960
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:07,081
AND WIN YOUR VOTE TONIGHT
BECAUSE HE WAS PLAYING THE GAME

1961
01:33:07,114 --> 01:33:08,316
HARD.

1962
01:33:08,349 --> 01:33:10,718
THE REASON I KNEW HE WAS DOING
IT BECAUSE I WAS DOING A BIT OF

1963
01:33:10,751 --> 01:33:12,320
THE SAME THING.

1964
01:33:12,353 --> 01:33:14,455
IM AWE SHUCKS KENTUCKY BOY AND
EVERYBODY THOUGHT I COULDNT

1965
01:33:14,488 --> 01:33:16,157
COME OUT HERE AND PLAY A GOOD
GAME.

1966
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:18,826
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME AND
MILK IS I HAD TO TURN MY GAME

1967
01:33:18,859 --> 01:33:20,094
ON.

1968
01:33:20,127 --> 01:33:22,964
I COULDNT JUST RIDE TO THE END
WITH WHATEVER GOODNIGHTS WANTED

1969
01:33:22,997 --> 01:33:24,932
ME AS THEIR LITTLE SIDE SHOW OR
WHATEVER.

1970
01:33:24,966 --> 01:33:30,137
I HAD TO TAKE MY FATE AND PUT IT
IN MY OWN HANDS.

1971
01:33:30,171 --> 01:33:30,705
OKAY.

1972
01:33:30,738 --> 01:33:32,640
ARE WE GOOD WITH SOCIAL?

1973
01:33:32,673 --> 01:33:34,475
NO?

1974
01:33:34,508 --> 01:33:35,676
Jeff: WOW.

1975
01:33:35,710 --> 01:33:36,143
OKAY.

1976
01:33:36,177 --> 01:33:37,411
LETS KEEP GOING.

1977
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:39,847
I HAVE A COMMENT TO ANGELINA
THAT I HAD BEEN WANTING TO SAY.

1978
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:41,716
I FEEL LIKE NOW THE RIGHT TIME
TO SAY IT.

1979
01:33:41,749 --> 01:33:45,019
I WANT TO GIVE YOU PROPS FOR
BEING THE LAST WOMAN LEFT, AND I

1980
01:33:45,052 --> 01:33:48,122
WANT TO BRING ATTENTION TO THE
FACT THAT WOMEN ARE TREATED

1981
01:33:48,155 --> 01:33:48,889
DIFFERENTLY IN THIS GAME.

1982
01:33:48,923 --> 01:33:50,091
THANK YOU.

1983
01:33:50,124 --> 01:33:53,361
IF YOURE ASSERTIVE, YOURE
SEEN AS BOSTON YEAR, IF YOURE

1984
01:33:53,394 --> 01:33:55,029
EMOTIONAL, YOURE SEEN AS
HYSTERICAL.

1985
01:33:55,062 --> 01:33:58,766
SO I KNOW YOURE UP AGAINST NOT
ONLY THE DIFFICULTY OF THE GAME,

1986
01:33:58,799 --> 01:34:00,534
BUT ISSUES THAT FACE US OUTSIDE
OF THE GAME.

1987
01:34:00,568 --> 01:34:02,303
I APPRECIATE THAT, GABBY.

1988
01:34:02,336 --> 01:34:07,274
I THINK TO GABBYS POINT, AS A
WOMAN AND AS A WOMAN OF COLOR, I

1989
01:34:07,308 --> 01:34:12,947
SOMETIMES OVERCOMPENSATE, IVE
BEEN TOLD I SOUND INTERVIEWEE OR

1990
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:17,218
INCENDIARY -- INCENDIARY SEAR.

1991
01:34:17,251 --> 01:34:21,689
ONE ON ONE I CAN BE MORE ME, BUT
IN A SPACE LIKE THIS ITS HARDER

1992
01:34:21,722 --> 01:34:22,990
TO DO THAT.

1993
01:34:23,024 --> 01:34:25,326
I WANT THE WRAP UP OUTWIT.

1994
01:34:25,359 --> 01:34:27,928
I WANT TO TOUCH ON EACH OF YOUR
SOCIAL GAMES.

1995
01:34:27,962 --> 01:34:30,464
NICK, COMING FROM DAVID, BEING
IN THE MINORITY, AND CULTIVATING

1996
01:34:30,498 --> 01:34:33,868
HAS TO RELATIONSHIPS AND THESE
FINAL TWO AND FINAL THREE DEALS,

1997
01:34:33,901 --> 01:34:35,703
I THINK IT WAS IMPRESSIVE.

1998
01:34:35,736 --> 01:34:37,905
ANGELINA, IT WAS INTERESTING TO
SEE YOUR EVOLUTION IN THE GAME.

1999
01:34:37,938 --> 01:34:41,108
I THINK IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST
MOVES TO MESS UP ON THE

2000
01:34:41,142 --> 01:34:44,812
ELIZABETH AND COME BACK FROM IT
AS AN UNDERDOG STORY, AND MIKE,

2001
01:34:44,845 --> 01:34:48,315
YOU PLAYED THE SOCIAL GAME THAT
I CAME HERE TO PLAY.

2002
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:49,984
IT WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE TO WATCH.

2003
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:53,454
I KNOW YOU ARE AN ACTOR, BUT I
KNOW YOURE PLAYING YOURSELF AS

2004
01:34:53,487 --> 01:34:56,557
MUCH AS YOU CAN IN THE GAME OF
"SURVIVOR," SO I WANT THE

2005
01:34:56,590 --> 01:34:57,124
CONGRATULATE YOU ON THAT.

2006
01:34:57,158 --> 01:34:58,225
THANK YOU, CARA.

2007
01:34:58,259 --> 01:35:00,594
THANKS, KARA.

2008
01:35:00,628 --> 01:35:03,230
Jeff: TIME NOW TO MOVE ON
TO THE OUTPLAY PORTION OF THE

2009
01:35:03,264 --> 01:35:04,999
GAME.

2010
01:35:05,032 --> 01:35:06,600
THIS IS THE CONDITIONS PUT ON
YOU.

2011
01:35:06,634 --> 01:35:08,069
YOU HAVE TO LIVE IN THE JUNGLE.

2012
01:35:08,102 --> 01:35:11,572
YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH IDOLS OR
ADVANTAGES AND TWISTS OR

2013
01:35:11,605 --> 01:35:12,440
SWITCHES.

2014
01:35:12,473 --> 01:35:15,276
HOW DID YOU PLAY THAT PART OF
THE GAME?

2015
01:35:15,309 --> 01:35:21,782
MIKE, THE OUTPLAY PORTION
PART OF IT IS ABOUT CAMPFIRE.

2016
01:35:21,816 --> 01:35:25,019
THE ONLY TIME WE SAW YOU AT CAMP
OTHER THAN TALKING WAS EATING

2017
01:35:25,052 --> 01:35:26,520
RICE OR DRINKING COFFEE.

2018
01:35:26,554 --> 01:35:30,524
IM PRETTY SURE HERE THE FIRST
TIME THEY SEEN YOU MAKE FIRE WAS

2019
01:35:30,558 --> 01:35:31,759
LAST NIGHT.

2020
01:35:31,792 --> 01:35:34,662
BRAVO, IT WAS IMPRESSIVE, BUT
WHERE WERE YOU WHENEVER WE WERE

2021
01:35:34,695 --> 01:35:36,197
MAKING FIRE, BUILDING SHELTER.

2022
01:35:36,230 --> 01:35:38,532
ARE YOU SAYING I WAS LAZY?

2023
01:35:38,566 --> 01:35:40,234
ARE YOU CALLING ME THE L WORD?

2024
01:35:40,267 --> 01:35:42,503
WHEN I WATCHED YOU MAKE THAT
SHELTER.

2025
01:35:42,536 --> 01:35:46,073
THERES NO WAY I COULD HAVE CUT
THOSE BAMBOOS AND DID WHAT YOU

2026
01:35:46,107 --> 01:35:46,741
DID.

2027
01:35:46,774 --> 01:35:48,843
THATS NOT MY STRENGTH, DUDE.

2028
01:35:48,876 --> 01:35:51,612
AT THE SAME TIME, IM PROUD OF
HOW I DID IN THE CHALLENGES.

2029
01:35:51,645 --> 01:35:55,616
I AM THE OLDER GUY, AND I
PARTICIPATED IN EVERY CHALLENGE

2030
01:35:55,649 --> 01:35:56,317
LIKE ALL OF THEM.

2031
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:57,651
LIKE MORE THAN ANYBODY.

2032
01:35:57,685 --> 01:35:59,887
AND I WAS NEVER THE MONKEY ON
ANYONES BACK.

2033
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:03,824
I WAS ACTUALLY LIKE STOKED ON
HOW I DID IN ALL THE CHALLENGES.

2034
01:36:03,858 --> 01:36:06,026
I WAS HAPPY.

2035
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:09,730
MIKE, THANK YOU FOR GIVING US
YOUR ANSWER, I WOULD LIKE TO

2036
01:36:09,764 --> 01:36:12,366
GIVE ANGELINA AND NICK A CHANCE
TO TELL US, HOW ARE YOU A DAVID

2037
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:15,336
AND HOW ARE YOU A GOLIATH?

2038
01:36:15,369 --> 01:36:19,774
YOU WANT THEM TO REVERSE?

2039
01:36:19,807 --> 01:36:20,407
YES.

2040
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:21,208
Jeff: ANGELINA?

2041
01:36:21,242 --> 01:36:23,110
I FELT A LOT OF THE DAVID
JOURNEY.

2042
01:36:23,144 --> 01:36:25,212
I CAME OUT HERE WITH ZERO
SURVIVAL SKILLS.

2043
01:36:25,246 --> 01:36:26,781
I DIDNT KNOW HOW THE MAKE FIRE.

2044
01:36:26,814 --> 01:36:29,350
I WAS SUPER FEARFUL OF ALL OF
THE CHALLENGES.

2045
01:36:29,383 --> 01:36:33,387
AND SO I HAD TO MUSTER UP A LOT
OF COURAGE AND TAKE THOSE

2046
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:34,221
CHANCES.

2047
01:36:34,255 --> 01:36:36,157
EVEN WITH THE ID.L. STUFF, I DUG
DEEP.

2048
01:36:36,190 --> 01:36:41,162
I WAS LIKE, I REALLY WANT TO
FIND THIS IDOL, AND I ENDED UP

2049
01:36:41,195 --> 01:36:43,998
FINDING THIS TEN-FOOT LADDER,
PUT IT AGAINST A ROCK WALL.

2050
01:36:44,031 --> 01:36:47,201
I LITERALLY CLIMBED TO THE TOP
OF THE WATERFALL.

2051
01:36:47,234 --> 01:36:49,069
I WAS STUCK UP THERE.

2052
01:36:49,103 --> 01:36:50,538
LIKE I DONT EVEN KNOW HOW HIGH.

2053
01:36:50,571 --> 01:36:53,974
SO I WENT SO HARD IN THE PAINT
FOR THE IDOL --

2054
01:36:54,008 --> 01:36:56,277
IS THAT WHAT THOSE TEARS WERE
REALLY FOR?

2055
01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:58,712
YES.

2056
01:36:58,746 --> 01:37:00,748
I DID RIP MY PANTS CLIMBING THE
ROCK WALL.

2057
01:37:00,781 --> 01:37:02,583
WOW.

2058
01:37:02,616 --> 01:37:07,288
IM LIKE, OH, MY GOD, ANGELINAS
ON A LADDER.

2059
01:37:07,321 --> 01:37:09,723
I GOT THE LADDER AND KEPT
CLIMBING.

2060
01:37:09,757 --> 01:37:11,525
100 FEET ON THE WALL.

2061
01:37:11,559 --> 01:37:12,593
I DONT KNOW.

2062
01:37:12,626 --> 01:37:14,295
IT WAS HIGH.

2063
01:37:14,328 --> 01:37:16,831
LONG STORY SHORT, I WAS SO FAR
OUT OF MY COMFORT ZONE.

2064
01:37:16,864 --> 01:37:17,965
I LEANED INTO IT.

2065
01:37:17,998 --> 01:37:21,235
GOOD FOR YOU, BECAUSE
PHYSICALLY WOMEN FIND IDOLS WAY

2066
01:37:21,268 --> 01:37:22,102
LESS OFTEN THAN MEN.

2067
01:37:22,136 --> 01:37:25,372
15% OF THEM HAVE BEEN FOUND
BY WOMEN.

2068
01:37:25,406 --> 01:37:28,776
IT WAS EXTREMELY HARD IDOL TO
FIND.

2069
01:37:28,809 --> 01:37:31,011
I HAVE ONE FOLLOW-UP
QUESTION.

2070
01:37:31,045 --> 01:37:33,480
ANGELINA, COULD YOU TALK ABOUT
MAKING A FAKE IDOL, BECAUSE IT

2071
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:35,482
FELT LIKE A PLOY TO JUST WEARS
ME.

2072
01:37:35,516 --> 01:37:37,251
ABSOLUTELY NOT TO EMBARRASS
YOU.

2073
01:37:37,284 --> 01:37:38,219
I PROMISE YOU THAT.

2074
01:37:38,252 --> 01:37:41,088
MY INTENT WAS --
 ARE YOU SHAKING YOUR HEAD?

2075
01:37:41,121 --> 01:37:42,623
YEAH, YOU WANTED TO EMBARRASS
HER.

2076
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:45,893
NEW YORK I DID NOT.

2077
01:37:45,926 --> 01:37:46,927
GO AHEAD.

2078
01:37:46,961 --> 01:37:49,630
MY INTENT WAS I DID NOT WANT YOU
TO GO AFTER MIKE.

2079
01:37:49,663 --> 01:37:52,266
THE OTHER THING IS LIKE YOU AND
I HAVE BEEN BATTLING FOR A

2080
01:37:52,299 --> 01:37:55,402
WHILE, AND I FELT LIKE IT WOULD
BE LIKE AN EPIC END TO THE

2081
01:37:55,436 --> 01:37:57,805
BATTLE, SO THERE WAS A LITTLE
BIT OF NEAT RICKS TO HAVE FUN

2082
01:37:57,838 --> 01:38:01,342
WITH THE GAME AND PLAY
AGGRESSIVELY, BUT THE MAIN POINT

2083
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:02,343
WAS TO KEEP MIKE SAFE.

2084
01:38:02,376 --> 01:38:03,978
OKAY.

2085
01:38:04,011 --> 01:38:07,514
AND I DO WANT TO GET TO NICK,
TOO.

2086
01:38:07,548 --> 01:38:12,486
HOW AM AGOLIATH?

2087
01:38:12,519 --> 01:38:14,555
FIRST, SIMPLY PUT, A GOODNIGHT,
THEY JUST ARE.

2088
01:38:14,588 --> 01:38:16,290
LIKE DAN, YOURE 63".

2089
01:38:16,323 --> 01:38:17,892
YOU JUST ARE.

2090
01:38:17,925 --> 01:38:19,894
JOHN, YOU CAN PROBABLY BREAK
THAT BOLDER IN HALF.

2091
01:38:19,927 --> 01:38:21,095
YOU JUST.

2092
01:38:21,128 --> 01:38:23,063
CAN LOOKING AT IT LIKE, THAT I
DO HAVE SOME GOLIATH QUALITIES

2093
01:38:23,097 --> 01:38:24,965
IN HOW IT RELATES TO OUTPLAY.

2094
01:38:24,999 --> 01:38:26,533
IM GOOD AT PUZZLES.

2095
01:38:26,567 --> 01:38:29,937
I DONT SIT AROUND DOING PUZZLES
ALL DAY.

2096
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:31,939
THAT LED TO TWO IMMUNITY WINS.

2097
01:38:31,972 --> 01:38:36,210
IM THE ONLY PERSON THAT WON
MORE THAN ONE IMMUNITY

2098
01:38:36,243 --> 01:38:36,911
CHALLENGE.

2099
01:38:36,944 --> 01:38:38,245
IM NATURAL PEOPLE PERSON.

2100
01:38:38,279 --> 01:38:40,281
THAT LED TO KNOWING WHERE THE
IDOLS RUSSIA WHERE THE

2101
01:38:40,314 --> 01:38:41,448
ADVANTAGES ARE.

2102
01:38:41,482 --> 01:38:44,318
I FOUND THE SECRET ADVANTAGE
BECAUSE DAVIE AND I FOUND THE

2103
01:38:44,351 --> 01:38:45,386
CLUE TOGETHER.

2104
01:38:45,419 --> 01:38:48,589
ME, CARL, AND DAVIE, WE ALL
THREE KNEW EACH OTHERS

2105
01:38:48,622 --> 01:38:49,723
ADVANTAGES.

2106
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:51,592
THATS A TESTAMENT TO MY NATURAL
ABILITY TO CONNECT WITH

2107
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:52,626
SOMEBODY.

2108
01:38:52,660 --> 01:38:54,528
AND WANT TO PLAY WITH ME AND TOO
HAVE FUN WITH ME.

2109
01:38:54,561 --> 01:38:57,298
AND THEN, OF COURSE, THE
INTELLIGENCE HELPED IN THE

2110
01:38:57,331 --> 01:38:59,133
CHALLENGES.

2111
01:38:59,166 --> 01:39:00,501
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

2112
01:39:00,534 --> 01:39:01,802
LETS MOVE ON TO THE FINAL FAST.

2113
01:39:01,835 --> 01:39:02,603
OUTLAST.

2114
01:39:02,636 --> 01:39:04,071
THIS IS WHERE IT SHIFTS BACK TO
YOU.

2115
01:39:04,104 --> 01:39:07,408
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO DESCRIBE
TO THEM YOUR JOURNEY.

2116
01:39:07,441 --> 01:39:09,143
WHAT DID YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH?

2117
01:39:09,176 --> 01:39:13,013
WHAT DID YOU HAVE TO OVERCOME TO
OUTLAST EVERYBODY TO GET HERE?

2118
01:39:13,047 --> 01:39:16,583
THIS IS YOUR PERSONAL STORY OF
WHAT THIS 39-DAY JOURNEY WAS

2119
01:39:16,617 --> 01:39:17,451
LIKE FOR YOU.

2120
01:39:17,484 --> 01:39:17,885
ANGELINA?

2121
01:39:17,918 --> 01:39:19,153
GET US STARTED.

2122
01:39:19,186 --> 01:39:22,556
SO LOOKING BACK ON DAY ONE ON
THE BARGE, I STARTED TO REALIZE

2123
01:39:22,589 --> 01:39:24,058
WHY I WAS A GOODNIGHT.

2124
01:39:24,091 --> 01:39:27,795
A LOT OF MY LIFE EVERYTHING THAT
IVE SET MY MIND TO I HAVE BEEN

2125
01:39:27,828 --> 01:39:28,929
ABLE TO DO.

2126
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:32,066
AS A MILITARY WIFE, I THINK
WERE SOME OF THE STRONGEST

2127
01:39:32,099 --> 01:39:33,233
PEOPLE OUT THERE.

2128
01:39:33,267 --> 01:39:35,669
WE GO THROUGH A LOT IN OUR
PERSONAL HIERVETION I WAS LIKE,

2129
01:39:35,703 --> 01:39:39,373
IF I CAN GO THROUGH DEPLOYMENTS
MAYBE THAT WILL TRANSFER TO THE

2130
01:39:39,406 --> 01:39:40,574
GAME.

2131
01:39:40,607 --> 01:39:43,010
IT WAS OUT HERE THAT FOR THE
FIRST TIME I REALLY FELT LIKE I

2132
01:39:43,043 --> 01:39:44,545
HIT A ROCK BOTTOM.

2133
01:39:44,578 --> 01:39:49,183
I REALLY FELT LIKE BEATEN DOWN
AND VULNERABLE AND OUT OF

2134
01:39:49,216 --> 01:39:52,920
CONTROL IN SOME WAYS, KIND OF,
YOU KNOW, DAMAGED GOODS AS

2135
01:39:52,953 --> 01:39:54,154
PEOPLE SAID.

2136
01:39:54,188 --> 01:39:58,192
BUT I WAS ABLE TO RISE AND PICK
MYSELF UP FROM THAT SITUATION

2137
01:39:58,225 --> 01:40:01,996
AND BUILD RELATIONSHIPS AND FIND
A PATH FORWARD.

2138
01:40:02,029 --> 01:40:05,432
AND GET BACK INTO A POSITION OF
STRENGTH.

2139
01:40:05,466 --> 01:40:09,737
SO I FEEL LIKE I AM THE MOST
BATTLE-TESTED PLAYER SITTING IN

2140
01:40:09,770 --> 01:40:10,738
FRONT OF YOU.

2141
01:40:10,771 --> 01:40:13,040
THE STORY OF DAVID AND GOLIATH
IS ABOUT TRIUMPH.

2142
01:40:13,073 --> 01:40:17,811
I FEEL LIKE MY STORY OUT HERE
WAS ABOUT TRIUMPH.

2143
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:19,179
Jeff: NICK?

2144
01:40:19,213 --> 01:40:20,414
OKAY.

2145
01:40:20,447 --> 01:40:22,783
SO I WENT THROUGH TONGS OF UPS
AND DOWNS IN THIS GAME, WHETHER

2146
01:40:22,816 --> 01:40:26,553
IT BE GETTING SWAPPED TO A TRIBE
WITH THREE GOLIATHS OR TWO

2147
01:40:26,587 --> 01:40:29,490
DAVID, WORKING MY BUTT OFF TO
FINALLY GET THE DAVID ALLIANCE

2148
01:40:29,523 --> 01:40:32,960
AN ADVANTAGE, AND THEN NEXT
THING I KNOW IM THE ONLY DAVID

2149
01:40:32,993 --> 01:40:33,627
LEFT.

2150
01:40:33,660 --> 01:40:35,195
IM NOT JUST FACING GOLIATHS.

2151
01:40:35,229 --> 01:40:41,101
I FEEL LIKE IM UP AGAINST THE
WHOLE PHILISTINE ARMY WHEN ITS

2152
01:40:41,135 --> 01:40:42,503
FOUR GOLIATHS AND ONE DAVID.

2153
01:40:42,536 --> 01:40:44,071
ITS WHAT IVE ALWAYS KNOWN.

2154
01:40:44,104 --> 01:40:47,007
FIGHTING MY WAY OUT OF THESE
STRUGGLES, HOW IVE DONE MY

2155
01:40:47,041 --> 01:40:48,275
WHOLE LIFE.

2156
01:40:48,308 --> 01:40:51,512
I MEAN, MY MOM PASSED AWAY FROM
A DRUG OVERDOSE, SO THATS WHY I

2157
01:40:51,545 --> 01:40:52,846
DO WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING.

2158
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:55,783
I HELP PEOPLE WHO STRUGGLE WITH
DRUG ADDICTION INSTEAD OF THEM

2159
01:40:55,816 --> 01:40:58,185
GOING TO PRISON, I TRY TO GET
THEM TO GO TO REHAB.

2160
01:40:58,218 --> 01:41:01,321
YOU KNOW, BASICALLY JUST LET
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND LIKE, IF THERE

2161
01:41:01,355 --> 01:41:04,591
IS A BREATH LEFT IN YOUR BODY,
LIFE IS WORTH LIVING.

2162
01:41:04,625 --> 01:41:07,895
AND IF YOURE IN THIS GAME, IF
YOU HAVE ANY SPOT LEFT IN YOU,

2163
01:41:07,928 --> 01:41:11,398
IF YOU HAVE A LEFT IN YOUR BODY,
THIS GAME IS WORTH PLAYING.

2164
01:41:11,432 --> 01:41:12,533
YOURE NEVER OUT OF IT.

2165
01:41:12,566 --> 01:41:16,336
I WAS A DAVID THE ENTIRE GAME,
AND I HAD TO FIND WHATEVER

2166
01:41:16,370 --> 01:41:19,740
SLINGSHOT I COULD, WHETHER IT BE
THE SOCIAL GAME, THE STRATEGY

2167
01:41:19,773 --> 01:41:23,844
GAME, THE IMMUNITY WIN, AN
ADVANTAGE, AN IDOL, NEW

2168
01:41:23,877 --> 01:41:26,847
RELATIONSHIP, OLD RELATIONSHIP,
WHATEVER IT TOOK, I HAD TO FIND

2169
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:30,184
MY SLINGSHOT AND I HAD TO FIND
AS MANY STONES AS I COULD FIND,

2170
01:41:30,217 --> 01:41:35,289
BECAUSE I THINK I WAS THE
UNDERDOG MOST OF THIS GAME.

2171
01:41:35,322 --> 01:41:37,091
NO.

2172
01:41:37,124 --> 01:41:38,192
Jeff: MIKE.

2173
01:41:38,225 --> 01:41:40,961
AS FAR AS MY GAME, I DONT
KNOW.

2174
01:41:40,994 --> 01:41:44,298
I NEVER REALLY FELT TOO NERVOUS.

2175
01:41:44,331 --> 01:41:46,033
I WANTED TO PLAY A GOOD GAME.

2176
01:41:46,066 --> 01:41:49,603
IT WASNT LIKE I JUST WANTED TO
GET TO THE END AS LIKE A GOAT OR

2177
01:41:49,636 --> 01:41:50,871
AS LIKE SOMEBODY WHO WASNT
PLAYING.

2178
01:41:50,904 --> 01:41:52,172
I WANTED TO PLAY.

2179
01:41:52,206 --> 01:41:54,374
AND I FEEL LIKE I DID PLAY.

2180
01:41:54,408 --> 01:41:59,746
FOR ME, MY PERSONAL STRUGGLE WAS
LIKE, WHAT AM I -- WHAT DO I

2181
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:00,380
STAND FOR.

2182
01:42:00,414 --> 01:42:01,448
WHAT AM I PLAYING FOR?

2183
01:42:01,482 --> 01:42:03,083
WHAT DO I STAND FOR?

2184
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:06,520
AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
COMING ON HERE MEANS TO ME TO

2185
01:42:06,553 --> 01:42:11,725
TRY TO FEEL LIKE THERE WAS
SOMETHING WORTHY IN MY BATTLE TO

2186
01:42:11,758 --> 01:42:12,960
WIN.

2187
01:42:12,993 --> 01:42:15,762
YOU KNOW, LIKE THEY SAY, EVERY
RAINBOW HAS A POT OF GOLD AT THE

2188
01:42:15,796 --> 01:42:19,199
END, AND ITS LIKE, FOR ME, IT
WAS NEVER ABOUT THE POT OF GOLD.

2189
01:42:19,233 --> 01:42:21,535
ITS ABOUT THE RAINBOW.

2190
01:42:21,568 --> 01:42:27,074
AND IT SO SPEAKS TO WHAT I
VALUE, WHICH IS TAKING A RISK,

2191
01:42:27,107 --> 01:42:29,143
EMBARRASSING YOURSELF, HAVING AN
ADVENTURE.

2192
01:42:29,176 --> 01:42:31,211
IM NOT ACTING LIKE IM A SAINT.

2193
01:42:31,245 --> 01:42:35,082
IM NOT SAINT, BUT LIKE IT WAS
MORE ABOUT THE STRUGGLE FOR ME

2194
01:42:35,115 --> 01:42:39,386
TO FEEL LIKE THIS WAS A WORTHY
ENDEAVOR FOR ME TO WIN THIS

2195
01:42:39,419 --> 01:42:42,422
GAME.

2196
01:42:42,456 --> 01:42:46,560
I JUST WANT TO TELL ALL THREE
OF YALL CONGRATULATIONS.

2197
01:42:46,593 --> 01:42:49,863
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

2198
01:42:49,897 --> 01:42:51,398
[APPLAUSE]
 Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

2199
01:42:51,431 --> 01:42:53,433
EVERY ADVENTURE HAS TO COME TO
AN END.

2200
01:42:53,467 --> 01:42:55,903
THERES BEEN A LOT OF
INFORMATION DISCUSSED TONIGHT.

2201
01:42:55,936 --> 01:42:58,472
IM GOING TO GIVE YOU GUYS A
MOMENT THE TAKE IT ALL IN.

2202
01:42:58,505 --> 01:43:01,742
THEN WE WILL VOTE FOR A WINNER
OF "SURVIVOR: DAVID VS.

2203
01:43:01,775 --> 01:43:05,746
