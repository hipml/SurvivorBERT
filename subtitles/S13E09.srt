>> JEFF PROBST: previously on

2
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:03,420
<i>Survivor...</i>

3
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:04,379
>> I'd rather be on the same

4
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:05,338
page and know what's going on.

5
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:06,381
>> PROBST: Aitu was uneasy with

6
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:07,674
their kidnapped Raro member in

7
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:08,717
camp.

8
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,300
>> He's going crazy right now.

9
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,260
>> The thing I don't like is

10
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,177
that that whole conversation

11
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,262
happened right in front of Nate.

12
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,179
>> PROBST: At the reward

13
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,181
challenge...

14
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,641
Rebecca quickly falling behind.

15
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,810
...Aitu forced Nate to sit out.

16
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:19,853
>> Brad, why aren't you

17
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:20,770
swimming?

18
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:21,730
>> Because I'm better at

19
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:22,564
puzzles.

20
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:23,440
>> PROBST: Nate watched

21
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,441
helplessly as his Raro tribe

22
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,275
fell behind and never recovered.

23
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:31,030
Aitu wins reward!

24
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,323
When Nate returned to Raro...

25
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,450
>> He knows he's one of our best

26
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:34,534
swimmers.

27
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:35,535
>> PROBST: ...the tribe

28
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:36,494
questioned Brad's decision not

29
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,537
to swim.

30
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,496
>> We're always choking at

31
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,289
the...

32
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:39,789
>> We need you swimming,

33
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,957
brother.

34
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,791
>> The thing is, I'm creative

35
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:42,542
spatial.

36
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,334
I do puzzles.

37
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:43,793
>> Brad pissed me off.

38
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:44,919
"I'm good at puzzles."

39
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:45,795
I don't care about that

40
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:46,588
nonsense.

41
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:47,505
>> PROBST: At Aitu...

42
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,465
>> I caught a bird.

43
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,466
>> PROBST: ...Ozzy's role as

44
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,592
provider was a mixed blessing.

45
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:51,843
>> Good job, Oz.

46
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:52,886
I underestimated him.

47
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:53,470
We should get rid of him while

48
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,513
we still have the control rather

49
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,681
than wait for a merge and

50
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:57,974
potentially have him dominate

51
00:00:58,057 --> 00:00:59,017
some of the individual

52
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,059
challenges.

53
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,519
>> PROBST: Go, Nate!

54
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,187
At the immunity challenge, Raro

55
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:06,024
made a comeback.

56
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,776
Raro wins immunity!

57
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,903
Aitu, tribal council tonight,

58
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,154
one of you going home.

59
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,655
See you at tribal.

60
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,824
>> That's the decision.

61
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:15,325
>> PROBST: Back at Aitu,

62
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,951
Jonathan targeted Flicka.

63
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:17,535
>> Maybe the choice is Flicka.

64
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,078
I'm trying to stay one step

65
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:24,125
ahead of the competition.

66
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,126
>> PROBST: While Flicka tried to

67
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,045
target Jonathan.

68
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,591
>> PROBST: But her scrambling

69
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:32,759
pestered some of the girls.

70
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:33,384
>> She was like a mosquito that

71
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,637
won't die.

72
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:38,681
>> PROBST: And Ozzy, who was

73
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,682
concerned about his own

74
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,642
vulnerability, agreed that

75
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,727
Jonathan was a threat.

76
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,940
>> Jonathan seems to inspire

77
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:47,524
some level of mistrust among

78
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,317
pretty much everybody.

79
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,527
I haven't seen it, but because

80
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,986
everyone else was suspicious of

81
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,112
him, I mean, it can't help but

82
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,280
rub off on me a little bit.

83
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,324
>> PROBST: In the end...

84
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:57,867
Eighth person voted out of

85
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,285
the Cook Islands...

86
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,703
...Flicka's scrambling became

87
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:01,704
her downfall, and she was voted

88
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,705
out.

89
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,542
Jessica, the tribe has spoken.

90
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,001
12 are left.

91
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,212
Who will be voted out tonight?

92
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:10,588
Captioning sponsored by

93
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:11,339
CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK

94
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:16,177
TELEVISION

95
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,353
>> Listen, we're in a good

96
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,397
place, right?

97
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,231
We've really done well, the five

98
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:28,398
of us.

99
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,108
>> We need to stay tight.

100
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:30,942
>> And we'll continue to stay

101
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:31,818
tight.

102
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:32,443
We know what the next move is if

103
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:35,572
we have an elimination, right?

104
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,490
The most solid thing is if we go

105
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,033
in with six, and they have four,

106
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:39,617
and we keep Ozzy around for at

107
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,744
least one vote, vote somebody

108
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,413
off, then vote Ozzy off, and the

109
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,039
five of us can,, you know, go to

110
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:45,373
town.

111
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,959
People are a little antsy as

112
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:48,585
we're approaching what we think

113
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,128
is a merge in the next couple

114
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,171
of days.

115
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:52,672
We have five strong now.

116
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:56,134
I assume if there's one more

117
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,218
immunity challenge and we lose

118
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:01,514
it, we will let go of Ozzy.

119
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,390
But I don't care how tight you

120
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:04,309
think your fivesome is, things

121
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,311
are going to change.

122
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,270
>> You know, anything can happen

123
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:16,946
at this point.

124
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,865
>> I don't want to keep this six

125
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,491
through the merge.

126
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,911
I want to get back together with

127
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,871
Adam and Parvati.

128
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:25,997
So I'm just ready for some

129
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,915
movement, get some other people

130
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,124
out of here.

131
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,083
I'm nervous because it's kind of

132
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:29,959
like the calm before the storm,

133
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,127
you know.

134
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,003
I think stuff's about to start

135
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,546
moving.

136
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:01,467
>> As much as everybody's

137
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,678
saying, "Let's stay together

138
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,429
with the six," it's going to get

139
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,431
to a point where somebody's

140
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,807
going to get greedy, you know

141
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,100
what I mean?

142
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:09,684
And it's going to get ugly.

143
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,477
And I don't, you know....

144
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,520
>> I don't want them to do it to

145
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,439
me.

146
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:14,731
>> Right.

147
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,441
I don't want to be the one left

148
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,483
out to dry.

149
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,526
>> You and I are tight.

150
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:19,777
We're going to make this work.

151
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,195
Set something up with Parvati.

152
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,447
Let's hope we can do that.

153
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,198
Maybe it'll be us four

154
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,658
Caucasians in the final four--

155
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,660
me, you, Adam, Parvati-- and at

156
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:28,494
that point, we have the numbers.

157
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:32,623
And I just think we have to be

158
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,209
the ones to make that flop

159
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,586
before they do.

160
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,587
I am determined to not be the

161
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,422
guy who made the move too late,

162
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,424
you know?

163
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,593
I've trusted you all along, you

164
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,511
trusted me.

165
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,139
And it's gotten us a long way,

166
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:48,765
and it's going to get us a long

167
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,725
way further.

168
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:51,559
Candice and I talked a lot about

169
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,437
the fact that eventually we were

170
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,813
going to have to do some kind of

171
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,023
flop.

172
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:57,607
She's the one person that I'm

173
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,817
the tightest with.

174
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,027
Only two people can sit at the

175
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,196
final two, and I want it to be

176
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,864
you and me, I swear to God.

177
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,033
>> Jonathan's got this new plan,

178
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,493
but I'm not sure that Jonathan

179
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,244
has really any allegiance.

180
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,704
I think he'll do whatever he

181
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,457
needs to get by, so I'd like to

182
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,793
see Jonathan go.

183
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,591
>> Do you think we could merge

184
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:24,550
now?

185
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,552
>> We're going to merge soon.

186
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,107
>> Did you just hear that

187
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,691
comment about, "It's everyone

188
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:44,821
for themselves"?

189
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,656
>> I have to play Brad right

190
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:47,949
now.

191
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,659
He has done questionable things,

192
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,535
you know?

193
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,079
He's Slim Shady right now,

194
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,330
straight-up.

195
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:54,914
>> That infuriates me that he

196
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:55,498
said that.

197
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,499
It's not an individual game yet.

198
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:01,295
>> We have to play for our team.

199
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,214
>> No.

200
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,636
>> I lost my trust with him, and

201
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:09,637
it sucks, because I like the guy

202
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,139
a lot.

203
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,306
There's still team.

204
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,307
There's no "I" in that team

205
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:13,683
right now for him.

206
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:14,684
And so I'll make him think,

207
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,561
"Yeah, dog, I got your back,

208
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:16,769
homey.

209
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,729
Yeah, we tight."

210
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,815
Sucker.

211
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,777
>> PROBST: Raro, come on in.

212
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,245
Aitu, come on in.

213
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,580
Raro getting your first look at

214
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,081
the new Aitu tribe.

215
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,207
Jessica voted out at the last

216
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,750
tribal council.

217
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,134
Okay, before we get to today's

218
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,886
reward challenge, we're going to

219
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,096
do something a little different.

220
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,517
I'm offering each of you the

221
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:00,897
opportunity to mutiny and join

222
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,066
the other tribe.

223
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,193
>> Man!

224
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,694
>> Oh, my god!

225
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,408
>> PROBST: You have ten seconds

226
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:12,950
to decide whether or not you

227
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,785
want to change things up and

228
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:15,995
maybe change your fate in this

229
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,788
game.

230
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,207
If you want to move, step off

231
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,208
your mat and join the other

232
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,542
tribe.

233
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,629
The clock is ticking.

234
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:35,973
Five, four, three, two.

235
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,767
Candice is mutinying.

236
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,519
One.

237
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,438
Jonathan mutinies at the last

238
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:42,688
second.

239
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,649
That is it.

240
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,526
Jonathan, Candice, you're Aitu

241
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,819
no more.

242
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:49,612
Join Rarotonga.

243
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,530
>> Hi.

244
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,115
>> Hi.

245
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,159
>> Welcome back.

246
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:55,785
>> PROBST: Candice you're now a

247
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,120
member of Raro, Jonathan, a

248
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,749
member of Raro.

249
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:06,545
So, Aitu, you just had two

250
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,256
members of your tribe mutiny.

251
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,882
Yul, you don't look happy.

252
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,300
>> No, I'm stunned.

253
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,510
I thought we had a pretty good

254
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:13,010
game plan, and I'm very

255
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,637
surprised.

256
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,680
>> PROBST: Ozzy, what's your

257
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:16,722
reaction?

258
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:17,807
>> It doesn't really surprise

259
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,766
me.

260
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:19,600
They don't have the backbone to

261
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,227
stick with their tribe, then

262
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,562
that's fine.

263
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,145
I'm sure that they're going to

264
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,856
get their fate sooner or later.

265
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,275
>> PROBST: Okay, everybody ready

266
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,276
to get to today's reward

267
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,902
challenge?

268
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,988
Two of you from each tribe will

269
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,407
start inside a barrel.

270
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,616
On my "go," the rest of the

271
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,201
tribe will push you through a

272
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,703
series of obstacles.

273
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,246
Along the way, you'll collect a

274
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,164
total of four buoys which you'll

275
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,542
then use to float the two people

276
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,878
in the barrel across the lagoon.

277
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,463
When you reach the center of the

278
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,881
lagoon, dive down and retrieve

279
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,633
four flags.

280
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,635
When you reach the other side of

281
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,138
the lagoon, you'll take those

282
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,931
four flags and attach them to a

283
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,474
flagpole.

284
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,684
The entire tribe will then dig

285
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,061
down, uncover an ax, use that ax

286
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,980
to chop a rope which will raise

287
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:06,689
your flags.

288
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,233
The first tribe to raise their

289
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,985
flags wins reward.

290
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:11,986
Want to know what you're playing

291
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:12,862
for?

292
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:13,946
>> Yeah.

293
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,947
>> PROBST: The winning tribe

294
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:15,990
will go to a nice, relaxing

295
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:16,991
environment.

296
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,076
You'll have coffee, some

297
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,870
muffins.

298
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:21,954
>> Oh!

299
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,122
>> PROBST: Danishes.

300
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,290
>> Oh, my god!

301
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,207
>> PROBST: And because it's

302
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,292
always nice to have something to

303
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,335
read with your morning cup of

304
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,502
coffee, you will have letters

305
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,713
from home written by your loved

306
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,881
ones for you.

307
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,758
Worth playing for?

308
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:34,884
>> Yeah.

309
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,010
>> PROBST: This is going to be

310
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:36,719
two women and two men from each

311
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:37,845
tribe.

312
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:38,804
I'll give you a minute to

313
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,808
strategize.

314
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,810
In the barrel for Aitu, it is

315
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,896
Becky and Sundra.

316
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,439
For Raro, Jenny and Candice.

317
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,274
Here we go.

318
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,860
Survivors ready?

319
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:56,113
Go!

320
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,157
Both barrels heading down, a

321
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,869
quick ride into the sand.

322
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:05,998
Ozzy gets the buoys for Aitu!

323
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,583
Adam and Nate get the buoys for

324
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,793
Raro!

325
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,127
Ozzy back first.

326
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,337
Yul and Ozzy putting the buoys

327
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,838
in the barrel.

328
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,215
Nate and Adam back with their

329
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,217
buoys loading in the barrel.

330
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,635
Aitu off and running.

331
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,304
Raro right behind.

332
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:20,930
Aitu with the lead as they get

333
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,224
to the log roll.

334
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:23,891
You've got to roll them over

335
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:24,809
these logs.

336
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:25,810
Not going to be a comfortable

337
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:29,188
ride.

338
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,495
>> PROBST: Aitu still with a bit

339
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:44,870
of a lead.

340
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,081
Nate and Adam right behind.

341
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,416
Once you hit your mat, you can

342
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,334
get your next two buoys.

343
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:50,835
Aitu on the mat!

344
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,878
Raro's on the mat.

345
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:56,132
Ozzy back with the buoys for

346
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,842
Aitu.

347
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,385
Nate and Adam back with the

348
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,594
buoys for Raro.

349
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,388
Two new tribes battling it out.

350
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:02,888
Who made the right move?

351
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,474
Who made the wrong move?

352
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,393
Candace and Jenny suffocating

353
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:12,731
with all the buoys inside.

354
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,817
Got to get those buoys clipped

355
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,277
to the barrels so you can float

356
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,989
across the lagoon.

357
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:23,909
Ozzy and Yul in the water.

358
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,036
Raro still struggling.

359
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,329
They've got to get in deeper

360
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:27,913
water.

361
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,874
Aitu is now floating their

362
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,959
barrel.

363
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,961
Raro now in the deep enough

364
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:34,962
water.

365
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,088
They can start floating, but

366
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,506
Aitu has a big lead at this

367
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,799
point.

368
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:44,096
Aitu has reached their flag.

369
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,397
Ozzy's got the first flag.

370
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,483
Raro cannot get there.

371
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,239
Ozzy up with the second flag.

372
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,075
Raro is floating away.

373
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:09,955
Ozzy comes up with his final two

374
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:10,956
flags.

375
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,000
He's got all four.

376
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,920
Raro cannot fight the current.

377
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,631
Let's go!

378
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:24,428
Raro, no chance of getting back.

379
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,014
Aitu now on the other side.

380
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:27,848
Ozzy and Yul have been

381
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,017
workhorses on this challenge.

382
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,144
>> Get out, get out!

383
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,812
>> PROBST: big reward on the

384
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:34,021
line.

385
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,941
Somebody going to Exile Island.

386
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,318
Becky's going to hang the flags.

387
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:43,531
>> Come on!

388
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,824
>> PROBST: Aitu has their four

389
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:46,700
flags.

390
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:50,829
Now they've got to find the ax.

391
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,790
They've found the ax.

392
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:55,876
Aitu wins reward!

393
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,545
>> Yes!

394
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,963
>> Yeah!

395
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,431
>> Yeah!

396
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,642
Yeah!

397
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,856
>> PROBST: Well, it would be an

398
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,482
understatement to say that this

399
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,401
game has just taken a dramatic

400
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:20,985
turn.

401
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,279
Aitu, as winners, you are

402
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,071
sending somebody from the Raro

403
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,740
tribe to Exile Island.

404
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:27,825
>> Hmm...

405
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:28,784
>> PROBST: who's it going to be?

406
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:29,118
>> Candice.

407
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:29,994
>> PROBST: Candice, big signal

408
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:30,995
coming from your old tribe.

409
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,998
Let's go, Candice.

410
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,170
Raro, got nothing for you.

411
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,380
Grab your stuff.

412
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,923
Head on back to camp.

413
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,092
Sundra, you're crying.

414
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,135
>> Because, you know, I wanted

415
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,928
to stay true to my guys, and we

416
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,139
worked well together.

417
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,099
Feels good.

418
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,309
>> PROBST: Well, in this case,

419
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,310
it certainly paid off to stick

420
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,352
together.

421
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:55,978
You have a big reward-- coffee,

422
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,147
tasty assortment of pastries,

423
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,232
love letters from home just

424
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,358
behind you.

425
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,444
Grab your stuff.

426
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,779
Head on over.

427
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,376
>> Whoo!

428
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,753
>> Yeah!

429
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:26,967
>> Oh, my god!

430
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,429
>> I love you guys!

431
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,732
>> Yeah, I can't believe it.

432
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,317
I can't believe it.

433
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:46,403
>> Me, too.

434
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,071
I don't know when I've felt like

435
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,031
this.

436
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,115
When I saw the mutiny in its

437
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:50,991
completion, the numbers were

438
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,201
scary.

439
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,203
Standing there and you're

440
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,537
feeling so small and pitiful and

441
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,581
you look over to the Raro side,

442
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,207
and they look so big and

443
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,417
triumphant.

444
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,169
And when we won the challenge, I

445
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,003
cried.

446
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,798
I straight up cried.

447
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,050
I don't think I've ever been as

448
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,844
happy in my life.

449
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:11,929
>> All right, let's have a

450
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:12,971
toast, guys.

451
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,764
>> To Aitu.

452
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:14,556
>> To Aitu.

453
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,349
>> To Aitu.

454
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,308
>> Working together, keeping

455
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,476
calm, cool, collected.

456
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,394
>> This will take us to the end,

457
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,269
guys.

458
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,187
>> Cheers.

459
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,064
>> Oh, the reward was beautiful.

460
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,191
We had these dry robes that we

461
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,484
could put on.

462
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,568
And then laid out before us was

463
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,528
every kind of pastry you can

464
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:28,487
think of.

465
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,405
It was like a recharge, you

466
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,364
know?

467
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,281
I feel, like, brand new.

468
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,157
I feel like I'm ready to do

469
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,326
anything.

470
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,079
>> Oh, my god!

471
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,247
>> Who is it?

472
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,249
>> Oh, my god!

473
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,333
>> That's you?

474
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,377
Oh, you were so cute!

475
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,086
>> Oh, sexy Becky.

476
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,171
I love it.

477
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,215
>> That's my son.

478
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,174
>> Oh, my god, he's adorable.

479
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,300
>> Okay, I like this one.

480
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,053
>> All right...

481
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,180
>> No, we're seeing these.

482
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,932
>> I'm feeling really good about

483
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:57,933
my tribe.

484
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:58,434
When you see each other's

485
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,561
families and see pictures of

486
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:01,729
each other growing up, I mean,

487
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:02,855
it just really hits you that

488
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:03,939
these are real people that

489
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:04,481
you're interacting with, you

490
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,066
know-- people that with hopes,

491
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,736
dreams, fears, aspirations.

492
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,336
>> I haven't seen my son in

493
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,005
three weeks, and in the letter,

494
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:28,589
he was like, "I hope you're

495
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,299
fine."

496
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,800
And he said that he was really

497
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,344
concerned that I'm not alone.

498
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,305
I have a great little boy, and

499
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,307
I'm realizing, "What the hell am

500
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,183
I doing here?"

501
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,268
But I always teach my son

502
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,020
"Winners never quit, and

503
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:43,645
quitters never win," so I can't

504
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,355
teach him that and come out here

505
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,566
and quit.

506
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:58,869
>> That's Ozzy.

507
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,287
>> Ozzy needs a hug.

508
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,665
>> Aww...

509
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,346
>> We are stronger than we've

510
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,347
ever been.

511
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,139
The mutiny solidified our

512
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,183
commitment and dedication to

513
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,726
each other.

514
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,394
I mean, we're a team to the end

515
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,355
now.

516
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:32,861
>> Oh, there's nothing in here.

517
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,114
I've been waiting the whole time

518
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,156
to get back with my friends Adam

519
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,826
and Parvati.

520
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,369
So I made the decision to

521
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,120
mutiny.

522
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,622
You know, it's four people on

523
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:44,248
the old Aitu tribe that are

524
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,834
really mad at me right now.

525
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:47,459
Obviously they're going to have

526
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,337
it out for me.

527
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,547
I was surprised that Jonathan

528
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,382
stepped out right behind me.

529
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,342
He's been saying that we were

530
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,426
really, really close, and we've

531
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,469
been tight the whole time, but I

532
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,929
haven't really trusted Jonathan

533
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,265
to begin with.

534
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,725
Now I'm here, sitting on Exile

535
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,853
Island by myself, while Jonathan

536
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:06,478
is bonding, having a good time,

537
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,982
and I'm out of the game.

538
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,448
>> Wow, here I am.

539
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,199
>> You're back.

540
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,367
>> I took a step into the

541
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,326
unknown, guys.

542
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,369
I wanted to be here and meet

543
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,204
some of you folks.

544
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,455
So were you guys totally

545
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,540
shocked...

546
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:27,249
>> I was.

547
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,250
>> ...at Candice and I wanting

548
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,127
to come over here?

549
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:30,919
>> No.

550
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:31,628
>> No?

551
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:32,421
Good.

552
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,297
>> What?

553
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:33,922
>> I mean, it's a crazy thing to

554
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,215
do.

555
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,383
And Candice and I are the last

556
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,343
two in here.

557
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,303
I don't know how tight you guys

558
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,305
are, but it seemed like the

559
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,681
right thing to do, you know.

560
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,057
If I've made a mistake it was in

561
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:44,641
trusting Candice too much, and

562
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,560
she made an impulsive move and I

563
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:47,311
followed her.

564
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:50,105
So I'm in the danger seat now.

565
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:51,231
I'm the eighth man in.

566
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,357
I consider myself a loyal

567
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,235
person, and Candice and I have

568
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,320
been together through the whole

569
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,363
thing.

570
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,323
You know, I saw her do it and I

571
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,699
said, "Okay, let's go."

572
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,826
My game plan is to earn their

573
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,994
trust, and the only way I can do

574
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:04,536
that right now is by being

575
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,955
totally non-threatening and

576
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,124
anxious to help.

577
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:10,167
And listen, I hope it doesn't

578
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,168
bite me in the butt, but...

579
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,127
>> Welcome.

580
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:12,461
>> Thank you.

581
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,337
>> I knew Candice was going to

582
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,464
come over, but my man Jonathan

583
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,341
rolled over too with her.

584
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,176
You must be smoking some good

585
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,427
stuff if you think you're going

586
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,511
to roll up into our crib and

587
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,721
just start stirring waters, you

588
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:23,263
know?

589
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,307
Brad is going to be safe for a

590
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,433
vote if it has to come to that,

591
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,434
you know?

592
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,518
Because he at least stood with

593
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,937
us and said, "I'm not budging."

594
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,355
So the first one, definitely, is

595
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,814
Jonathan.

596
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:33,815
There was no question about

597
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:34,858
that.

598
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:35,859
To really think we all have your

599
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,069
back after we just saw you sell

600
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:37,527
out your other tribe?

601
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,614
Are you dumb?

602
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,482
>> You're good around camp.

603
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,693
You're a workhorse.

604
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:18,944
>> I'm out here to do this, you

605
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:19,945
know?

606
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:20,570
We could get voted off tomorrow.

607
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,197
I don't know what's going to

608
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,240
happen.

609
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,157
>> Yeah.

610
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,075
>> You know what I mean?

611
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,451
Sometimes opportunity knocks,

612
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,744
you've got to just walk through

613
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,037
the door and hope for the best.

614
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,164
So for me and Candice, the risky

615
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,250
time is the next two votes.

616
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,251
>> I know.

617
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,168
>> Listen, I don't know what's

618
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,211
going on over here.

619
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:37,295
>> Yeah.

620
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:37,879
>> Just so you know, she and I

621
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,590
wanted to come back and deal

622
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,550
with you and Parvati.

623
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,342
>> Yeah, I know.

624
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:42,968
I understand that, I understand

625
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,219
that.

626
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:45,220
>> You know what I mean?

627
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:46,138
>> That's cool with me.

628
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,014
I'll do that.

629
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:47,889
Because we're the original

630
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:48,932
tribe, man.

631
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:49,558
Jonathan really wants myself,

632
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,394
him, Candice, and Parvati to be

633
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,938
the final four.

634
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:55,564
You know, just to have someone

635
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,482
there that wants that and wants

636
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,569
to include me is good to have

637
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,612
along the ride.

638
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,794
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

639
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:23,633
We'll now bring in Candice,

640
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:26,970
returning from Exile Island.

641
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:34,644
>> Hey, guys.

642
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:37,647
>> Hey!

643
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:43,612
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

644
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:44,404
to today's challenge?

645
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:44,613
>> Yeah.

646
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,114
>> Yeah.

647
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:46,823
>> PROBST: All right, first

648
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:47,616
things first.

649
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,410
Let's take back immunity.

650
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,789
Once again, immunity is back up

651
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:54,873
for grabs.

652
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,083
For today's challenge, you will

653
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,919
paddle out in glass-bottom boats

654
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,129
searching for three underwater

655
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,298
targets.

656
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,384
When you line up the crosshairs

657
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,968
on your target with the

658
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,386
crosshairs on your boat, you'll

659
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,596
release a cannonball, which will

660
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,765
drop from the boat, hitting a

661
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,350
target, releasing a pair of

662
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:13,600
buoys.

663
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,644
When you have all the buoys back

664
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,063
to shore, use the buoys to solve

665
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,898
a word puzzle.

666
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,525
One buoy provides a clue.

667
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,485
The rest of the buoys will form

668
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,611
the one-word answer.

669
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:25,654
First tribe to solve it

670
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,572
correctly wins immunity,

671
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,866
guaranteed a one in 11 shot at a

672
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,659
million bucks.

673
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,619
Losers go to tribal council

674
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,829
tonight.

675
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,372
Somebody will be voted out.

676
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:35,664
Make sense?

677
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:36,456
>> Yes.

678
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,541
>> PROBST: Raro, you have four

679
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,376
extra members.

680
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,293
You cannot sit out the same

681
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,378
people in back-to-back

682
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,337
challenges, so your decision is

683
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,547
made.

684
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,631
The people who participated

685
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:45,882
yesterday will sit out today.

686
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:46,842
Take your spots, we'll get

687
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,844
started.

688
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,554
All right, for Raro it's

689
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:51,680
Parvati, Jonathan, Rebecca, and

690
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,933
Brad taking on Becky, Ozzy, Yul,

691
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,726
and Sundra for Aitu.

692
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,477
Here we go, for immunity.

693
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,772
Survivors ready?

694
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,442
Go!

695
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,486
You're looking for three targets

696
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,197
releasing three pairs of buoys.

697
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,199
Both tribes pushing their boats

698
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:15,328
as far as they can.

699
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,830
>> Get in, Yul.

700
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:17,914
>> PROBST: Aitu first to start

701
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:18,874
paddling.

702
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:19,958
Raro is paddling.

703
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,419
Raro immediately off the course.

704
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,045
>> Turn, turn, left.

705
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:24,671
>> I see the first one over

706
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,590
here.

707
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:27,716
I see the first one over here.

708
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,884
>> Okay.

709
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:29,759
>> All right, slow down, slow

710
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,635
down.

711
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:30,886
>> Okay.

712
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:31,553
>> Backpedal, backpedal.

713
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,512
>> PROBST: Aitu trying to line

714
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,306
up their first target.

715
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,098
>> Okay, tell me whenever you're

716
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:35,932
ready.

717
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:36,683
One, two... drop it.

718
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:39,728
Do it!

719
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,813
>> PROBST: Aitu releases a

720
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:42,981
cannonball.

721
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:43,899
>> We were right on it.

722
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,275
>> PROBST: Just off.

723
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,276
>> Over here, straight!

724
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:46,902
>> PROBST: Both tribes searching

725
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:51,823
for that first set of buoys.

726
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,492
Raro very close to their buoys.

727
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:54,910
>> You guys ready?

728
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,204
>> PROBST: Brad and Parvati

729
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,830
trying to line it up.

730
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,874
>> Okay.

731
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,000
>> Drop, drop, drop, drop!

732
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,001
>> PROBST: Jonathan releases a

733
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:03,668
cannonball for Raro.

734
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,670
>> Backwards.

735
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,880
Straight back.

736
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:07,756
>> PROBST: Misses the target.

737
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,757
>> Backpedal a little bit, just

738
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,300
a little.

739
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:10,926
>> PROBST: Aitu, can they get

740
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,677
the crosshairs lined up?

741
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:16,723
>> Just a little bit, drop!

742
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,309
>> PROBST: No luck.

743
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:21,102
This challenge demands that you

744
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,771
work together well.

745
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:23,772
>> Brad, paddle a little bit on

746
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,815
your side.

747
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,025
>> PROBST: Raro easing into

748
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:27,943
it...

749
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,277
>> Okay, a little bit more.

750
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,278
>> PROBST: ...gently.

751
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,613
>> Now.

752
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,531
>> Yes!

753
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,200
>> PROBST: Raro has the first

754
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:35,742
pair of buoys.

755
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:36,660
>> My god!

756
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:37,744
>> Nice, guys!

757
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:40,455
>> Here we go-- one, two, three,

758
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:42,040
drop.

759
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,792
>> PROBST: Aitu misses again.

760
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,461
>> Here we go.

761
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:48,713

762
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,799

>> PROBST: Raro taking a shot at

764
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,261
their second set of buoys.

765
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,303
>> Wait.

766
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,055
>> Okay, ready?

767
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,056
>> Drop!

768
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,057
>> Yes!

769
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,308
>> PROBST: Raro releases their

770
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,227
second set of buoys.

771
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,272
Raro now leads two sets of buoys

772
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,898
to none for Aitu.

773
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:10,443
>> Right there.

774
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,028
>> PROBST: Aitu very close to

775
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,572
their buoys.

776
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,699
>> Should I just go for it?

777
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,033
>> No.

778
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,452
>> I think I got it.

779
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,079
I got it!

780
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,247
See?

781
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,206
>> Oh, my gosh!

782
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,207
>> PROBST: Aitu releases their

783
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,250

Raro heading to their final set

785
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:28,545
of buoys...

786
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:28,878
>> Okay, wait.

787
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:29,754
All right, we're going to have

788
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:30,672
to backpedal.

789
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,465
>> PROBST: ...and drifting off

790
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:33,174
course.

791
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:33,967
>> Just keep doing what we're

792
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:34,801
doing.

793
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:35,719
We're doing good.

794
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:36,970
>> PROBST: Aitu trying to get

795
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:37,804
their second set of buoys.

>> We're very close.

797
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:40,682
Okay.

798
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,600
Okay, yes.

799
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:46,021
Yes, we're... try it.

800
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,315
>> PROBST: Aitu misses again.

801
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,649
>> Through here.

802
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:50,650
>> Hold on, hold on, hold on.

803
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:54,070
He sees it.

804
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,367
>> Yes!

805
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,285
>> PROBST: Aitu connects with

806
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,786
their second set of buoys.

807
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:05,665
We are now tied, two sets each.

808
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,208
>> I can spot the thing through

809
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:07,709
the...

810
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,669
>> Shhh!

811
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:10,295
>> PROBST: Both tribes now with

812
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,339
one target left.

813
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,214
>> All right, all right, let's

814
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,884
get the last one, guys.

815
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:21,014
>> And go, go, go!

816
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,140
>> Release again, release!

817
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,308
Backwards.

818
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,392
We missed it.

819
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,560
>> PROBST: Raro misses again.

820
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:29,147
>> We're going to lose all

821
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,106
our...

822
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:30,982
>> Raro just wasted a

823
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:31,941
cannonball.

824
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,109
They weren't paying attention.

825
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,194
>> Oh, please, Jeff.

826
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,362
>> PROBST: What's that?

827
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:35,820

829

frustrated by me.

Day 21.

831
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,578
>> We're going to drift over it.

832
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:44,704
>> PROBST: Aitu sees their

833
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,915
target.

834
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,254
>> Yeah!

835
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,089
>> Yes!

836
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,090
>> PROBST: Aitu takes a shot and

837
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,174
releases their third set of

838
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,759
buoys.

839
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,427
Aitu now has all three sets.

840
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,012
They can begin paddling back to

841
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,597
shore.

842
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,807
Raro still right on top of their

843
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,891
third set of buoys.

844
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,602
Going after another shot.

845
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:07,894
>> I got it!

846
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,813
>> PROBST: Aitu has all their

847
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,356
buoys.

848
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,441
They're paddling back to shore.

849
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,151
Raro not giving up!

850
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:15,902
Got to hit that third target!

851
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,738
>> Now!

852
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,116
>> We blew it!

853
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,575
>> Did it drop?

854
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,576
>> All right, we're on the mat.

855
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,702
>> PROBST: Aitu back to the mat.

856
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,079
Got to get all their buoys back

857
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,664
to the big mat.

858
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:30,125
>> Let's go!

859
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,085
>> Jonathan, paddle forward.

860
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,628
Don't watch them.

861
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:34,170
Look at what we're doing.

862
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,881
>> All right, this says "The

863
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:37,924
most famous mutiny in history

864
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:41,261
occurred aboard this ship."

865
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,096
>> PROBST: Aitu working to get

866
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:43,930
this puzzle together.

867
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,982
Bounty.

868
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,192
Aitu wins immunity!

869
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:59,904
>> Yeah!

870
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,490
>> Are you kidding me?

871
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,659
>> Son of a...

872
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:06,744
>> PROBST: Well, Aitu, another

873
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:07,787
big win today.

874
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:08,997
Immunity, no tribal council,

875
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,415
nobody going home.

876
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:10,874
>> Thanks, Jeff.

877
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:14,002
>> PROBST: On the other side of

878
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,546
the coin, Raro, two big losses.

879
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:17,046
Tribal council tonight.

880
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,007
Somebody from this tribe will be

881
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,550
voted out of this game.

882
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:21,509
Grab your stuff, head back to

883
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,260
camp.

884
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,471
I'll see you at tribal.

885
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:51,706
>> I'm so bummed out.

886
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:53,208
>> So sorry, guys.

887
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,042
>> Goodness, gracious, that was

888
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,670
stupid.

889
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:58,171
>> I saw you say that...

890
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:58,755
>> I'm a little hungry, but it

891
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,548
was...

892
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,674
>> Well, luckily, you were only

893
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:02,592
out there one night and it

894
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:03,051
wasn't raining, right?

895
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,136
>> Yeah, yeah.

896
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,638
>> I'm happy to have Candice

897
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:07,805
back from Exile Island.

898
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,057
It takes a little bit of the

899
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,016
onus off of me being the only

900
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,935
new guy.

901
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,186
They can see who the two of us

902
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:14,395
are, and she and I have trusted

903
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,022
each other.

904
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,459
>> Not tight.

905
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,252
>> Not tight?

906
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,086
Not too tight?

907
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:38,920
>> No.

908
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:39,254
>> Okay, good.

909
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:39,879
>> Not too tight at all.

910
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,090
I was shocked.

911
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,299
He had, like, long talks with

912
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,717
Yul all the time.

913
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:45,343
And he only really came back and

914
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,136
tried to, like, solidify

915
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,680
something with me in the past

916
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:49,097
few days.

917
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,307
He's just doing whatever is best

918
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,308
for him and, like, working

919
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,226
everybody at the same time, you

920
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,478
know what I mean?

921
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:03,528
>> What's up?

922
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,985
>> Jonathan, AKA "Lord Knows

923
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,028
What He's Thinking Knucklehead,"

924
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:48,072
to leave his tribe, is working

925
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:51,075
very hard around here.

926
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,952
So right now, we're going to do

927
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,454
away with Brad, because we're

928
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,873
scared if we go to a merge, he's

929
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:59,584
going to go with Becky and Yul.

930
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:00,877
I've got to put a Denzel on

931
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,129
today and play Brad like it's

932
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,297
all good, you know, like, keep

933
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,298
him in the loop.

934
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,716
He thinks I'm out to cut up

935
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,675
Jonathan, so I'm going to let

936
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,761
him think he's safe.

937
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:12,680
(<i> yawns</i> )

938
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,931
What's up, brother?

939
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:14,265
>> What's up?

940
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,058
Were you sleeping?

941
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,101
>> Uh-huh.

942
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,661
>> Who?

943
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,596
>> Okay, that's fine.

944
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:42,270
>> Candice informed me that

945
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,187
Jonathan's been running his

946
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,273
mouth a little bit, just talking

947
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,900
trash, which I think is funny

948
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,235
because now he's kissing my butt

949
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,363
along with everybody else's butt

950
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,656
in our tribe.

951
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,866
So he can just kiss our butts,

952
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,033
and we'll go ahead and vote him

953
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,326
off after that.

954
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:16,888
>> I want to get rid of that

955
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:17,722
kid.

956
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:18,598
I mean, now he's kissing

957
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:19,557
everyone's butt after that.

958
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,308
>> I told you, man, he's a punk-

959
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:20,475
ass...

960
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,018
>> I know he is.

961
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:22,894
He's a punk.

962
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:23,728
But, I mean, we can't switch

963
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:24,645
now.

964
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,855
I'm going to beat his ass.

965
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,732
>> He's a punk.

966
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:28,983
>> He's a punk.

967
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,860
>> My man Adam wants to take a

968
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:34,155
brick and beat Jonathan in the

969
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,156
head with it.

970
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,200
>> You know, I told you I

971
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,201
smelled dookie, dog.

972
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,118
>> Pisses me off.

973
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,286
>> But we've got to think smart.

974
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,288
Game's not over yet, so it's a

975
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,415
fair playing ground.

976
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,609
>> PROBST: Looks like it's going

977
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,528
to be a wet night.

978
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,320
So let's talk about the mutiny.

979
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,614
Brad, when you saw Candice step

980
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:19,367
off the mat, followed right

981
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,118
behind by Jonathan, what was

982
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,496
your initial thought?

983
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:24,205
>> My initial thought was, "Wow,

984
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,833
that is one gutsy girl."

985
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,751
I mean, here she has four people

986
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,336
now vying against her.

987
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,421
>> PROBST: Jenny, is there a

988
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,589
part of you thinking, "Well, you

989
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,882
know what, that's okay"?

990
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:35,883
They're at the bottom of the

991
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,009
totem pole.

992
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:37,510
They need to know that.

993
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:38,344
>> Even though they're on the

994
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:41,138
bottom of the totem pole we have

995
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,181
an advantage compared to the

996
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,224
Aitu.

997
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,642
And if we merge, we're just

998
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:45,852
going to pick them off like

999
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:49,856
zits.

1000
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,232
I've been hanging around Nate

1001
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,276
too long.

1002
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,193
>> PROBST: Candice, are you okay

1003
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,445
with the fact that this tribe

1004
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,989
comes to tribal council, where

1005
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,907
somebody is going to be voted

1006
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:00,491
out, and there's joking and

1007
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,451
laughter?

1008
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,786
>> I think that's the great

1009
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,163
thing about this tribe, and it's

1010
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:05,788
one of the reasons I stepped out

1011
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,164
on the mat.

1012
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,292
I felt like this tribe has a

1013
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,543
good time.

1014
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,627
>> PROBST: So you're telling me,

1015
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,170
Candice, that you stepped off

1016
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,089
that mat because you could just

1017
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:16,841
sense that Raro was just a lot

1018
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:17,884
more fun?

1019
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:18,843
>> I didn't say that was the

1020
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:19,802
only reason.

1021
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:20,887
That's one of the reasons.

1022
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:21,512
I mean, they win when it counts.

1023
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,764
>> PROBST: Jonathan, are you a

1024
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,308
little bit concerned that "I

1025
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:26,684
could be an easy guy to get rid

1026
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:27,768
of?"

1027
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:28,811
Because they didn't invite you

1028
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:29,854
over.

1029
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:30,855
You were given the opportunity

1030
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:31,981
to just join them.

1031
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,065
>> Of course I'm concerned, you

1032
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,192
know?

1033
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:34,817
I was the last guy off the mat.

1034
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:35,401
Maybe it was a second later.

1035
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:38,029
But yes, you know, somebody's

1036
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,739
going to go home tonight, and

1037
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:40,907
I'd be silly if I didn't think

1038
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,283
it could be me.

1039
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,284
>> PROBST: Nate, what's your

1040
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:48,414
take on this unit right now as a

1041
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,416
tribe, or as a family, whatever

1042
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,918
you want to call it?

1043
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,628
>> My six I had yesterday before

1044
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,379
mutiny, I was all good with.

1045
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,548
The other two coming in, Candice

1046
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,300
and Jonathan, they seem very

1047
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,718
nice, so, you know, we're still

1048
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,136
adapting to them.

1049
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:02,762
I can't really give you a fair,

1050
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:03,387
honest answer about them because

1051
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,264
I'm still reading them.

1052
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,099
>> PROBST: What would be the

1053
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,392
concern about Candice?

1054
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,561
>> Oh, the girls may find her as

1055
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,021
a threat because she's pretty

1056
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,856
lethal-- the only female who has

1057
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,483
ever been to exile, and, you

1058
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,109
know, she comes up with her head

1059
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,235
high from it, too.

1060
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,278
And, like, she's a very strong

1061
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,279
competitor.

1062
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,572
The girl came to play.

1063
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,740
>> PROBST: What would be your

1064
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:23,950
concern about Jonathan coming

1065
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,284
over?

1066
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,495
>> Maybe he has a tendency to be

1067
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,913
too much of a leader, and we

1068
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,248
don't dig that over here.

1069
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:30,790
We find out you're leading

1070
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,541
around here, we'll cut you up,

1071
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,793
you know?

1072
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:36,212
>> PROBST: Jonathan, hearing

1073
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,797
Nate say that, is it a fair

1074
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,049
assessment?

1075
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,676
>> You know, yes, I'm an odd man

1076
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,052
out at this point, and I do want

1077
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,261
to fit in.

1078
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,304
You know, in the last 24 hours,

1079
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,348
I think I've at least tried to

1080
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,808
certainly not step on anybody's

1081
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:49,350
toes and tried to, you know,

1082
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,602
provide.

1083
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,145
>> PROBST: Brad, did you sense

1084
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,064
any tension in this tribe?

1085
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:57,149
>> I like Jonathan.

1086
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:57,692
I like Candice from the six

1087
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,485
hours that I know of.

1088
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:00,319
I've got no qualms with them.

1089
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,530
The only thing is, they're

1090
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:03,906
stepping in late in the ball

1091
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,074
game, and that's what I can see

1092
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:05,658
as a huge deterrent for them

1093
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:06,534
being successful within this

1094
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,411
tribe.

1095
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,370
And that's it.

1096
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,454
That's the bottom line.

1097
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,664
>> PROBST: Do you trust these

1098
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,040
people in this tribe now?

1099
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:13,457
>> No.

1100
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,751
>> PROBST: Wow.

1101
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,586
You don't trust this big, happy

1102
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,838
family?

1103
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,172
>> Do I trust the entire tribe?

1104
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:20,548
Absolutely not.

1105
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,925
I'm sorry.

1106
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,052
It's been 21 days, and trust is

1107
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,387
a big word to me, Jeff, and no,

1108
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,471
I don't trust everyone on this

1109
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,473
tribe.

1110
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,558
>> PROBST: Okay.

1111
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:31,809
If somebody has the hidden

1112
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,227
immunity idol, and it turns out

1113
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:33,853
that you do need to play it, you

1114
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,396
would present it to me after the

1115
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,814
vote.

1116
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,232
The person with the next highest

1117
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:38,816
number of votes would go home.

1118
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:39,567
It is time to vote.

1119
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,528
Candice, you're up.

1120
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,168
>> Obviously, this is nothing

1121
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,627
personal, but I'm hoping I'm not

1122
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,046
the only one to vote for you.

1123
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,672
Good luck.

1124
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,807
>> I think you're a good guy, a

1125
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,059
good leader, and a good father,

1126
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,643
but you're coming in way too

1127
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,355
late in the game.

1128
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,099
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1129
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,393
votes.

1130
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:05,361
Once the votes are read, the

1131
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:06,403
decision is final.

1132
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,404
The person voted out will be

1133
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:07,947
asked to leave the tribal

1134
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:08,489

Brad, that's five, that's

1151
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:55,744
enough.

1152
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:56,579
Unless you have the hidden

>> Candice I'm a bit leery about

1183

1184
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,398

of my entire life.

1193
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,210
I didn't know I was going.

1194
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,795
I didn't know what was brewing.

1195
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:28,963
It's kind of a sigh of relief

1196
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,089
for me.

1197
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,382

1198
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:31,757
bittersweet.

1199
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,676

game.

1201
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,345
And making jury just proves that

1202
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:37,721
point.
