00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,715
WHO I THOUGHT WAS ON THE BOTTOM,

84
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:12,882
DAWN.

85
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,759
DAWN WAS NEVER WITH ME.

>> THEY HAVE NO IDOL.

00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,769
EVEN IF THEY HAVE ONE IDOL, WE

95
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:25,937
CAN SPLIT IT.

96
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,479
WE CAN SPLIT IT.

97
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,438

98
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:27,730

99
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,190
THAT'S WHAT WE JUST SAID.

100
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,526
>> TOMORROW WE'RE GOING TO FIND

101
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:32,402
THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

AND SEARCH.

104
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,156
IF THERE'S ANY SILVER LINING, I

105
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,950
STILL HAVE AN IDOL.

106
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,202
I STILL HAVE SOME POWER, JUST A

107
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,245
LITTLE BIT.

108
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,038
I'M NOT GOING DOWN WITHOUT

109
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:44,289
FIREWORKS.

110
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,665

111
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,542
WE'RE NOT GOING DOWN NEXT.

112
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,167

00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:52,380
>> I'D RATHER BY MY OWN MAN THAN

114
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:55,466
BE A PUPPET FOR PHILLIP.

115
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,965
I DON'T THINK THAT NECESSARILY

116
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:36,299
IS THE CASE.

117
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,844
SHE'S A BETRAYED A LOT OF

WHAT'S WRONG?

136
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:19,217
>> THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING.

137
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,511

00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,030
IT'S OVER!

379
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,157
>> YEAH!

380
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,954
>> Jeff: PURPLE WINS REWARD.

381
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:30,666
>> OH, YEAH!

382
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,669
AWESOME JOB.

383
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,379
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, REYNOLD,

384
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,423
DAWN, ERIK, COCHRAN, PHILLIP,

385
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,924
NICE JOB.

386
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,177
NICE REWARD.

387
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:41,635
HAVE A GOOD AFTERNOON.

388
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,053
>> THANK YOU.

389
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,930
>> Jeff: MALCOLM, BRENDA,

390
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,515
SHERRY, EDDIE, ANDREA, GOT

391
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,475
NOTHING FOR YOU.

392
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,227
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

393
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,687
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

394
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:09,371
>> HI, GUYS.

395
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:09,997
WELCOME.

396
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,750
WE HAVE PREPARED SOME FOOD AND

397
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,626
DRINKS FOR YOU.

398
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,628
TAKE A SHOWER, SIT BACK, RELAX,

399
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:16,378
AND ENJOY YOUR AFTERNOON.

400
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,338
>> THANK YOU!

401
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,381
>> FORGIVE US, WE'RE STARVING.

402
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,884
>> REYNOLD, DAWN, ERIK, PHILLIP

403
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:22,968
AND I WALKED INTO OUR REWARD

404
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,179
RESORT AND WE WERE GREETED BY A

405
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,347
TABLE FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH

406
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:32,269
ALL SORTS OF SHRIMP KABOBS, BEEF

407
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,813
KABOBS, FRIED CHICKEN, CALAMARI.

408
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,398
>> I HAVE NOT HAD ANY BEEF IN

409
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,691
WELL OVER A MONTH.

410
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,735
>> OH, GOODNESS.

411
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,612
PROTEIN IS IMPORTANT IN ONE'S

412
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:42,863
DIET, AND THIS IS THE SORT OF

413
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:43,948
ENERGY I NEED TO GO INTO

414
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,283
CHALLENGE AND TO CONTINUE TO BE

415
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,077
THE CHALLENGE MONSTER I THINK I

416
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,580
HAVE PROVEN MYSELF TO BE.

417
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,206
>> I REALIZED I HADN'T TURNED A

418
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,374
SHOWERHEAD ON IN 26 DAYS.

419
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,750
>> THERE'S SOAP!

420
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,043
>> JUST THE SMELL OF THE SOAP

421
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,836
WAS OVERPOWERING.

422
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,296
THIS MIGHT BE MY FAVORITE PART!

423
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,464
I NEEDED IT.

424
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,299
I'D BEEN LOSING MY MARBLES.

425
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,842
AND I THINK THE THING THAT'S

426
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:04,468
HARDEST FOR ME TO PROCESS ABOUT

427
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,094
THE GAME IS THAT IT MAKES YOU

428
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,013
FEEL KIND OF SCHIZOPHRENIC, HOW

429
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:13,477
QUICKLY THE EMOTIONS CHANGE.

430
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,145
>> OKAY, MUCH-NEEDED SHOWER.

431
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,439
>> THIS CLOUD JUST CAME OFF OF

432
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:17,606
YOU.

433
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,899
>> PHILLIP'S ETIQUETTE IS NOT

434
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:19,692
THE BEST.

435
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,027
THERE'S A SHOWER TO WASH OFF IN,

436
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,321
BUT PHILLIP DIVES INTO THE FOOD

437
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,116
AND GETS MUD AND RICE AND ALL

438
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,285
THIS HORRIBLE DIRTINESS INTO THE

439
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:29,451
POOL.

440
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,035
>> YOU'RE NAKED.

441
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,120
>> I'M NAKED?

442
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,080
>> THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT

443
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,540
PHILLIP HAS DONE THE WHOLE

444
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,709
SEASON, JUST JUMPS IN WITHOUT

445
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,460
CARE FOR ANYBODY ELSE, DOES

446
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,795
THINGS ON HIS OWN.

447
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:41,088
I'M REALLY SICK OF PHILLIP BEING

448
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:41,297
AROUND.

449
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:47,011
>> I'M LOVING LIFE.

450
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,073
>> I'M EXHAUSTED.

451
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,076
I THINK I'VE PROBABLY SLEPT TWO

452
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,745
TO FOUR HOURS IN THE LAST THREE

453
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:12,953
DAYS.

454
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,997
MY BRAIN HAS NOT RESTED, SO I'VE

455
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,290
BECOME NERVOUS ABOUT HOW THE

456
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,291
NEXT STAGE OF THE GAME IS GOING

457
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,334
TO PLAY OUT.

458
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,461
I'M PARANOID ABOUT BEING

459
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,962
BLINDSIDED, YOU KNOW.

460
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,672
I IN THE SEVEN?

461
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:24,965
AND ARE THE PEOPLE I THINK HAVE

462
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,258
BEEN ALIGNED WITH ME REALLY

463
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:32,014
ALIGNED WITH ME?

464
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,849
ANDREA HAS BEEN SPENDING MOST OF

465
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:36,060
HER TIME WITH MALCOLM AND WITH

466
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:36,268
EDDIE.

467
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,102
I MEAN, SHE'S SO ASSIMILATED

468
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,812
WITH THEM.

469
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,898
AND IF EDDIE, REYNOLD, AND

470
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,691
MALCOLM WERE ABLE TO PULL

471
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,443
SOMEONE FROM OUR SEVEN OVER,

472
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:44,943
THEY COULD BLINDSIDE ME.

473
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,987
>> IF ANDREA FLIPS WITH MALCOLM

474
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,073
AND THEY SPLIT A VOTE, THEY NEED

475
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,158
FOUR TO TAKE ME OUT.

476
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,910
THEY HAVE FOUR.

477
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:53,661
SHE'S GOING TO DO IT.

478
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,371
>> LISTEN TO ME, ANDREA WOULD BE

479
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,705
ONE OF THE TARGETS.

480
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,290
YOU SCREW UP, YOU GO AGAINST THE

481
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,249
ALLIANCE, WE BOOT YOU OUT.

482
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,544
I SAY TO THEM, ANDREA WOULD IN

483
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,879
FACT BE THE FIRST TARGET BUT I

484
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:04,421
MIGHT BE LOOKING AT SOMEBODY

485
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,089
ELSE RIGHT NOW.

486
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:08,050
DAWN!

487
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,134
TRUE GRIT ABUSE SHE'S TOTALLY A

488
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,470
LUNATIC AND SHE'S LOSING HER

489
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,096
COMPOSURE OUT HERE.

490
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,263
ARE YOU NOT THE TARGET.

491
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,807
AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR

492
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,433
YOU TO DO IS ACT LIKE YOU

493
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,976
NORMALLY DO ON DAYS LIKE TODAY.

494
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,144
>> DAWN'S CONVINCED THAT ANDREA

495
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,648
IS GOING TO FLIP OVER AND VOTE

496
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,650
HER, DAWN, OUT.

497
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,527
HOW DAWN IS SO CONFIDENT SHE'S

498
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,152
THE PERSON THAT WOULD BE ON THE

499
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,739
RECEIVING END OF THIS VOTE IS

500
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,241
BAFFLING TO ME.

501
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,033
IT'S MAKING ME SUSPICIOUS OF

502
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:38,997
DAWN, QUITE FRANKLY.

503
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,553
>> CAN WE PUT THIS BACK ON?

504
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,053
>> YOU WANT MORE?

505
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:57,182
>> YEAH.

506
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,351
>> I'M A HAPPIER PERSON NOT

507
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,728
HUNGRY.

508
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:01,311
OR TIRED.

509
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,813
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

510
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:03,272
IT'S SO HARD ON ME.

511
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,858
>> WHAT?

512
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,193
WHAT HAPPENED?

513
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:19,913
I NEED A BREAK.

514
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,582
ALL I DID WAS TAKE A PIECE OF

515
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:21,790
COCONUT.

516
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:22,791
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE--

517
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,501
>> YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING?

518
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,294
>> I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

519
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,463
>> SHE'S OUT OF CONTROL.

520
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:27,796
THIS ISN'T GOOD.

521
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,464
>> OKAY.

522
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,090
>> SHE'S LIVING IN A WORLD OF

523
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,008
TONIGHT PARANOIA.

524
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:37,097
>> SHE'S-- YEAH.

525
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,724
>> I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE

526
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,434
CLOSE QUARTERS.

527
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,561
>> THERE'S NO ESCAPE, YEAH.

528
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:46,023
>> I MEAN, HONESTLY FEEL LIKE

529
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:46,315
UNSTABLE.

530
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,107
>> IT'S OVERWHELMING.

531
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,068
>> I THINK I MIGHT NEED SOME

532
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,404
TIME JUST ALONE OR SOMETHING.

533
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,238
SORRY, COCHRAN.

534
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:57,534
I'M TOUGHER THAN THIS.

535
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,496
>> YOU'RE STILL BEING VERY

536
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:00,662
TOUGH.

537
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,622
JUST CRY OR WHATEVER.

538
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,124
>> I CRY MORE THAN A BABY.

539
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:04,374
LITERALLY.

540
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:08,921
>> WE HAD ONE WHO FLEW OVER THE

541
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,173
CUCKOO'S NEST, HANTZ, HE'S GONE.

542
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,425
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S ANOTHER

543
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,843
POSSIBLE HUMMING BIRD ZIPPING

544
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,346
OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, AND HER

545
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:17,679
NAME IS DAWN.

546
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,640
>> I'M SO TIRED OF CRYING.

547
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,332
>> I SLEPT.

548
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,001
>> THAT'S GOOD.

549
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,754
>> OH, MY GOSH.

550
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,047
>> DID YOU STAY DRY?

551
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,508
>> YEAH I SLEPT THAT WHOLE

552
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:54,716
NIGHT.

553
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,217
>> NICE.

554
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,385
THAT'S GOOD.

555
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:56,552
>> YA.

556
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,136
TODAY IS DAY 28.

557
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,346
THE DAY I WENT HOME LAST TIME I

558
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:02,266
PLAYED, BUT AFTER ALL OF

559
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:05,060
YESTERDAY, AND MY, YOU KNOW,

560
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,603
MELTDOWN TORNADO, I WOKE UP

561
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,438
TODAY FEELING LIKE MYSELF.

562
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,274
I FEEL LIKE MY HEAD'S CLEAR, THE

563

750
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,466
IT IS NECK AND NECK BETWEEN

751
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,717
REYNOLD AND MALCOLM.

752
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,344
REYNOLD IS OUT OF THE WATER

753
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,136
FIRST.

754
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,930
MALCOLM NOW STRUGGLING.

755
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,432
REYNOLD WITH HIS FOURTH RING.

756
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:18,767
MALCOLM WITH HIS FOURTH RING,

757
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,768
ONE RING LEFT.

758
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,603
THIS IS IT!

759
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:27,234
RIGHT HERE!

760
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:27,817
WHO WILL POP OUT OF THE WATER

761
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:31,655
FIRST?

762
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:38,578
IT IS REYNOLD.

763
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,789
REYNOLD WINS IMMUNITY!

764
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,540
>> DID I DO IT!

765
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:46,711
>> YEAH, YOU DID IT!

766
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,922
>> Jeff: EVERYBODY GAVE

767
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,674
EVERYTHING THEY HAD.

768
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:51,675
REYNOLD, YOU GOT ENOUGH ENERGY

769
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,718
TO SWIM OVER AND GET IMMUNITY?

770
00:25:53,802 --> 00:26:03,353
>> YEAH!

771
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,814
>> Jeff: REYNOLD,

772
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:06,147
CONGRATULATIONS.

773
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,440
GOING INTO TRIBAL COUNCIL SAFE

774
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,024
TONIGHT, GUARANTEE AID ONE IN

775
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,860
NINE SHOT AT WINNING THIS GAME.

776
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,237
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, SOMEBODY

777
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,280
GOING HOME TONIGHT.

778
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,489
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

779
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:16,241
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

780
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:16,866
I'LL SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.

781
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,604
>> ANYBODY ELSE DESTROYED?

782
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:47,188
>> ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE CUT

783
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:47,397
THROAT.

784
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,357
THEY WANT ME OUT, I'M THE

785
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:49,691
BIGGEST THREAT.

786
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,526
I HAVE THE IMMUNITY NECKLACE,

787
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:52,152
I'M GOING TO DO WHATEVER I WANT.

788
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,112
>> NICE JOB, REYNOLD.

789
00:26:54,195 --> 00:27:00,327
>> I HAVE RESPECT FOR ALL OF

790
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,579
YOU.

791
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,080
>> I HAVE NO RESPECT FOR

792
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:04,331
PHILLIP.

793
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,665
I MEAN, WHEN WHATWHEN IT BOILS

794
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,793
DOWN TO IT, HE'S ALL TALK.

795
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:09,669
HE'S NO ACTION.

796
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:13,506
I THINK IT'S SACK RELIGIOUS NOT

797
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:18,011
TO PARTICIPATE IN AN IMMUNITY

798
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:20,221
CHALLENGE, ESPECIALLY AND I HAVE

799
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,223
LIONS AND GORILLAS TATTOOED ON

800
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:22,474
YOUR BODY.

801
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,392
COME ON, MAN.

802
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,018
>> I WANTED TO SPEAK TO YOU FOR

803
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,478
A SECOND, IF I COULD.

804
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:29,814
>> ALL RIGHT.

805
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:30,023
UPON.

806
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:30,857
>> WE'RE GONNA STILL SPLIT?

807
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,983
>> OKAY.

808
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,818
>> I'M FINALLY IN THE LEADERSHIP

809
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:34,069
POSITION.

810
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,695
I FEEL LIKE I MIGHT JUST

811
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,989
MIGHT HAVE A SHOT OF GETTING TO

812
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:38,740
THE FINAL THREE.

813
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:39,824
AND IF THESE PEOPLE AREN'T

814
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,077
BITTER, I MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE A

815
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,161
SHOT OF WINNING.

816
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:44,871
>> HERE'S MY PLAN SO THAT YOU

817
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:45,080
KNOW.

818
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:45,789
WE'RE GONNA SPLIT THE VOTES.

819
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:48,917
ONE OF THE BEAUTEZ OF BEING

820
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,379
NUMBERS OF 7-3, IS THAT IT

821
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:52,921
DOESN'T MATTER.

822
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:56,091
MALCOLM CAN HAVE AN IDOL, AND IT

823
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,884
WOULD BE FOUR MALCOLM, THREE

824
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:58,093
EDDIE.

825
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,345
SO ONE OF THOSE TWO ARE GOING TO

826
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,471
GO HOME.

827
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:02,972
MALCOLM DISTRIBUTE HAVE AN IDOL.

828
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,015
SO HE'S SITTING THERE

829
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:08,311
( WHISTLING )

830
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:17,529
AND BYE-BYE.

831
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:18,780
>> MY HEAD IN THE GUILLOTINE

832
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,116
RIGHT NOW, BUT THE IDEA NOW IS I

833
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,075
HAVE THE IDOL.

834
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:22,784
NO MATTER WHAT.

835
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,578
I PLAY THAT THING, I'M NOT GOING

836
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:25,787
HOME.

837
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,455
BUT THE IDEA IS TO GET THROUGH

838
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,791
THIS VOTE AND STILL HAVE THE

839
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:29,958
IDOL.

840
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,211
I HAVE A FEELING THAT WE'VE JUST

841
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:33,461
MISSED.

842
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:37,006
>> I'M ALL FOR LOOKING FOR

843
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:37,424
IDOLS, DUDE.

844
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,843
>> I'M CONVINCED IT'S ON THIS

845
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:40,051
PATH.

846
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:40,301
>> HERE?

847
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,095
>> YEAH.

848
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,638
THE POSSIBILITY STILL EXISTS

849
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:44,806
THERE'S ANOTHE IDOL ON THE OUT

850
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,391
THERE AND I HAVE A FEW HOURS,

851
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,767
AND NOTHING ELSE TO DO, AND NO

852
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,227
ONE ELSE HAS ASKED, SO MAYBE

853
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:49,894
THIS DREAM WILL COME TRUE.

854
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,938
>> I GOT TRAPPED ONCE AS A BOY.

855
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,899
I WAS AT A POND.

856
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,609
AND THEY HAD ONE OF THOSE

857
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,569
THINGS-- SO I THINK-- I THINK

858
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,863
THE HOTTEST PLACE FOR THE IDOL

859
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,156
IS THE INTROONS TO THE WATER.

860
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,115
>> GRAY.

861
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,825
>> AFTER THE CHALLENGE, ANDREA

862
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,201
IS LIKE LET'S LOOK FOR THE IDOL

863
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,619
AND I SAY ABSOLUTELY.

864
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,663
BECAUSE IT'S TIME TO WORK,

865
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:08,872
PEOPLE.

866
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,123
I DON'T KNOW WHY PEOPLE SIT

867
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,541
AROUND SO MUCH AT CAMP.

868
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:12,625
THERE'S A MILLION DOLLARS.

869
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:15,003
>> SO IT WAS, LIKE... LIKE, NOT

870
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:15,170
FUN.

871
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:21,259
>> YEAH, I DON'T WANT TO DO

872
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,971
THAT.

873
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,230
>> THIS STUPID THING COULD BE

874
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,274
ANYWHERE.

875
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,735
>> I MEAN, IT'S A NEED UNTIL A

876
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:46,951
HAYSTACK.

877
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,912
JUST LET ME KNOW IF IT'S BACK

878
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,288
THERE.

879
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:50,955
I WILL COME HELP.

880
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:51,998
>> I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CONTAIN

881
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:52,207
MYSELF.

882
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,209
>> WOULD IT BE TOO MUCH FOR A

883
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:54,542
CLUE?

884
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,544
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

885
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,462
>> WHAT?

886
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:02,884
>> YOU SAID THAT.

887
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,761
>> YOU JUST FOUND IT.

888
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,346
>> YOU JUST SAID THAT AND I SAW

889
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:06,513
IT.

890
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,014
>> OH, MY GOD.

891
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:10,058
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

892
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,143
I THINK YOU HAD IT HIDDEN.

893
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,355
>> I SWEAR TO GOD I JUST SAW IT.

894
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,856
>> ALL OF A SUDDEN MALCOLM REACH

895
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:21,444
INTIEZ ROARKE FINDS THE HIDDEN

896
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,445
IMMUNITYITE IDOL RIGHT IN FRONT

897
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:22,820
OF US.

898
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,781
>> MALCOLM, WAY TO GO.

899
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:25,949
GOOD FOR YOU.

900
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,409
>> MALCOLM WAS SUPPOSED TO GO

901
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,286
HOME, BUT HE FOUND THE HIDDEN

902
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,538
IMMUNITY IDOL EXACTLY WHEN HE

903
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,414
NEEDED TO FIND IT.

904
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:38,753
SO EDDIE HAS TO GO NOW.

905
00:30:38,836 --> 00:30:39,754
MALCOLM JUT FOUND THE IDOL.

906
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:40,672
>> IN FRONT OF YOU?

907
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,131
>> YEAH, WE WERE RIGHT BY HIM.

>> HAD HIM OPEN IT IN FRONT OF

909
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:47,178
US.

910
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,054
>> SAME PLAN.

911
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:50,223
MAYBE HE WON'T PLAY IT.

912
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,099
LET'S NOT GET FANCY.

913
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,643
IF HE PLAYS IT, WHICH I ASSUME

914
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,395
HE WILL, THERE'S GOING TO BE A

915
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:55,603
REVOTE.

916
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,522
>> PERFECT.

00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,899
>>Y KNOW HE HAS IT.

918

00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,151
>> HE SHOWED IT TO YOU?

920
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,278
>> YEAH, WE SAW IT.

921
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:03,611
>> WHO CARES.

922
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,279
>> OKAY.

923
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:09,325
>> WE GOT THE NUMBERS.

924
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:19,168
>> SO MALCOLM IS PROTECTED

925
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:19,419
TONIGHT.

926
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,004
AND REYNOLD WON IMMUNITY.

927
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,589
NOW I'M DOUBLE SCREWED BECAUSE

928
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,798
MY ONLY CHANCE FOR STAYING

929
00:31:23,881 --> 00:31:25,008
ANOTHER DAY WAS IF THEY DECIDED

930
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,009
TO VOTE OFF MALCOLM INSTEAD OF

931
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:26,175
ME.

932
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:29,178
ASK NOW THE ENTIRE CAMP KNOWS HE

933
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:32,974
HAS THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

934
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:38,771
I'M GOING HOME.

935
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,655
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

936
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:53,828

937
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:56,247
MICHAEL, VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

938
00:31:56,331 --> 00:32:02,670
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

939
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,756
SO BASED ON THE LAST TRIBAL

940
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,633
COUNCIL, REYNOLD, IT WOULD SEEM

941
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,760
THAT YOU, EDDIE, AND MALCOLM ARE

942
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:09,969
STILL ON THE OUTS.

943
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,680
>> DEFINITELY AGREE WITH THAT,

944
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:12,847
YEAH.

945
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,057
SO FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, I FELT

946
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,558
LIKE IT WAS PRETTY MUCH WIN

947
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,060
IMMUNITY OR YOU'RE GOING HOME

948
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,561
TONIGHT SCENARIO.

949
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,687
>> Jeff: EDDIE, WOULD YOU

950
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,229
AGREE WITH THAT?

951
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,564
>> YEAH, I MEAN, ONE OF THE

952
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,066
THREE OF US IS GOING TO NEED TO

953
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,400
WIN IT EVERY TIME IN ORDER TO

954
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:24,692
KEEP GOING.

955
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,402
BUT YOU TRY TO TAKE ALL THE

956
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,071
POSITIVE YOU CAN FROM THE WHOLE

957
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,657
EXPERIENCE, YOU KNOW.

958
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,241
EVERYTHING I'VE DONE I'LL

959
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:32,659
REMEMBER FOREVER.

960
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,494
>> Jeff: ANDREA, EDDIE IS

961
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,078
TALKING LIKE HE'S GONE.

962
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,038
>> IT'S VERY TRUE.

963
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,956
EVERYONE IS LOOKING AT EDDIE,

964
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,917
BECAUSE MALCOLM HAPPENED UPON

965
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,044
THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

966
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,462
>> Jeff: SO EVERYONE KNOWS YOU

967
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:45,171
HAVE AN IDOL.

968
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:45,672
>> WE WERE RIGHT THERE.

969
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:46,381
>> YEAH.

970
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,758
>> DAWN AND I WERE WALKING, AND

971
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:49,759
MALCOLM TURNS AROUND AND FINDS

972
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:52,637
IT IN A ROCK.

973
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:52,887
SO HE--

974
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,180
>> PRETTY STOKED.

975
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,223
>> REYNOLD WON WHEN HE NEEDED

976
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,600
TO, AND HE FOUND HIS IDOL WHEN

977
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,060
HE NEEDED TO.

978
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,480
>> Jeff: SO THAT, COCHRAN, WHY

979
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:03,981
THE TARGET IS ON EDDIE.

980
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,108
>> I DON'T THINK HE WAS

981
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:05,900
ANYBODY'S FIRST CHOICE.

982
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:06,984
>> Jeff: WHO WAS THE FIRST

983
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:07,235
CHOICE?

984
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,778
>> PROBABLY REYNOLD.

985
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,863
HE'S THE SORT OF GUY WHO CAN

986
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,073
CHARM HIS WAY TO THE TOP.

987
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,991
HE WON IMMUNITY SO I THINK

988
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,159
EVERYBODY VIEWS HIM AS A HUGE,

989
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,619
HUGE THREAT.

990
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:17,954
>> Jeff: PHILLIP, ON THE OTHER

991
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,163
SIDE OF TODAY'S CHALLENGE YOU

992
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:19,497
MADE HISTORY.

993
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,250
I CAN'T THINK OF A TIME SOMEONE

994
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:27,088
HAS VOLUNTEERED TO STAY OUT OF A

995
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,382
CHALLENGE WHEN NOT TEMPTED BY

996
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:29,590
FOOD.

997
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,258
>> WHEN I WAS A SMALL BOY, I

998
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,176
WENT SWIMMING WITH A GROUP OF

999
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,345
KIDS AND I GOT TRAPPED UNDER THE

1000
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:34,554
DECK.

1001
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,890
I GOT DISORIENTED, AND

1002
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,016
FORTUNATELY FOR ME THE OWNER

1003
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,268
FOUND ME AND PULLED ME UP OUT OF

1004
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,269
THE WATER.

1005
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,353
THAT'S SOMETHING I'VE ALWAYS

1006
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,105
BEEN FEARFUL OF.

1007
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,189
FOR ME, THAT IS THE DECISION I

1008
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,065
WOULD HAVE MADE AGAIN AND AGAIN.

1009
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,150
>> Jeff: FAIR ENOUGH.

1010
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,026
ANDREA, HOW IS CAMP LIFE?

1011
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,863
>> YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF

1012
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,156
PARANOIA, TO THE POINT WHERE WE

1013
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,742
DON'T TALK TO REYNOLDS, EDDIE,

1014
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,035
AND MALCOLM, WHICH IS REALLY

1015
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,370
STRESSFUL BECAUSE I WAS ON GOTA

1016
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,413
WITH THEM AND REALLY ENJOYED

1017
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:01,080
THEIR COMPANY BUT IT MADE A LOT

1018
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,124
OF PEOPLE PARANOID ABOUT ME AND

1019
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,125
I THINK I WAS EVEN A TARGET AT

1020
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,251
ONE POINT.

1021
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,003
>> Jeff: MALCOLM, IS THERE

1022
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:07,253
TENSION?

1023
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,839
>> YEAH, MYSELF, EDDIE, AND

1024
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:10,339
REYNOLD ARE ON THE OUTS.

1025
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,842
WE'RE KIND OF LIKE WE HAVE THE

1026
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:13,301
PLAGUE OR SOMETHING.

1027
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,302
BUT THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A

1028
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,721
GAME, SO WE FIGURED WE'D DO

1029
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:17,680
SOMETHING ABOUT IT, AND TONIGHT

1030
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,182
WE'RE GOING TO TRY.

1031
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,726
THIS IS THE OTHER IMMUNITY IDOL

1032
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,352
I'VE BEEN HANGING ON TO, I'M

1033
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:27,648
GIVING IT TO EDDIE.

1034
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,191
YEAH, I HAD THAT ONE FOR A

1035
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,567
WHILE.

1036
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,235
I JUST FOUND THE OTHER ONE

1037
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:34,197
TODAY.

1038
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,239
>> Jeff: SO JUST TO BE CLEAR

1039
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,074
HOLD TIGHT.

1040
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:40,286
THE LOOKS ON FACES.

1041
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:44,624
ANDREA CAN'T EVEN LOOK UP.

1042
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,751
MALCOLM, THIS IS RARE WHEN

1043
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,669
TRIBAL GETS THIS CRAZY.

1044
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,254
ARE YOU AWARE THAT DAWN AND

1045
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,297
BRENDA ARE TALKING.

1046
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,008
COCHRAN AND ERIK ARE WHISPERING.

1047
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:55,343
ANDREA HAS HER HAND IF HER FACE.

1048
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,636
WHAT A SHIFT.

1049
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,678
>> THAT WAS THE IDEA.

1050
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,096
THAT WAS--

1051
00:34:59,180 --> 00:34:59,931
( LAUGHTER )

1052
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:02,350
PEOPLE ARE STILL WHISPERING.

1053
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:05,186
THERE MUST BE PARANOIA RIGHT NOW

1054
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,395
FROM EVERYONE GOING ARE THEY

1055
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:06,771
SAYING MY NAME?

1056
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,023
>> EXCEPT THE THREE AMIGOS.

1057
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:10,650
FOR ONCE.

1058
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,652
>> Jeff: SO, MALCOLM, I KEEP

1059
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:13,027
INTERRUPTING YOU--

1060
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,612
>> IT'S OKAY.

1061
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,823
>> Jeff: THEY'RE STILL

1062
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:17,031
TALKING.

1063
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:19,700
I FEEL LIKE I WANT AN INDIVIDUAL

1064
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,868
PAUSE BUTTON AND WANT TO HIT

1065
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,703
PAUSE FOR THE OTHER NINE.

1066
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,330
>> I KNOW FOR ONE VOTE WE HAVE

1067
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:24,539
CONTROL.

1068
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,666
ONE OF THE SEVEN OF THIS VERY

1069
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:27,959
TIGHT GROUP ARE GOING HOME.

1070
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,085
>> Jeff: DAWN, YOU WERE IN

1071
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,586
CONTROL OF THIS GAME LIKE 20

1072
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:30,920
SUCCESS OKAY.

1073
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,338
>> HONESTLY, I'M THE FAINTINGY

1074
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:35,132
SHEEP IN THIS GAME, PEOPLE

1075
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,301
SAYING THINGS AND I GO, BOOM, IS

1076
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:37,718
IT AND FALL OVER.

1077
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,303
EVERY DAY THE GAME CHANGES FOR

1078
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:39,470
ME.

1079
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,682
>> Jeff: MALCOLM, YOU WERE

1080
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:42,890
SAYING?

1081
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,434
>> WHERE WAS?

1082
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,769
OH, YEAH, WE'RE GOING HOME.

1083
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:47,937
WE'RE GOING TO BE SAFE TONIGHT

1084
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,896
BUT TOMORROW MORNING THE

1085
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,064
SITUATION HAS NOT REALLY

1086
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:50,273
CHANGED.

1087
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,357
WE'RE GOING TO BE DOWN 6-3.

1088
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,441
WE UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT WE'LL

1089
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,276
THROW IT OUT THERE, THE THREE OF

1090
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,779
US ARE VOTING FOR PHILLIP.

1091
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:57,947
I DON'T NEED TO GO DOWN A LIST

1092
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:58,990
OF REASONES YES.

1093
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,825
EVERYONE KNOWS IN THEIR HEADS.

1094
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:01,409
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A GAME,

1095
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:05,788
AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FUN.

1096
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:09,083
BUT IT'S NOT FUN ANYMORE I CAME

1097
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:10,376
OUT HERE TO HAVE THE TIME OF MY

1098
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:10,585
LIFE.

1099
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,210
>> Jeff: YOU'RE SAYING FILL

1100
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:11,377
IEP.

1101
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,255
>> PHILLIP IS THE FUN SPONGE.

1102
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,965
HE SUCKS IT ALL OUT OF THE

1103
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:16,173
GROUP.

1104
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,216
IT'S A GAME BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE

1105
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,220
TO BE A MILITARISTIC THING WHERE

1106
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,181
WE'RE ALL IN BASIC TRAINING.

1107
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,515
>> THAT IS NOT HOW I PLAY THE

1108
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:24,724
GAME.

1109
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,392
HE IS TRYING TO LABEL ME AS

1110
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,102
SOMETHING I'M NOT.

1111
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:29,937
>> Jeff: WOW, SO, WHERE ARE

1112
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:30,104
WE?

1113
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:31,522
ANDREA, I'M GUESSING YOUR BEST

1114
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,524
BET RIGHT NOW IS TO SAY, SURE,

1115
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,108
PHILLIP, ABSOLUTELY PHILLIP.

1116
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,236
I KNOW MAO TO SPELL IT, TWO

1117
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,615
"Ls" AND WOON "P."

1118
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,284
>> IT'S TRUE, HE HAS A THE LOVE

1119
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:43,743
CONSERVATION AT ONCE.

1120
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:46,162
I WAS ONCE A TARGET SO, I'M

1121
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:46,746
STILL VERY PARANOID.

1122
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,247
>> Jeff: IS THAT A BIG PART OF

1123
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:48,581
THIS, ANDREA?

1124
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:49,415
WHAT IS IT THIS IS A DOUBLE PLAY

1125
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,792
AND THIS IS NOT WHAT'S GOING TO

1126
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:52,001
HAPPEN?

1127
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:52,293
>> EXACTLY.

1128
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,754
I MEAN, I'M VERY SCARED.

1129
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,130
>> I CAN SAY SOMETHING?

1130
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:56,505
>> Jeff: YEAH.

1131
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,424
>> YES, ALL THREE OF THEM ARE

1132
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,176
LIKE, WE'RE THE THREE AMIGOS,

1133
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,469
THESE ARE OUR IDOLS, WE'RE GOING

1134
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,221
TO PLAY THEM.

1135
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,430
BUT THERE IS SOME BONUS IN

1136
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:05,389
KEEPING ONE IDOL.

1137
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,850
IF ONE PERSON DECIDES NOT TO

1138
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:08,726
PLAY IT.

1139
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,437
>> Jeff: PHILLIP, YET A NEW

1140
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:11,646
WRINKLE.

1141
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,065
THE FACT THAT THEY'RE WEARING

1142
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:14,690
THEM MEANS NOTHING.

1143
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,317
THEY NEED TO GIVE THEM TO US.

1144
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,527
>> I THINK WE SHOULD VOTE THE

1145
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,822
WAY WE SAID WE WOULD VOTE WHEN

1146
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:22,365
WE CAME IN HERE.

1147
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:26,827
FIHAVE TO GO HOME, I HAVE TO GO

1148
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:27,036
HOME.

1149
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,496
BUT I'D RATHER DO IT

1150
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,791
STRATEGICALLY THAN MALIGN MY

1151
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:32,041
CHARACTER.

1152
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:32,833
>> Jeff: COCHRAN, YOU HAVE

1153
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,670
WRITTEN PAPERS ABOUT SURVIVOR

1154
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,880
>> I'M HAVING A BIPOLAR

1155
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:38,172
REACTION.

1156
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:39,423
BECAUSE THE "SURVIVOR" FAN IS

1157
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:42,301
SITTING HOME SAYING THIS IS THE

1158
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,095
MOST EXCITING FREAKING TRIBAL

1159
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,389
COUNCIL I HAVE EVER SEEN.

1160
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,975
PEOPLE ARE WHISPERING, AND

1161
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,393
VOTING IS CHANGE CHICAGO IS

1162
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,186
EXTREMELY RARE AT TRIBAL COUNCIL

1163
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:53,437
SO THIS IS GOING TO BE A GAMBLE.

1164
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,398
>> Jeff: WHAT IS IT IT IS

1165
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,315
ABOUT TAKING OUT ONE OF THE

1166
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,401
OTHER SIX AND THEY'RE SHOVING

1167
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,319
EVERYTHING TOWARDS PHILLIPS IS A

1168
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:00,569
MISDIRECT.

1169
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,071
>> I THINK IT JUST TAKES A

1170
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,864
COUPLE US TO VOTE AND TAKE

1171
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:04,865
SOMEONE OUT THAT'S IN THE

1172
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:08,119
ALLIANCE THAT'S NOT PHILLIP.

1173
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,120
>> Jeff: SO THE QUESTIONS AS

1174
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:09,704
WE GO TO THE VOTE ARE WHO ARE

1175
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,414
THE THREE AMIGOS GOING TO VOTE

1176
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:11,580
FOR?

1177
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,416
WHO ARE THE SEVEN GOING TO VOTE

1178
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:13,582
FOR?

1179
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,668
AND ARE EDDIE AND MALCOLM GOING

1180
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:18,421
TO PLAY THEIR INDIVIDUAL

1181
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:19,130
IMMUNITY IDOLS?

1182
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,340
ALL RIGHT, ONE OF THE CRAZIEST

1183
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:21,841
TRIBALS EVER.

1184
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,134
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1185
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:39,608
PHILLIP, YOU'RE UP.

1186
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,201
>> WHATEVER HAPPENS TONIGHT,

1187
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:52,246
THIS IS WHY I FREAKING LOVE

1188
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:52,788
"SURVIVOR" AND HAVE FOR 13

1189
00:38:52,872 --> 00:39:09,722
YEARS.

1190
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,227
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1191
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,729
VOTES.

1192
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,489
IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN

1193
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:27,323
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO

1194
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:28,824
PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME

1195
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,535
TO DO SO.

1196
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,936
>> Jeff: EDDIE AND MALCOLM

1197
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,687
BOTH PLAYED THEIR IDOLS.

1198
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,815
ANY VOTE CAST FOR EDDIEO MALCOLM

1199
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,066
WILL NOT COUNT.

1200
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:07,488
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1201
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,073
FIRST VOTE, MALCOLM.

1202
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,658
DOES NOT COUNT.

1203
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:10,866
MALCOLM.

1204
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:15,704
DOES NOT COUNT.

1205
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:15,913
EDDIE.

1206
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:20,126
DOES NOT COUNT.

1207
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:20,334
EDDIE.

1208
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:23,212
DOES NOT COUNT.

1209
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:23,420
EDDIE.

1210
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:26,340
DOES NOT COUNT.

1211
00:40:26,423 --> 00:40:26,507
EDDIE.

1212
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:32,429
DOES NOT COUNT.

1213
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:32,972
PHILLIP.

1214
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:37,184
ONE VOTE PHILLIP.

1215
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:43,315
TWO VOTES PHILLIP.

1216
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,526
11th PERSON VOTED OUT AND

1217
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,444
THE SECOND MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

1218
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:47,695
PHILLIP.

1219
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:48,028
THAT'S THREE.

1220
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,530
THAT'S ENOUGH.

1221
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:57,413
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1222
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:58,831
PHILLIP, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1223
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:08,299
>> THANK YOU.

1224
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:15,264
>> Jeff: WELL, IN ONE OF THE

1225
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,975
CRAZIEST TRIBALS EVER, REYNOLD,

1226
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:19,185
EDDIE, AND MALCOLM SURVIVE

1227
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:19,518
ANOTHER VOTE.

1228
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,228
THE QUESTION IS DID THEY CHANGE

1229
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,063
THE GAME ENOUGH TO SURVIVE

1230
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:23,647
ANOTHER VOTE?

1231
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,108
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

1232
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,234
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1233
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,319

"SURVIVOR"

1243

1244
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:54,720
MALCOLM LOOK TO RECRUIT NEW

1245
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:54,929
ALLIES.

1249
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,769
"SURVIVOR" AUCTION?

1250
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:02,561
HOW OFTEN DOES THAT HAPPEN?

1251
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:07,816
>> MORE OFTEN THAN YOU THINK.

1252
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,654
>> I FEEL I PLAYED A GREAT GAME.

1253
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:14,240
I AM SO HAPPY WITH THE WAY I

1254
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:14,448
PLAYED.

1255
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:16,575
I TRIED TO BRING INTO THE GAME

1256
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:17,117
SOME THINGS I LEARNED FROM

1257
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:17,660
BOSTON ROB.

1258
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:21,705
I FELT OFTEN LIKE I CAN IN

1259
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:22,915
"SURVIVOR" SEASON 22.

1260
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:23,749
I WASN'T RESPECTED.

1261
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:24,667
I WASN'T APPRECIATED FOR THE

1262
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,794
THINGS THAT I DO.

1263
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,045
THAT PART HURTS FOR ME.

1264
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,129
I'M FEELING GOOD.

1265
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:29,964
I, I PLAYED A GREAT GAME.

1266
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:30,631
I KNOW I DID A VERY GOOD JOB OUT

1267
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:31,674
HERE AND DID MY BEST.
