193
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,357
KEITH DROPS.

194
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,860

00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:19,632
IT IS WENDY ALONE IN THE LEAD.

CHRIS AND DEVENS RIGHT ON HER
TAIL.

198
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:24,971
WENDY INCHES AWAY.

199
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:30,743
CAN SHE GET IT TO DROP?

200
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,278
WENDY DROPS.

201
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:33,746
WENDY HAS TO START AGAIN.

202
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:34,680
CHRIS NOW IN THE LEAD.

203
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,316
YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME,
BUDDY.

204
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,986
Jeff: CHRIS NOW VERY CLOSE
TO THE TOP, GETTING CLOSER AND

205
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:40,553
CLOSER.

206
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:41,754
HES GOT A STEADY HAND.

207
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:42,588
IS THIS IT?

208
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,390
YOU GOT IT.

209
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,125
Jeff: NO!

210
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,427
CHRIS DROPS.

211
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,862
INCHES AWAY FROM THE TOP.

212
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:50,530
WOW.

213
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:54,467
IT IS NOW DEVENS WITH A SHOT.

214
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,302
INCHES AWAY.

215
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:56,936
CAN HE DROP IT?

216
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:59,138
OH, MY GOSH.

217
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:02,708
STILL HOVERING.

218
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:05,177
DEVENS DOES IT!

219
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:09,682
DEVENS EARNS HIS WAY BACK INTO
THIS GAME.

220
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,184
DEVENS HAS DONE IT.

221
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,788
THAT TIME ON DISTINCTION WAS
WITH IT.

222
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:19,659
A HUGE EFFORT BY EVERYBODY AS
THE TEARS START TO FLOW FOR

223
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,628
EVERYONE.

224
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:23,963
IM REALLY SORRY.

225
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:28,968
THATS OKAY, DUDE.

226
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:32,138
Jeff: DEVENS, YOU
ACCOMPLISHED THE GOAL OF

227
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:35,575
DISTINCTION, WHICH IS THEY THERE
LONG ENOUGH TO GET A SHOT AND

228
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:36,642
THEN MAKE IT PAY OFF.

229
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,945
YOU ARE BACK IN THIS GAME.

230
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,379
CONGRATULATIONS.

231
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,581
[APPLAUSE]
 DEVENS!

232
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,149
Jeff: JOIN YOUR NEW MERGED
TRIBE.

233
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,450
OH, GOD.

234
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,986
CONGRATS, RICK.

235
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,154
IM LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS.

236
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,222
Jeff: DEVENS HAS A FRESH
START IN THIS GAME, BUT THATS

237
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,991
ALL YOU HAVE.

238
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:55,595
AND NOW DISTINCTION BEGINS
AGAIN.

239
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,064
OH, BOY.

240
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:03,235
Jeff: EVERY PERSON VOTED
OUT WILL HAVE THE SAME

241
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:03,569
OPPORTUNITY.

242
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,704
ALL RIGHT.

243
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:09,675
YOU ARE MERGING THE MANU BEACH,
WHERE YOUR FEAST AWAITS.

244
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:16,248
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD OUT, COME
UP WITH A NEW TRIBE NAME.

245
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:21,320
BEFORE EDGE OF EXTINCTION THE
GAME IN A LOT OF WAYS WAS

246
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:27,593
GETTING THE BEST OF ME, BUT IF I
CAN WIN MY WAY BACK INTO THE

247
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,761
GAME, I CAN WIN CHALLENGES.

248
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:34,467
IM A WHOLE NEW MAN THANKS TO
THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION.

249
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,837
Jeff: AUBRY, THATS THE
MOMENT YOU HOPE FOR.

250
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,940
THATS WHAT KEPT YOU GOING.

251
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:45,144
"SURVIVOR" HAS JUST GIVEN ME
SO MUCH IN MY LIFE, AND I OWE SO

252
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:49,215
MUCH TO THIS GAME, AND IM
GRATEFUL, BUT I GOT PLAYED, AND

253
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,850
I GOT PLAYED HARD.

254
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:54,086
IM PROUD TO STAND WITH THESE
GUYS, AND IM JUST GRATEFUL TO

255
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,622
YOU, JEFF, AND EVERYONE HERE,
BECAUSE I DONT THINK I WOULD

256
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,124
HAVE GROWN UP WITHOUT
"SURVIVOR."

257
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:03,996
Jeff: REEM, WHY ARE YOU OUT
HERE?

258
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:08,768
DUDE, LIKE IVE BEEN WATCHING
THIS FOR 18 YEARS.

259
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,069
ITS MY FAVORITE SHOW.

260
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:11,771
THIS IS NO TALKING, DONT CALL
ME.

261
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,907
THIS IS THE KIDS, COME AND
WATCH, THIS ITS FAMILY TIME.

262
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,043
THIS IS THE DREAM.

263
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:20,579
AND I GET VOTED OUT, AND THEN I
END UP IN HELL, MAN.

264
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:21,914
LIKE IT SUCKED.

265
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:24,483
BUT I COULDNT RAISE THAT MAST.

266
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,218
IM PROUD OF MYSELF.

267
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:31,691
Jeff: KEITH, HOW DO YOU GET
THROUGH DISTINCTION?

268
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:32,758
-- EXTINCTION IN.

269
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,327
THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION, YOU
LIVE MOMENT BY MOMENT.

270
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:39,065
YOU TAKE IT STEP BY STEP, AND
THAT PAST BECOMES EVERYTHING

271
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:39,899
THAT YOU WANT.

272
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:41,767
IT BECOMES THE FOOD THAT YOU
WANT.

273
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:42,868
IT BECOMES A BED.

274
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:46,439
IM SO PROUD THAT I DID NOT GIVE
UP.

275
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,641
Jeff: WENDY, WHAT ARE YOU
FEELING RIGHT NOW?

276
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,042
YOURE FRESHLY OUT OF THE GAME?

277
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:53,779
YEAH, I FEEL KIND OF BAD THAT
I DIDNT SPEND AS LONG AS THESE

278
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,614
PEOPLE ON EXTINCTION.

279
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:59,552
I WENT, HAD A NICE REST, AND I
WAS BACK IN THE GAME, BUT ALL OF

280
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,221
YOU KHWEIS SHOULD BE SO PROUD
THAT THE SECOND YOU TOUCHED THE

281
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,691
SAND ON THE BEACH, YOU GUYS ARE
WINNERS, YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY,

282
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:10,429
NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE.

283
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:13,666
Jeff: CHRIS, WHAT WAS THE
LOWEST POINT FOR YOU ON

284
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:14,767
EXTINCTION?

285
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,570
WHEN I CAME OUT HERE, I
WANTED TO PLAY THIS PERFECT

286
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:20,606
GAME, AND TO HAVE THAT SLIP
THREW MY HANDS, AND HAVING TO

287
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,442
EMBRACE THAT AND UNDERSTAND,
LIKE, YOU CANT BE PERFECT,

288
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,212
YOURE GOING TO SCREW UP.

289
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,248
BUT BEING OUT THERE WITH THESE
GUYS, YOU HAVE TO PUT ON A FACE.

290
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,816
YOU DIDNT HAVE TO FAKE
ANYTHING.

291
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:36,756
YOU COULD JUST BE YOURSELF, AND
IT WAS LIKE THERAPY FOR ME.

292
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,290
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

293
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:43,796
REEM, KEITH, CHRIS, AUBRY,
WENDY, YOU HAVE ANOTHER DECISION

294
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,197
TO MAKE.

295
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:49,001
OH, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.

296
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,470
Jeff: WHO WANTS TO GO BACK
THE DISTINCTION ISLAND FOR

297
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:52,705
ANOTHER SHOT BACK IN THIS GAME?

298
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:56,542
LETS DO IT!

299
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:57,777
Jeff: EVERYBODY GOING BACK.

300
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,679
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
THE BOAT.

301
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:01,747
YOUR ADVENTURE CONTINUES.

302
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,049
WERE BACK, WERE BACK, WERE
BACK.

303
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:08,087
WHEN YOU THINK YOUVE GONE
LOW ON "SURVIVOR," IT CAN GO SO

304
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,756
MUCH LOWER, THE LOWER YOU GO,
THE HIGHER THE HIGHS.

305
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,893
WHEN JEFF SAID THAT WE COULD
COME BACK, I WAS JUMPING UP AND

306
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:17,963
DOWN LIKE A CHILD ON CHRISTMAS
MORNING.

307
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:18,664
WERE STILL IN.

308
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:19,698
IM NOT OUT OF IT.

309
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,734
I AM STILL PLAYING "SURVIVOR."

310
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,679
OH, MY GOD.

311
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:38,117
YOU LOOK SO GOOD.

312
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:43,322
WE ARRIVED AT THE MERGE, AND
I HAVE THIS OVERWHELMING FEELING

313
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,591
OF EXCITEMENT AND JOY.

314
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:50,029
WE ARE GOING INTO THIS WITH ALL
OF THE KAMA MEMBERS BACK

315
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,765
TOGETHER SOME WE HAVE EIGHT
PEOPLE IF WE CAN STICK TOGETHER.

316
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:55,100
WERE GOING TO HAVE THE
MAJORITY.

317
00:13:55,134 --> 00:14:00,005
THATS AN INCREDIBLE FEELING.

318
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:03,475
HOW WAS DISTINCTION ISLAND?

319
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,277
ITS PURGATORY.

320
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,279
THE TWIST IS RIGHT ON YOUR BUFF.

321
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,683
YOU GET A TORCH, THERES MAP,
AND THERES A BOAT AND A

322
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:11,917
SHIPWRECK.

323
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:16,455
OF ALL THE FACES THAT I SAW
DOING THAT CHALLENGE, DEVENS WAS

324
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:23,562
THE ONE PERSON I THOUGHT, OH,
HELL NO.

325
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,664
LIKE WHY ARE YOU BACK HERE NOW?

326
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:30,803
I DONT WANT HIM BACK HERE.

327
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:35,307
HOW ARE YOU WITH THE DAD BOD
IN.

328
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,142
DAD BOD IS BACK IN THE GAME.

329
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,777
IM BACK, BABY.

330
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:39,979
IM BACK IN THE GAME.

331
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,314
BUT THERE IS DEFINITELY A FEAR
THAT YOU WILL BE THE EASY VOTE

332
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:43,916
OUT BECAUSE YOU JUST CAME BACK
IN.

333
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,417
MAYBE THEY RESENT IT.

334
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:46,552
MAYBE ITS JUST EASY.

335
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:49,588
SO I NEED TO MAKE A HUMAN
CONNECTION REAL EARLY SO THEY

336
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:53,659
DONT WRITE ME OFF AS THE EASY
VOTE BACK TO EDGE OF EXTINCTION

337
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:54,894
BEFORE THEY GET TO KNOW ME.

338
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:59,531
I DONT KNOW HOW YOU FEEL IN
TERMS OF YOUR OLD TRIBE, BUT I

339
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,167
DIDNT KNOW --
 THEY VOTED ME OFF.

340
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:05,871
SO AS MUCH AS I LOVE THEM, IM A
FREE AGENT RIGHT NOW.

341
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,775
THE MINUTE I START SPEAKING
TO RICK AT THE MERGE FEAST, I

342
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:13,679
KNEW THAT I REALLY LIKED HIM,
AND I FELL LIKE HE WAS A GENUINE

343
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:16,749
PERSON, JUST THE FACT THAT HE
HAD THAT BIG HERO MOMENT AND WAS

344
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:20,386
ABLE TO WIN A SPOT BACK INTO
THIS GAME, LIKE IM ROOTING FOR

345
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,620
HIM.

346
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:25,391
I WOULD NEVER WANT TO SEE HIM GO
BACK TO THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION

347
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,592
SO QUICKLY.

348
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,695
I MEAN, IT SOUNDS LIKE A SCARY
PLACE THAT I NEVER WANT TO GO

349
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:39,772
TO.

350
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:45,611
TO.

351
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:48,480
I NEW THAT COMING BAN WAS
GOING TO BE HARD, BUT ITS WHAT

352
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:54,320
I NEEDED.

353
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:57,089
OTHER PEOPLE, THOUGH, WE GET
BACK TO THIS ISLAND AND ITS

354
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:57,856
BUYERS REMORSE.

355
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,225
THEIR JOURNEY IS OUT OF THIS
GAME.

356
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:05,931
AFTER I LOST, I HONESTLY FELT
DOWN AGAIN, AND THEN IT HIT ME,

357
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:11,403
IF I GET OFF THIS ISLAND RIGHT
NOW, IVE GOTTEN MORE THAN WHAT

358
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,571
I EVER CAME WITH.

359
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:13,906
AND THEN THERE WAS THREE.

360
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:15,107
THEN THERE WAS THREE.

361
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,745
I DONT THINK ANYONE HAS HAD
AN EXPERIENCE LIKE I HAVE.

362
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:23,382
EVERYTHING THAT COULD HAVE GONE
WRONG DID GO WRONG, BUT AT THE

363
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:27,052
END OF THE DAY, I FEEL SO PROUD
OF MYSELF, AND THATS WHATS

364
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,454
MOST IMPORTANT FOR ME.

365
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,589
HOW CRAZY.

366
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,458
THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION WILL
ONLY HEAT UP.

367
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,995
THE WEAK ARENT GOING TO
SURVIVE, BUT WHEN EVERYONE IS

368
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:39,231
CRUMBLING AROUND ME, I KNOW JUST
WHAT TO DO, AND I HAVE A GOAL.

369
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:43,268
IM GOING TO GET MY BUTT BACK IN
THIS GAME.

370
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,053
 HE JUST CAME BACK.

371
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:01,687
UH-HUH.

372
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,122
IM WORKING WITH LAUREN.

373
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:04,623
WE HAVE TWO IDOLS.

374
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:05,557
THATS A LOT OF POWER.

375
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:09,862
WE CAN DO A LOT WITH THAT IF
DONE CORRECTLY.

376
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,231
WE NEED TO FIND A CRACK.

377
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:15,167
THE PROBLEM IS IM IN THIS
MINORITY GROUP.

378
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,538
IM GOING TO NEED EVERY TOOL
THAT I CAN GIVEN THE SITUATION

379
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,106
THAT IM IN.

380
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,709
SO I 1,000% HAVE TO HAVE A TALK
WITH JOE.

381
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:26,512
HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT
EVERYTHING?

382
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:31,817
I FEEL LIKE WERE... I FEEL
LIKE THIS IS SECOND CHANCE 2.0.

383
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:40,025
HERE I AM AGAIN WITH JOE
FREAKING INGLAM.

384
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,794
HERE HE IS AGAIN IN THE MAJORITY
ALINES.

385
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,962
I FEEL LIKE IM AT HIS MERCY.

386
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:44,797
WHY?

387
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,633
THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE
FOR ME.

388
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:48,934
WELL SEE HOW WELKE PITCH HIM.

389
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:50,669
THIS IS A SALES PITCH FOR ME.

390
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:53,739
I DONT KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ACT
THOSE GUYS AFTER THE AUBRY

391
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:54,239
THING.

392
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,441
I DONT LIKE IT.

393
00:17:55,474 --> 00:18:01,513
I DONT TRUST MOST OF MY KAMAS
BECAUSE ITS LIKE THEYRE ALL

394
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:06,285
TOGETHER, BUT ME AND AUBRY WERE
LIKE... AND AURORA.

395
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:07,352
AURORA WAS ON THE OUTS.

396
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:08,887
I FEEL LIKE IM ON THE BOTTOM.

397
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,255
ITS A WEIRD STATE OF LIMBO.

398
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:14,326
I DEFINITELY SEE DAVID AND
DEVON GOING TO THAT SIDE.

399
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,628
I SEE THEM SHIFTING TO THAT
GROUP.

400
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,464
THAT WILL TRY TO TAKE YOU OUT.

401
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,032
IM NOT COMING FOR YOU, JOE.

402
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,000
IM NOT COMING FOR YOU.

403
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,168
I NEED YOU HERE, TOO.

404
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:26,105
I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE JOE
WILL COME WITH ME, BUT I AM

405
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:30,943
STILL TRYING TO DECIPHER, FIGURE
OUT THIS KAMA TRIBE.

406
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:35,914
SO I THINK THE BEST PLAN IS TO
MAKE IT AN EASY VOTE, TO TAKE

407
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,984
OUT RICK.

408
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:41,320
SO NOW WE HAVE ALL THE GIRLS.

409
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:44,356
WHAT IS THIS SIX GIRL, SEVEN
GUYS?

410
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:45,057
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

411
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:45,891
WHATS THE IDEAL?

412
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:49,394
IM OPEN TO HEARING ALL
SUGGESTIONS.

413
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:52,464
WE WANT TO GET THROUGH A SAFE
VOTE.

414
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:55,567
AND RICKS NAME KIND OF POPPED
UP.

415
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:58,103
HE COULD BE AN EASY VOTE THAT
EVERYONE COULD GET ON BOARD

416
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:58,871
WITH.

417
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,005
THAT DOESNT CROSS TOO MANY
LINES.

418
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:05,144
I AM SHOCKED KELLEY AND
LAUREN WANT TO VOTE DEVENS OFF

419
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:07,880
FIRST AND SEND HIM RIGHT BACK TO
THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION.

420
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,716
JUST FROM A MORAL STANDPOINT,
LIKE I DONT SEE HOW YOU COULD

421
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:13,752
POSSIBLY DO THAT TO SOMEBODY TO
SEND THEM RIGHT BACK TO WHERE

422
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,854
THEY CAME AFTER FACING THE ODDS.

423
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,690
I DONT THINK RICKS BAD
IDEA.

424
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:24,396
I DONT THINK IT PISSES ANYONE
OFF.

425
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:29,668
I THINK WE GET RID OF DEVENS,
TELL ME DEVENS OR DAVID.

426
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:30,502
ILL DO IT.

427
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,138
KELLEY AND LAUREN SEEM SO
BRUTAL.

428
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:38,310
MAYBE ONE OF THEM SHOULD BE SENT
HER MERRY WAY OFF TO THE EDGE OF

429
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,112
EXTINCTION.

430
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:52,057
THATS A LOT OF PIECES THAT
WE CAN PLAY WITH.

431
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,992
THATS GOOD RIGHT THERE.

432
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,129
YOU GUYS NEED A HAND?

433
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:00,065
NOT REALLY.

434
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:04,570
WHEN I GOT BACK TO CAMP, I
OPENED MY BAG, AND THERE IS A IT

435
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,271
LITTLE SOMETHING THERE.

436
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:11,543
IM TRYING TO KEEP A STRAIGHT
FACE.

437
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,213
BECAUSE I KNOW I GOT TO GET AWAY
FROM EVERYONE AND FIND OUT WHAT

438
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:18,784
IS SITTING IN MY BAG.

439
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:22,688
AND SO I PRACTICALLY RUN DOWN
THE PATH, AND I GET DOWN THE

440
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:29,861
TRAIL, I UNWRAP IT, AND... HOLY
CRAP.

441
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,563
AND ITS THIS BEAUTY.

442
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:36,101
TWO PIECES WITH A NOTE.

443
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:36,868
"CONGRATULATIONS.

444
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,271
YOU HAVE EARNED YOUR WAY BACK
IN.

445
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:40,806
STAYING IN MAY NOT BE AS EASY.

446
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:43,909
THIS MAY HELP."

447
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:47,112
YOU MUST GIVE ONE HALF OF THIS
IMMUNITY IDOL TO ANOTHER PLAYER.

448
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,881
IF YOURE BOTH STILL IN THE GAME
AFTER THE NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL,

449
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:54,019
THESE TWO PIECES WHEN USED
TOGETHER BECOME ONE IDOL WITH

450
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,654
FULL POWER.

451
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,289
SO ITS AN IMMUNITY IDOL.

452
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:58,490
I CANT USE IT THIS TIME.

453
00:20:58,523 --> 00:20:59,625
I KEEP HALF OF IT.

454
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:02,361
I GIVE THE OTHER HALF TO ANOTHER
PLAYER IN THE GAME.

455
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:05,797
THIS MAY BE THE ONLY BAR
DWAYNEING CHIP YOU HAVE TO STAY

456
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:06,965
IN THE GAME.

457
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:13,071
THIS IDOL HAS NO POWER UNTIL
AFTER THE NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

458
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,106
HOLY CRAP.

459
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,308
BUT ITS TRICKY BECAUSE I CANT
USE IT THIS TIME.

460
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:29,788
SO I HAVE TO DO WHAT I HAVE TO
DO TO GET PAST THIS FIRST VOTE.

461
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,323
I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL.

462
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:32,791
I HAVE AN IMMUNITY IDOL.

463
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,092
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

464
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,896
YEAH, BUT I HAVE TO
HALF OF IT TO SOMEONE ELSE.

465
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:38,597
OKAY.

466
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,531
BEFORE THE TRIBAL.

467
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,199
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

468
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,367
YEAH.

469
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,970
DAVIDS THE ONE I CAN TRUST
MOST, SO HES THE ONE I FEEL

470
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:48,006
LIKE IF I HAVE TO WORK THIS IDOL
WITH SOMEONE ELSE, IM GOING TO

471
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,909
SHARE IT WITH MY CLOSEST ALLY.

472
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,979
SO OBVIOUSLY IM PLANNING ON
GIVING YOU THE OTHER HALF.

473
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:57,115
IF EITHER OF US GETS VOTED OUT,
WERE DONE.

474
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,986
FOR THE FIRST VOTE, ITS NOT
AN IMMUNITY ILL DOLL.

475
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,654
ITS JUST A BARGAINING CHIP.

476
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:04,656
I FEEL LIKE I MIGHT BE ON THE
BOTTOM.

477
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:14,733
SO IM SCARED TO DEATH GOING
INTO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

478
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:22,107
SO IM SCARED TO DEATH GOING
INTO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

479
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,911
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

480
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,318
ALL RIGHT.

481
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,888
LETS GET TO YOUR FIRST
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

482
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:39,057
FIRST THINGS FIRST, RON.

483
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,026

IMMUNITY.

484
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:44,162
THANK YOU.

485
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,398
TRIBAL IMMUNITY NO MORE.

486
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:49,801
THIS IS NOW WHAT YOU COVET.

487
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,536
THE INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
NECKLACE.

488
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,839
LETS GET TO IT.

489
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:57,275
FOR TODAYS CHALLENGE, YOURE
GOING TO STAND ON NARROW BEAM

490
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:00,746
WHILE BALANCING A STATUE AT
REGULAR INTERVALS.

491
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:04,282
YOULL MOVE FURTHER DOWN THE
BEAM, MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT.

492
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:08,086
IF AT ANY POINT YOU FALL OFF THE
BEAM OR YOUR STATUE DROPS,

493
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,287
YOURE OUT.

494
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:12,657
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS
IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE VOTE.

495
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,160
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE SEVENTH

496
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,729
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

497
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:18,730
TAKE YOUR SPOTS.

498
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,265
WELL GET STARTED.

GOOD LUCK.

500
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:26,838
ALL RIGHT.

501
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,173
EVERYBODY LOOKS GOOD.

502
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:33,478

IMMEDIATELY A HUGE GUST OF WIND

503
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,781

RON IS FIRST TO DROP.

505
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,651
RON IS OUT.

506
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:43,088
YOUR FIRST INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.

507
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:46,758
13 PEOPLE IN THE GAME.

508
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,293
DEVENS EARNED HIS WAY BACK IN.

509
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:51,830
COULD HE PULL IT OFF RIGHT HERE?

510
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:53,465
LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT.

511
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:58,036
FROM VICTORIA NOW.

512
00:23:58,069 --> 00:23:59,171
GAVIN DROPS.

513
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:01,406
GAVIN THE SECOND PERSON OUT.

514
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,846
WE ARE DOWN TO 11.

515
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:08,780
ALL RIGHT.

516
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:12,317
IT IS TIME NOW TO MOVE FURTHER
DOWN THE BEAM.

517
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,152
ITS MORE NARROW, MORE
DIFFICULT.

518
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,020
START MAKING YOUR MOVE.

519
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:17,689
THIS IS A LIVE TRANSITION.

520
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:23,895
SO IF YOU DROP HERE, YOU ARE
OUT.

521
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:25,497
WARDOG CANT MAKE THE
TRANSITION.

522
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,699
WARDOG IS OUT.

523
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:31,369
EVERYBODY ELSE HAS SUCCESSFULLY
MADE THE TRANSITION.

524
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,972
AND THIS CHALLENGE CONTINUES.

525
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:38,810
YOULL BE IN THIS SECTION FOR

526
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:43,215
JUST LIKE THAT WITH ABSOLUTELY
NO MOVEMENT DEVENS IS OUT.

527
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,382
HIS STATUE DROPS.

528
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,751
NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.

529
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:50,422

MORE WIND.

533
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:01,700
AURORA DROPS.

534
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:04,503
AURORA IS OUT.

535
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,071
SIX HAVE ALREADY DROPPED.

536
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:11,610
SEVEN STILL FIGHTING.

537
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,345

WOBBLE.

543
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:42,774
WITNESS AGAIN THAT WIND PICKING
UP, WHIPPING THROUGH THIS FIELD.

544
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:48,013
MY ARMS ARE NUMB.

545
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,849
THERES A BUG ON MY LEG.

546
00:25:50,882 --> 00:26:00,825

IM SORRY.

550
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,666
Jeff: WENTWORTH CANNOT TAKE

551
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:08,466
SHE DROPS.

552
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,200

AND LAUREN.

00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:22,147
WERE 20 MINUTES INTO THIS
CHALLENGE.

556
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,183
IT IS TIME THE MOVE INTO THE
MOST NARROW PART OF THE BEAM.

557
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:30,055
YOU HAVE TO MOVE ALL THE WAY
DOWN TO THE END AND GET TOES IN

558
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:30,855

559
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:31,923
START MAKING YOU MOVE.

560
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:34,926

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,161
SLOW AND EASY.

562
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:37,996
NO NEED TO RACE.

563
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,297
ERIC CANT MAKE THE TRANSITION.

564
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:39,965
ERIC IS OUT.

565
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,367

566
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,635

568
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:45,203

EVERYBODY IS GOOD.

572
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:58,416
THAT TRANSITION GOT A LOT OF
PEOPLE.

573
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:11,696
JULIE, JOE, AND LAUREN ALL STILL
FIGHTING FOR IMMUNITY.

574
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,099
BEEN UP THERE 40 MINUTES.

575
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,168
THIS IS NOT EASY.

576
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:24,309
JULIE HAS BEEN VERY STEADY THIS
ENTIRE CHALLENGE.

577
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:26,778
JULIE, YOURE HOT.

578
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,413
ILL TAKE IT.

579
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:29,547
SHES BUFF.

580
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:35,687
Jeff: JOE HAS BEEN VERY
STEADY.

581
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:43,161
LAUREN REALLY HAS THE FRONT OF
HER POLE DIPPING DOWN NOW.

582
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:44,596
JOE DROPS OUT OF NOWHERE.

583
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,798
HE HAD BEEN ROCK STEADY.

584
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,667

585
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,669

00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:54,506
HERE COMES THE WIND NOW MAKING

587
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:55,907
LAUREN MOVING ALL OVER.

588
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,610
THAT STATUE HOLDING FIRM.

589
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:01,946
THAT WIND NO JOKE.

590
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,517
REALLY BLOWING.

591
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,317

00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:16,227
Jeff: ANOTHER GUST OF WIND.

593
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:17,262
CRAP.

594
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:20,298
Jeff: LAUREN DROPS.

595
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:27,505

597
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:28,239
WOW.

598
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:30,141
THAT WAS SUDDEN.

599
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,077
LAUREN, GREAT JOB.

600
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,978
GREAT JOB, LADY.

601
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:37,215
YOU GIRLS ARE STRONG.

602
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:48,393
Jeff: JULIE, COME ON OVER.

00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:50,328
JULIE, FIRST INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY

604
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:51,963
SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

605
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:54,799
IF YOU CAN EXPRESS WHAT IT MEANS
THE MAKE HIT THE LONG AND WIN,

606
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,000
WHAT IS IT?

607
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:59,871
I FEEL LIKE IVE BEEN WANTING
TO BE ON "SURVIVOR" FOR 18

608
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:05,076
YEARS, AND TO WIN THIS FIRST
IMMUNITY IS...

609
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,079
YEAH, JULIE.

610
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:11,082
[APPLAUSE]
 I FEEL LIKE MY KIDS AND MY

611
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:12,117
HUSBAND WILL BE SO PROUD OF ME.

612
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,252
Jeff: JULIE SAFE TONIGHT AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

613
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:17,589
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, SOMEBODY
WILL BE THE SEVENTH PERSON VOTED

614
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:18,423
OUT OF THIS GAME.

615
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:20,125
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

616
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:21,693
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

617
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:23,261
CONGRATS.

618
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:28,099
THE PLAN TO GET OUT DEVENS
TONIGHT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED WITH

619
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:31,436
EVERYONE, AND EVERYONE APPEARS
TO BE ON BOARD, BUT THERES SO

620
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:32,871
MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT IT
COULD GO.

621
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:35,840
ALL I KNOW IS THAT I HAVE A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

622
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:39,310
IM VERY EXCITED THAT I HAVE
THAT LITTLE CUSHION, BECAUSE

623
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:43,414
PLAYING "SURVIVOR" BEFORE, I
KNOW HOW CRAZY VOTING IS AFTER

624
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,451
THE MERGE, SO I MIGHT HAVE TO
BRING OUT THE BIG GUNS.

625
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,112
I WOULD HAVE BEEN SCARED TO
DEATH GOING INTO TRIBAL COUNCIL

626
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,881
TONIGHT, BUT THE FACT THAT ILL
BE WEARING THE IMMUNITY

627
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:20,685
NECKLACE, THERES NO BLINDSIDES
ON ME TONIGHT.

628
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:25,423
THATS LIKE THE MOST COMFORTABLE
FEELING I COULD HAVE.

629
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:32,130
IM DYING TO TALK TO YOU.

630
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:39,137
KELLEY AND LAUREN, WE COULD
BRING IN DAVID AND RICK AND GET

631
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:39,971
KELLEY OUT.

632
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,406
KELLEY IS A HUGE THREAT.

633
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:43,174
AS A RETURNING PLAYER, SHE NEEDS
TO GO.

634
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:47,846
THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS I
KNEW I NEEDED TO START

635
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:49,047
ORCHESTRATEING.

636
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,849
IM NOT JUST GOING ALONG WITH
WHATEVER PEOPLE ARE DELG ME TO

637
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:54,853
DO.

638
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:58,256
EVERYONE ON YOUR TRIBE IS
THROWING YOU UNDER THE BUS AND

639
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,791
THINKS YOU SHOULD GO RIGHT BACK
THERE.

640
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:02,293
THERES IN WAY IN HELL I WOULD
SEND YOU BACK, THERE BUT YOU

641
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:03,595
HAVE TO TRUST ME.

642
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,597
WE KNOW YOU AND DAVID LOOK LIKE
A PAIR.

643
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:11,502
WERE NOT GOINGhTG TELL YOU
DETAILS OF NAMES OR WHO OR WHAT,

644
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,737
BUT YOURE NOT GOING HOME.

645
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:17,508
I FEEL TOTALLY BETRAYED BY
THOSE THREE LESU MEMBERS TO SEND

646
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,477
ME RIGHT BACK IS A TOTAL STAB IN
THE BACK.

647
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,681
BUT I GOT PEOPLE ON MY SIDE
APPARENTLY, WHICH IS AWESOME.

648
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,750
WELL, LET ME GIVE YOU THIS.

649
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:27,952
THIS IS THE HALF OF THE IMMUNITY
IDOL.

650
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,621
OKAY.

651
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:32,790
JULIE SAID ALL OF LESU IS
VOTING FOR ME.

652
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:35,493
THEY HAVE NO QUALMS ABOUT VOTING
ME RIGHT BACK OUT.

653
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:39,230
THAT IS SUCH BAD GAME PLAY ON
THEIR PART.

654
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:42,400
JULIE SAID VOTE WITH US
TONIGHT AND WELL SAVE YOU.

655
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:44,769
I DONT EVEN KNOW WHO WERE
VOTING FOR YET.

656
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:47,872
BUT THEY WILL TELL ME, AND THEN
THEY WILL TELL ME WHO TO TELL

657
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:48,473
YOU.

658
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:48,873
IT SHOULD BE WENTWORTH.

659
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:49,574
I AGREE.

660
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:51,042
THANKS FOR THIS, BY THE WAY.

661
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,377
IT MEANS A LOT.

662
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,611
WERE IN IT TOGETHER.

663
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:54,579
WE ARE, DUDE.

664
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,547
A WHOLE WILL THE ON THE LINE
TONIGHT.

665
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,283
I FEEL LIKE IF I CAN GET THROUGH
TONIGHT, THEN WE HAVE THAT

666
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,350
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

667
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:00,985
IT COULD BE A WHOLE NEW
BALLGAME.

668
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:04,822
IT MIGHT BE THE PATH FORWARD IN
THIS GAME IVE BEEN LOOKING FOR.

669
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,257
RIGHT BACK TO WORK, JOE.

670
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,192
GOT TO FINISH IT, BRO.

671
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:15,199
WE GOT WORK TO DO.

672
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,467
WANT TO GO RIGHT NOW?

673
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:17,368
ILL GO.

674
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:18,236
OH, OKAY.

675
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,072
LETS GO.

676
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,006
HEY, BUDDY.

677
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,742
HEY.

678
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,177
WHATS THE PLAN?

679
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,378
WHAT DO I DO?

680
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:31,649
YOU GO FOLLOW THOSE GUYS AND
MAKE SURE THEYRE NOT ON THE

681
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:34,085
CHOPPING BLOCK TONIGHT.

682
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:34,852
OKAY.

683
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,421
I HOPE NOT.

684
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,389
WHO DO YOU WANT TO VOTE FOR?

685
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:39,891
I DONT KNOW, MAN.

686
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:41,225
THIS GAME MOVES FAST, SO A
COUPLE DIFFERENT CLICKS OF

687
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:46,030
PEOPLE GET TOGETHER AND WANT THE
MAKE A MOVE.

688
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:48,232
JOE MADE A MISTAKE.

689
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,768
JOE, WHO DO I VOTED FOR, WHATS
GOING ON?

690
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:51,769
HE WAS VERY VAGUE.

691
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,404
IT DID NOT MAKE ME FEEL GOOD.

692
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:54,939
JOE IS BRUSHING ME ASIDE.

693
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,775
RIGHT NOW I DONT KNOW THAT I
CAN TRUST HIM.

694
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,245
WHAT HE DOESNT KNOW IS MY TRUE
ALLIANCE IS ERIC.

695
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,650
JULIE, JULIA, GAVIN, AND
VICTORIA, WERE THE KAMA SIX.

696
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:09,020
SO IM THINKING JOE LOSING IS A
GREAT OPPORTUNITY, BECAUSE IF

697
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:12,957
YOURE PLAYING "SURVIVOR" AND
YOU HAVE CHANCE TO TAKE OUT JOE,

698
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,125
EVERY TIME IS THE RIGHT TIME.

699
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:17,895
AND SO IVE GOT TO CONVINCE THE
KAMA SIX ITS JOE TONIGHT.

700
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:18,963
THERE THEY ARE.

701
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,198
GUYS, THEYRE HERE.

702
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:25,636
THERES ONE, TWO, RIGHT HERE.

703
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,170
HE DOESNT HAVE AN IDOL.

704
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:27,405
HES NOT EXPECTING IT.

705
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:28,406
JUST THE SIX?

706
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:31,976
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

707
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,611
FOCUS ON THAT ONE.

708
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:35,279
FOCUS ON THAT ONE.

709
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,115
GO SLOW, GUYS.

710
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:37,882
DANG.

711
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:39,817
WE MIGHT HAVE LOST HIM FOR
NOW.

712
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,086
ROUND ONE GOES TO THE
CHICKENS.

713
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,056
RON WANTS TO DO JOE, BECAUSE
JOE LOST.

714
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:50,094
NOW IS THE TIME TO GET RID OF
JOE.

715
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:54,499
I WOULD RATHER GO THE SAFER
OPTION AND GET RID OF KELLEY,

716
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,868
BUT ITS DEFINITELY IMPORTANT TO
GET THE DECISION RIGHT TONIGHT.

717
00:33:56,901 --> 00:34:02,273
ITS
 FEELS GOOD, RIGHT?

718
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:05,710
I ALREADY TALKED TO JULIA.

719
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:06,944
OKAY.

720
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:11,082
WERE JUST REHASHING MAKING
SURE NOTHING HAS CHANGED.

721
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,785
RON WANTS TO VOTE JOE.

722
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:14,852
WHERE ARE YOU?

723
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,522
ID A GO KELLEY.

724
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,623
KELLEY?

725
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:19,590
KELLEY.

726
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:21,959
THERES A LOT OF DIFFERENT
OPTIONS TONIGHT.

727
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:24,228
JOE BEING ONE OF THEM.

728
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:26,130
IVE HEARD RICKS NAME THROWN
OUT THERE.

729
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:29,367
IVE HEARD KELLEY WENTWORTHS
NAME THROWN OUT THERE.

730
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,702
THERES THREE VERY GOOD OPTIONS
ON THE TABLE.

731
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,838
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE
WILL BEST SUIT US.

732
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,540
LETS CHECK IN.

733
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:38,509
IM PRETTY SURE WERE ALL ON THE
EXACT SAME PAGE.

734
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:44,649
I THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE A SHOT
AT EITHER JOE OR KELLEY.

735
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:46,884
TOO SOON TO GET RID OF JOE.

736
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,089
LISTEN, I CAN SEE THE
ARGUMENT FOR JOE, BUT I THINK

737
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:52,356
KELLEY.

738
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,492
IT CAN GO A MILLION DIFFERENT
WAY, BUT AT SOME POINT THE SIX

739
00:34:54,525 --> 00:35:00,064
OF US HAVE TO COME TO A
CONSENSUS.

740
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,334
THERE IS NOT A GENERAL
CONSENSUS AS TO WHO SHOULD BE

741
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:07,004
VOTED OUT, BECAUSE ALL OF US CAN
MAKE A DIFFERENT CASE FOR WHY

742
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:09,640
KELLEY OR JOE SHOULD BE VOTED
OUT TONIGHT, AND THEYRE ALL

743
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:10,508
GOOD CASES.

744
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:11,709
ITS GETTING TRICKY.

745
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:12,977
ITS GOING VERY TRICKY.

746
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,280
IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE
THE RIGHT DECISION, BECAUSE THE

747
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:19,784
VERY FIRST VOTE RIGHT AT THE
MERGE CAN DICTATE THE REST OF

748
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:24,555
THE GAME.

749
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:50,581
Jeff: IF YOU DONT YET HAVE
A TORCH, GRAB ONE AND GET FIRE.

750
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:55,987
WELL NOW BRING IN THE MEMBERS
OF OUR JURY.

751
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,722
WHATS HAPPENING?

752
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:05,963
OH, BOY.

753
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,965
Jeff: REEM, CHRIS, AND
AUBRY, AFTER FAILING IN THEIR

754
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,402
BID TO GET BACK IN THE GAME TOOK
THE OPTION TO RETURN TO EDGE OF

755
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:16,807
EXTINCTION AND AWAIT ANOTHER
CHANCE TO GET BACK IN THE GAME.

756
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,042
ALL RIGHT.

757
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:21,345
JULIE, WHAT WAS THE FEELING WITH
KAMA WHEN YOU REALIZED WE WERE

758
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:22,180
MERGING?

759
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,615
WAS IT THIS COULD BE FANTASTIC
FOR US?

760
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:27,818
IT WAS THE FEELING, BUT WE
WERE ALSO REALLY EXCITED TO MEET

761
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:31,255
NEW SUPREME, PEEK SPEAK TO THEM,
AND START PLAYING THE GAME THAT

762
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,357
WE HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO BEFORE
TONIGHT.

763
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:35,760
Jeff: RON, YOU HAD A
REACTION TO THAT?

764
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:37,228
I LOVE KAMA.

765
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:37,762
EVERYONE KNOWS THIS.

766
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,031
I DIDNT WANT TO SWAP.

767
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:43,100
I LOOK DOWN AND SAW THE YELLOW
BUFF, I SAID, YEP.

768
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:46,370
THEN I LOOK DOWN AND SAW A BUNCH
MORE YELLOW.

769
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:47,505
IM LIKE, THIS IS AWESOME.

770
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,440
Jeff: WENTWORTH, ARE YOU
SURPRISED TO BE SURPRISED TO

771
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:51,542
HEAR RON SAY HES GLAD KAMA
STAYED TOGETHER?

772
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:53,077
IM IN THE MINORITY.

773
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:56,581
IT DOESNT MAKE ME SUPER
EXCITED, BUT OVER THE PAST FEW

774
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,783
DAYS A LOT OF NEW RELATIONSHIPS
ARE FORMING.

775
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:02,053
I DONT KNOW ITS SO CUT AND
DRY.

776
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:05,990
Jeff: ONE OF THE OTHER BIG
STORIES IS EDGE OF EXTINCTION.

777
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:07,725
YOU EARNED YOUR WAY BACK INTO
THE GAME.

778
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:11,395
WHAT DID YOU NOTICE ABOUT THE
TRIBE, THE DYNAMICS CHANGE ALL

779
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:12,663
THE TIME?

780
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:16,500
ALL RIGHT I DONT KNOW THE
LESU DYNAMICS SINCE I LEFT.

781
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:20,905
PLUS I HAVENT MET ANYONE ON THE
ORIGINAL KAMA.

782
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:22,573
I SPENT ALL MY TIME IN
PURGATORY.

783
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:25,943
Jeff: WAS THERE ANY TALK TO
GET RID OF DEVENS SAYING, WE

784
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,612
VOTED HIM OUT ONCE?

785
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:28,879
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

786
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,515
TO SEND IMRIGHT BACK, THERE
THATS STRAIGHT-UP EVIL IN MY

787
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:32,750
OPINION.

788
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:35,686
WHY WOULD WE GET RID OF SOMEBODY
WHO IS NOT A BIG THREAT COMING

789
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,089
INTO THE MERGE?

790
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:40,891
I JUST THINK THERE ARE BIGGER
TARGETS OUT THERE.

791
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,727
Jeff: JOE, WHAT DO YOU READ
INTO THAT IN.

792
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,363
VICTORIA SAID THERE ARE
BIGGER TARGETS.

793
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:47,832
AS A STRONGER PLAYER, THAT
DOESNT MAKE ME FEEL GOOD.

794
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:51,435
I NOW HAVE TO HAVE MANY I LITTLE
TINGLERS GOING OFF, IF YOU WILL.

795
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:55,006
I DONT THINK I SAID PHYSICAL
THREAT, DID I?

796
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:57,074
BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER KINDS OF
THREATS.

797
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,276
THERE ARE STRATEGIC THREATS IN.

798
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:01,412
DID I TAKE IT THE WRONG WAY
IF I FELT THAT WAS DIRECTED AT

799
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,647
ME THEN IT WAS ACCURATE?

800
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,850
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT
ARE THREATENING TO ME, SO I WANT

801
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:08,019
THE CLEAR UP WHAT I MEANT.

802
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,021
Jeff: RON, WHAT ABOUT
IDOLS?

803
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:11,822
PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT IDOLS.

804
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:15,593
I THINK IM FAIRLY PERCEPTIVE
PERSON, BUT I CANT TELL THIS

805
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,327
ANYONE HAS ONE.

806
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,628
NO ONE IS MENTIONING IT.

807
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,063
IT SEEMS LIKE THEY DONT EXIST.

808
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:22,600
EVERY SEASON YOU FEEL THAT
WAY UNTIL ALL OF A SUDDEN FOUR

809
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,735
IDOLS POP UP IN THE SAME TRIBAL.

810
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:27,905
SO IF THERE ARE SOME IDOLS OUT
THERE, MAYBE THEYRE NOT SHARING

811
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:29,106
THAT INFORMATION.

812
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:33,044
Jeff: DEVON, WHAT WAS THE
FEELING AT CAMP THIS AFTERNOON?

813
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:34,645
WAS IT CASUAL?

814
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,447
WAS IT FRENETIC.

815
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,581
DID PARANOIA KICK?

816
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:41,652
WHEN IT CAME TO STRATEGY,
NOBODY WANTS TO TELL YOU WHO

817
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:42,753
THEYRE GOING AFTER.

818
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,690
JOE DIDNT DO ANYTHING TODAY.

819
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:46,824
HE JUST PAINTED.

820
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:49,260
ARE YOU THAT COMFORTABLE THAT
YOU DONT NEED TO TALK TO

821
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:51,862
ANYBODY, OR ARE YOU THAT SCARED
THAT YOURE NOT GOING TO TALK TO

822
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:52,263
ANYBODY.

823
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:53,631
IT WAS WEIRD.

824
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,965
Jeff: WHAT WAS IT, JOE?

825
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,501
I KNOW WHERE I STAND WITH
MEMBERS OF MY TRIBE.

826
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:00,237
I HOME THAT KAMA STRONG DOES
STAY STRONG.

827
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:03,341
IM RELYING ON THOSE PAST
RELATIONSHIPS TO GET ME THROUGH

828
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:04,442
THIS EVENING.

829
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,377
JEFF, WHEN YOU HAVE THE
MAJORITY, YOU DONT NEED TO

830
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,411
SCRAMBLE SO MUCH.

831
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:09,613
WE WERE RELAXED BECAUSE WE KNEW
WE HAD THE POWER.

832
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:12,717
WE DIDNT NEED TO SCRAMBLE.

833
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,352
Jeff: WOW.

834
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,354
WENTWORTH, THATS SO FRUSTRATING
TO HEAR, ISNT IT?

835
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:21,158
YOU KIND OF CHUCKLE, BECAUSE
ITS FUNNY THAT HE SO BLATANTLY

836
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,795
SAID, THAT BUT IF YOURE ME,
YOURE ALWAYS ON THE BOTTOM.

837
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:25,296
SO...

838
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:25,796
Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

839
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,598
TIME TO VOTE.

840
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:37,675
VICTORIA, YOURE UP.

841
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:43,948
VICTORIA, YOURE UP.

842
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:16,547
ILL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

843
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:22,153
Jeff: IF NIBIRU -- IF
ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

844
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:29,393
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

845
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,294
OKAY.

846
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:34,465
ILL READ THE VOTES.

847
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:40,671
FIRST VOTE, DEVENS.

TWO VOTES DEVENS, TWO VOTES

857
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:03,360

THATS THREE VOTES DAVID.

859
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,703
JOE.

JOE.

00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:18,042
THATS TWO VOTES JOE.

862
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:18,676
JOE.

863
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:19,443
WERE TIED.

864
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:26,617
THREE VOTES JOE, THREE VOTES

JOE.

866
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:32,923
THATS FOUR VOTES JOE.

867
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:36,093
SEVENTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE
FOURTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY, JOE.

868
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:36,660
THATS FIVE.

869
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:37,361
THATS ENOUGH.

870
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:39,330
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

871
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:48,272
GOOD PLAY, GUYS.

872
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:51,442
Jeff: JOE, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

873
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:53,043
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

874
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:53,777
BYE, JOE.

875
00:41:53,811 --> 00:42:03,654

THE ONE THING I FEARED
HAPPENING HAPPENED TONIGHT.

898
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,885
IM TRYING THE KEEP MY EMOTIONS
TOGETHER AND NOT BREAK, BUT

899
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,787
MAYBE I NEED TO BE HERE.

900
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,055
SORRY, MAN.

901
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,289
WE WERE ROOTING FOR YOU.

902

THATS SO LAME.

903
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,993
THE THEME OF THE MERGE FLAG

904
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:18,128
YOU GOT TO DIE TO BE BORN AGAIN.

905
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:21,165

DO THIS SEASON.
