JEFF PROBST:
<i>Previously on</i> Survivor...

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,129
<i>The tribes went head to head</i>

3
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:07,424
<i>in one of the most physical</i>
<i>challenges yet...</i>

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,926
<i>and Chuay Gahn finally</i>
<i>ended their losing streak.</i>

5
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:11,553
-Yeah!
-(cheering)

6
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:14,723
<i>At Sook Jai, Robb was</i>
<i>bitter about the loss.</i>

7
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,975
He's a weak, little, whiny punk.
Did you hear him...

8
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:19,227
(speaking gibberish)
...screaming at me, dude?

9
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,562
I wanted to spit in his face.

10
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,939
PROBST:<i> Chuay Gahn got two</i>
<i>Red Beret survival experts</i>

11
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:25,608
<i>for 24 hours as their reward.</i>

12
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,026
<i>But their happy family</i>
<i>had a crisis</i>

13
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,739
<i>when Ted and Ghandia got a</i>
<i>little too close for comfort.</i>

14
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,950
Specifically he was
grinding against-- against me.

15
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:36,661
PROBST:<i> At first Ghandia</i>
<i>accepted Ted's apology.</i>

16
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:39,247
Sometimes when I'm sleeping
in the middle of the night,

17
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,457
I'm not, like, totally clear.

18
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,958
I'm thinking I'm sleeping
with my wife.

19
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,918
PROBST:
<i>But the issue didn't die.</i>

20
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,087
He started biting me
on my shoulder back here,

21
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,006
-like sexy biting, you know,
like... -Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

22
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,258
PROBST:
<i>Ghandia's emotions boiled over.</i>

23
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,927
(screaming)

24
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,680
<i>Ted called a meeting to get</i>
<i>things out in the open.</i>

25
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,182
And the excuse that you gave me,

26
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,808
I thought that that
was disingenuous.

27
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,394
TED: That's funny, because your
comment after I apologized

28
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,813
was to cry and say, "You know,
I really, really needed that,

29
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,690
-and I really appreciate your
honesty." -I did, I did.

PROBST:
<i>Despite all their problems,</i>

31
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:09,819
<i>Chuay Gahn finally won</i>
<i>immunity...</i>

32
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,988
Chuay Gahn, get a little feel
of this for a change.

33
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:13,281
(cheering)

34
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:16,242
<i>...sending Sook Jai to their</i>
<i>first Tribal Council.</i>

35
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,994
<i>And although Shii Ann received</i>
<i>three votes,</i>

36
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:19,704
<i>Jed was voted out of the tribe.</i>

37
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,581
Jed, the tribe has spoken.

38
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,250
<i>13 are left.</i>

<i>Who will be voted out tonight?</i>

40
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,033
(thunder rumbling)

41
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:46,749
ROBB: Are you guys happy
with your decision?

42
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,751
JAKE: I wasn't happy
with being there.

43
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,087
I'm not happy with
getting home this late.

44
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,591
SHII ANN: Didn't feel good to
have my name read out loud.

45
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:58,761
It was not unexpected, you guys,
but still it was like...

46
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,096
Yeah, I figured
I'd at least have

47
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,389
one person
calling my name out.

48
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,057
<i>We had Tribal Council,</i>
<i>and, uh...</i>

49
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,435
I was pretty shocked
with the outcome,

50
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,061
to be completely honest.

51
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,104
<i>I originally thought</i>
<i>that Shii Ann</i>

52
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:10,064
<i>was going to be</i>
<i>the one voted off,</i>

53
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,483
but um, it just goes
to show you, man,

54
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,277
nothing's set in stone
out here.

55
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,738
PENNY: I do not want to go
through again what we went

56
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,573
-through tonight. -JAKE: I
don't, either. I don't ever want

57
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,866
-to go through that again.
-SHII ANN: Me either.

58
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,953
And I want to literally kick ass
in the next reward and immunity

59
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,663
to show them we're not quitters.

60
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,624
PENNY:
<i>I voted for Jed</i>

61
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,751
<i>'cause that's what the majority</i>
<i>wanted to do.</i>

62
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,587
Jed was trying to run the show
around here and be the leader

63
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,297
<i>and wouldn't take</i>
<i>anyone else's advice</i>

64
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,424
<i>if it wasn't his way.</i>

65
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,009
And I think we made
a good choice.

66
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,053
(thunder crashing)

67
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,477
(rain falling)

68
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,712
Good morning.

69
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,549
STEPHANIE:<i> They got rid of Jed.</i>
<i>Piss on 'em.</i>

70
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,843
I really couldn't believe it.
I mean, I was shocked.

71
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,553
<i>As hard as this is right now,</i>

72
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,807
<i>I don't think you get rid of</i>

73
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,530
SHII ANN:<i> We were going to</i>
<i>go out and look for food</i>

74
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,365
<i>when the tide got</i>
<i>a little bit lower,</i>

75
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,201
<i>but there was a bunch</i>
<i>of squid on the beach.</i>

76
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:46,494
And, um, Stephanie found it.

77
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,127
STEPHANIE:<i> You know, I don't</i>
<i>understand them at all,</i>

78
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,004
with food right
in front of their face

79
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,380
and-and whining
about being hungry.

80
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,549
<i>That just disgusts me.</i>

81
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,718
Don't burn your
little tootsies off.

82
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,638
You guys, let's not use a big
pot to ever cook any seafood.

83
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,890
Let's keep the big pot
just for water.

84
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,059
-I got more squid.
-JAKE: You found two more?

85
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,395
You guys must not
even be looking.

86
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,147
They're laying
right here in front of you.

87
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,356
JAKE: Well, actually, we've
been tending the fire.

88
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,566
STEPHANIE:
All of you?

89
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,568
-All five of you?
-No, no.

90
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,320
Stick it where you want it.

91
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,200
SHII ANN:<i> I don't know what</i>
<i>Stephanie's problem is.</i>

92
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,577
<i>Honestly,</i>
<i>I think she just feels</i>

93
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,370
<i>like she's doing</i>
<i>all of the work,</i>

94
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,580
which is totally not true.

95
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:34,625
<i>And I think she just feels</i>
<i>like we're all idiots,</i>

96
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,002
which again, is not true.

97
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,754
She just hates us.
I don't know why.

98
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,005
JAKE: I don't know
what the deal is.

99
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:42,592
She hasn't wanted to be a part
of our group since we started.

100
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,720
Squid laying out here and all
five of them are over there

101
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,930
working on the fire or whatever
the hell they're doing.

102
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,932
The tide could come up
and wash them away.

103
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,768
It's kind of like the screwing
in the light bulb joke,

104
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,438
you know, I mean, how many does
it take to build a damn fire?

105
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,025
ROBB: This whole piece
is about done right here.

106
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:04,113
-PENNY: It'll be nice to eat
this morning. -Mm.

107
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,283
ERIN:
<i>Stephanie, with her attitude,</i>

108
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,534
<i>nobody wants that around.</i>

109
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,454
You know, we have enough of
other elements going against us:

110
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,830
the rain, the wind, you know,

111
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,957
<i>not having any food.</i>

112
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,543
<i>And then to have someone</i>
<i>be grumpy like that...</i>

113
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,962
<i>If I was in her position,</i>
<i>I would just suck it up</i>

114
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,298
<i>and try to, you know, fit in</i>
<i>as well as I could</i>

115
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,092
so that I could
stay on the island.

116
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,986
JAN:
<i>People are getting tired.</i>

117
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,988
<i>There are some people on edge</i>

118
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,950
<i>since the incident</i>
<i>with Ted and Ghandia.</i>

119
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:52,245
<i>The mood's a little bit mellow.</i>

120
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,831
<i>It's kind of, um... unspoken.</i>

121
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,457
<i>No one's going</i>
<i>to mention it again</i>

122
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,667
<i>because they had their talk.</i>

123
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,751
<i>Everybody was there,</i>

124
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:02,088
<i>so each person has</i>
<i>to process both sides,</i>

125
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,756
<i>and then they have</i>
<i>to handle it themselves.</i>

126
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,717
<i>But the mood is different.</i>
<i>Um...</i>

127
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:10,138
It's not as jovial
as it used to be.

128
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,865
GHANDIA:<i> I think it's stupid</i>
<i>the way Ted's acting.</i>

129
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,910
<i>It's absolutely asinine, and if</i>
<i>Ted really wanted to let it go,</i>

130
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,246
<i>then he would let it go</i>
<i>and then it would be cool.</i>

131
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,331
<i>But Ted is set in the</i>
<i>atmosphere that if Ghandia</i>

132
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,667
<i>comes around, don't say</i>
<i>nothing, don't laugh, you know?</i>

133
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,586
<i>It's just... it's really,</i>
<i>it's really crappy.</i>

134
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,713
<i>I can't make him talk to me.</i>
<i>That's his choice.</i>

135
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,841
That's how he's dealing with his
anger, not talking to me,

136
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,510
<i>not looking at me, trying</i>
<i>to ignore me completely,</i>

137
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,887
<i>like I'm not even here.</i>

138
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,681
<i>So as a result of that, people</i>
<i>who he's hanging around with</i>

139
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,057
<i>adopt that same behavior.</i>

140
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,185
<i>It's a really bad feeling.</i>

141
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,853
<i>I feel like as a body,</i>

142
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,522
<i>if Chuay Gahn was a body,</i>
<i>then I'm the arm</i>

143
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:05,443
that got bit off by a shark
and now it's not there no more.

144
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,696
How is it, Mama?

145
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,781
Oh... spicy.

146
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:11,908
I like it.

147
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,785
TED:<i> The relationship</i>
<i>between Ghandia and I,</i>

148
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,330
I don't talk to her,
I don't look at her.

149
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,581
I don't do anything with her.

150
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,417
<i>Initially, I thought</i>
<i>she was a very nice person.</i>

151
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,128
<i>However, when, um, she tried</i>
<i>to exploit my family</i>

152
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:28,424
<i>and really tried to damage my</i>
<i>name, my character, etc.,</i>

153
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:29,884
<i>um, it was a totally different</i>

154

outlook that I had for her.

155
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,930
And so as far as I'm
considering,

156
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,014
<i>she's nonexistent.</i>

157
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,642

If I would've cuddled up

I would have probably done
the same thing...

162

I'm-a tell you what. I wouldn't
have waited till morning.

163
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,113
I'd have said, "Ted, get your
... away from me right now."

164

Right.

165
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,407
When I first saw Ghandia,
I didn't like her.

166
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,953
I mean, when I first saw her, I
said, "This is a problem woman."

167
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,247
<i>I was hoping she wasn't</i>
<i>going to be on my tribe.</i>

168
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,415
<i>I saw a lot of trouble</i>
<i>with Ghandia.</i>

169
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,001
When I first saw her, that's
just the way I had her pegged.

170
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,962
Then after we got out here,
I thought maybe I was wrong.

171
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,172
Maybe I was a little bit wrong.

172
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,674
But nutty buddy, did the
blood come to the forefront.

173
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,259
-Uh-huh.
-Wow.

174
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,844
Do I feel sorry for Ghandia?
Hell, no.

175
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,973
I'm ready to get her ass back
in Denver as quick as I can.

176
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,266
If they can get
a fast jet here,

177
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:21,143
she needs to get on and get the
hell out of here for my sake.

178
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:25,314
GHANDIA:
So much love in the cave.

179
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,191
You can just feel all the love

180
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,485
just oozing out of the pores
of the cave.

181
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:31,153
Love, love,

182
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,823
love, love, everywhere.

183
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,159
These six self-sacrificing
people,

184
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,829
commune together in this cave.

185
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,706
It's just a big love fest.

186
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,457
Even when people
don't talk to you,

187
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,001
they show you that they love you

188
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,836
because they're trying
to teach you a lesson.

189
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,009
And that's love, too, you know?

190
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,018
This is so beautiful here.

191
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,519
It sure feels good.

192
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:05,187
I still didn't see
too many fish.

193
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,440
I saw a couple of fish
jumping out of the water.

194
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,524
-Yeah.
-All right.

195
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:10,359
-Fishing is tough out here.
-It is.

196
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,862
HELEN:<i> I did work for</i>
<i>the rape crisis center</i>

197
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,490
<i>for a number of years.</i>
<i>I do believe Ghandia's story.</i>

198
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,492
<i>Um, I don't believe Ted's side.</i>

199
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,827
<i>Ted wants to believe</i>
<i>Ted's side.</i>

200
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,830
<i>The guys will believe</i>
<i>Ted's side, and there's where</i>

201
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:26,250
between the sexes, there's
a conflict of understanding.

202
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,170
<i>Did Ghandia maybe give Ted</i>
<i>the wrong impression</i>

203
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:32,048
<i>by being as free as she is?</i>

204
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,883
Maybe.

205
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,761
<i>Is that an excuse</i>
<i>for doing what he did?</i>

206
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,804
<i>No.</i>

207
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,558
Somewhere in the middle
there lies the truth.

208
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:45,311
Y'all, I can barely get
to my calendar.

209
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,569
Day ten, and I don't know
what day of the week

210
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:56,655
or anything, but it's...
We've been here ten days

211
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:00,743
and we're still alive.

212
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,079
-(chuckles)
-TED: Alive.

213
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,706
JAN:
We are alive!

214
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,526
CLAY:<i> When I first walked</i>
<i>around there</i>

215
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:34,610
<i>and saw that big old dummy,</i>

216
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:37,405
I thought, "Gosh what in the
world is going on?"

217
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,949
<i>At first, I started just to</i>
<i>pick up the dummy and leave,</i>

218
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,450
but you didn't drag that thing.

219
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,119
It probably weighs
a couple hundred pounds.

220
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,122
Hey, y'all, we got
some treemail.

221
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,291
My God, part of it I can't get.

222
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,626
Serious treemail.
Got a banana.

223
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:53,295
HELEN:<i> Clay went over and</i>
<i>started yelling "treemail,"</i>

224
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,131
<i>which came with</i>
<i>a pretty bruised-up,</i>

225
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,800
<i>nasty-looking banana,</i>
<i>but out here,</i>

226
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,802
it looked like heaven.

227
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,262
No, don't drop it.

228
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,973
CLAY: All right, somebody may
have to help me with...

229
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,141
Oh, my God.

230
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,517
HELEN:
"Kind of big and lazy,

231
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,811

GHANDIA:
Now look on the back.

239
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,660
That dummy over there.

-TED: What dummy?
-There's a dummy over there.

241
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,663
I said, "I can't carry
the damn thing."

-I need some help.
-TED: You lie.

I swear to God
there's a dummy over there,

00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,334
big as your ass.

-Okay, what are we going
to name him? -Good question.

246
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,141
-This thing is ginormous. -First
of all, is it a boy or a girl?

247
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,809
They keep talking
like he's a he, don't they?

248
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,186
ERIN: With all the material
and stuff,

249
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,521
it might be easier
to do a girl, though.

250
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,814
I don't know.

251
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,232
I don't care.

252
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,988

I just hate those dark colors.

-We've got a grass skirt.
-A grass skirt?

254

CLAY: We need to find some kind
of straw and make some hair.

255

-Let's make her a girl.

What do you think-- Chuay Gal?

257
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,123
(all shouting)

258
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,042
ERIN: I think we should make her
look like a pirate,

259
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,170
'cause that's what this
island's about or whatever.

260
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,714
SHII ANN: Blackbeard was
a famous pirate.

261
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,387
JAKE: We need some big,
strong warrior name.

262

-ROBB: Name him Genghis, dude.
-SHII ANN: Genghis Khan.

he was from Afghanistan

-or someplace...
-Yeah.

fingernails, Brian.

266

Just let your creativity flow.

00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,775
GHANDIA: That looks really cool.
She looks like Madonna.

GHANDIA:<i> I think we are ready</i>
<i>for this challenge.</i>

269
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,403
<i>The whole tribe really</i>
<i>came together</i>

270

<i>really did a good job.</i>

SHII ANN:<i> Yeah, decorating the</i>
<i>tribe member was interesting.</i>

276
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,433
<i>It ended up being Stephanie</i>
<i>doing almost all of the work.</i>

277
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,061
<i>It was not a team effort</i>
<i>at all.</i>

278
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,938
<i>I just sat back.</i>
<i>Ken just sat back.</i>

279
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,147
<i>Jake sat back.</i>

280

<i>Penny sat back.</i>

Oh, Stephanie
didn't want any help.

282
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,444
<i>No, she didn't want any help.</i>

283
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,154
<i>And he looks great,</i>
<i>don't get me wrong,</i>

284
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,199
<i>but it was by no means</i>
<i>a team effort.</i>

285
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,117
I just want to know

286
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,535
what the hell the deal was
with the banana.

287
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,163
Why a banana?

288
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,665
<i>For the reward challenge today,</i>

289
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,625
<i>we definitely want to win,</i>
<i>for two reasons:</i>

290
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,086
The two reasons would be
we don't want to die,

291
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,422
and second would be because we
want to, you know,

292
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,798
get the morale back up.

293
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:44,633
JAKE: Good job.
That looks really cool.

294
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,051
That dude's looking pretty mean.

295
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,436
PROBST:
Come on in, guys.

296
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,982
Welcome, guys, to Ko Chuka,

297
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,984
an island not far
from Koh Tarutao.

298
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,944
Okay, I know you guys
spent today

299
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,279
building your new tribe members,

300
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,947
and I got to say
they look pretty good.

301
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,824
Sook Jai, tell me about
your new tribe member.

302
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:10,534
ROBB: We came up with a warrior
named Oaturat.

303
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,328
-PROBST: Oaturat.
-That's "Tarutao" backwards.

304
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,496
PROBST: The newest member
of Sook Jai.

305
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,789
Chuay Gahn, tell me about this.

306
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:16,957
Her name is Chuay Gal.

307
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,459
GHANDIA:
She's a bit lazy, though.

308
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,336
PROBST: Not doing much?
Not pulling her own weight?

309
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,712
-No.
-PROBST: That's actually perfect

310
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:25,049
because today's challenge is
exactly about that:

311
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,009
carrying the weight
of a tribe member

312
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,969
who can't carry
their own weight.

313
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,721
Today, literally,
you're going to carry

314
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:31,889
your new tribe members

315
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,140
<i>around this island.</i>

316
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,266
<i>It's not going to be easy.</i>

317
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,517
<i>Your new tribe member</i>
<i>weighs 250 pounds,</i>

318
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,854
<i>but you'll make your way down</i>
<i>along the shore.</i>

319
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:40,064
<i>When you get</i>
<i>to the halfway point,</i>

320
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,440
<i>that's where you hit</i>
<i>your first major obstacle.</i>

321
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,860
<i>Using the ropes, you're going</i>
<i>to climb up a steep hill</i>

322
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:46,070
<i>and get your new tribe member</i>

323
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,364
<i>up and over to the other side</i>
<i>of the island.</i>

324
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,698
Once you're over the hill,

325
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,492
you'll navigate
your new tribe member

326
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:54,161
<i>along the rocky shore,</i>
<i>through the archway,</i>

327
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,954
<i>and that'll put you</i>
<i>right back here.</i>

328
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,207
The first tribe to get back here
with their tribe member

329

It is your first food reward.

(gasping and cheering)

332
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,216
Enough bananas
to last a long time.

333
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,551
Some of them are ripe and
ready to eat right now.

334
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,720
In fact, you can start in after
the challenge, if you win.

335
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,890
In addition, there is also
a mystery food reward

336

Come on, baby.

right, Sook Jai, because

340
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,526
you have one extra member,
you have to sit somebody out.

341
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,152
You chose Shii Ann to sit out.

342

Take your start positions.
Wait for my go.

343
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:33,450

You guys are dead even.
Keep it up.

Move forward, Jake.

355
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,479
You're doing a hell of a job,
baby boy.

356
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,106
Almost there, guys.

357
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,941

-Come on!

-Guys?
-For a minute.

363
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,307
One, two, three.

364
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,308
Right here.

365
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,810
-Move. Move.
-Don't look back.

366

Squeeze through.
We've got to go over.

367
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,108
We've got to go over the bridge.

368
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,619
Breathe. Breathe in through your
nose, out through your mouth.

-Come on, Helen.
-All right.

374
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,356
See those bananas?
We can almost taste them, baby.

375
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,066
-Yeah!

PROBST: Way to finish strong,
Chuay Gahn.

385

Hell of a job, dudes.
Good jobs, you guys.

PROBST:
Guys, they are your bananas.

387
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,069
You can partake,

-Ken gets the first good one.

-ROBB: Yes!
-Oh, my God.

391
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,954
Bananas are my new favorite food

ERIN:
That's so good.

393
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,457
It's the best one
I've ever tasted, I think.

394
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,125
KEN:
Me, too.

395
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,293
Oh, my God, it is so good.

397
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:16,924
PROBST: Chuay Gahn, you guys
can head back to camp.

398
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:20,677
Sook Jai, take your bananas
and get on out of here.

399
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,575
Yep, that was a rough one.

400
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,660
(grunts)

401
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,994

CLAY:<i> As far as the other tribe</i>

403
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,334

404
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,336
<i>uh, they got about halfway</i>
<i>through the course</i>

405
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,004
and they, they were finished.

406
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,048
TED: All I know is we were
pushing and pulling,

407
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,049
pushing and pulling, and...

408
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,050
(Clay mumbles)

409

...homegirl got heavier

410
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,679

I was like,

411

-"Come on, Chuay Girl."
-BRIAN: She was heavy.

412
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,015
CLAY:<i> Ted and Brian</i>
<i>both kind of made mention</i>

413
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,142
<i>that we looked down</i>
<i>two or three times,</i>

414
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,145
<i>and Ghandia was pulling and</i>
<i>pushing backwards on the dummy</i>

415
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,982
<i>to get herself up the hill.</i>

416
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,358
That's the reason I
changed positions,

417
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,193
'cause the way it was going,
it wasn't going to work.

418
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:19,528
We didn't have a chance in hell.

419
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,074
Ghandia didn't have on
the right shoes.

420
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,492
I saw her one left foot,

421
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,703
her left shoe came off,
so she was

422
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,037
just kind of holding on
to the back.

423
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,122
TED:
Okay.

424
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:33,250
And then, uh, Granny--
I mean, how much use is she?

425
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,752
Yeah.

426
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,005
GHANDIA: And the boys go off
to play the blame game,

427
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,049
and the gals go off to get food,

428
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,843
and you'd better believe
they're playing the blame game

429
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,679
right now because the two
punk asses was already doing it

430
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,055
when they were sitting
on the log.

431
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,307
-Oh, they were?
-Yeah.

they threw that doll over there,

it went all the way down,
don't you think?"

434
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,064
You know,
that's how Clay do, man.

435
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,066
<i>I think maybe from Ted</i>
<i>and Clay's perspective,</i>

436
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,360
<i>I think they're just trying</i>
<i>to blame other people.</i>

437
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,362
<i>You know, somebody didn't carry</i>
<i>their weight, you know.</i>

438
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:05,782
"Janny was not strong enough,
Ghandia lost her sandal."

439
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,284
You know, that's kind of
how they do.

440
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:10,912
They like to finger-point
and do that kind of bull.

441
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,956
I'll even say it, too.
I ain't no hardbody.

442
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,750
Yeah, I kickbox,
yeah, I work out,

443
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,085
yeah, I have two kids,
yeah, I run around all the time,

444
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,920
but I don't work out
seven days a week.

445
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:19,880
Everybody on there
is physically fit.

446
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,757
-I know, they are...
-And here's the thing.

447
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,800
I didn't come on this game
to win no frigging bananas.

448
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,303
I came on this game to win
some frigging money, okay?

449
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,930
So Moo Cow and, you know,
Fat Albert over there

450
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,767
that's missing food every day,
this game is a test of your will

451
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,852
and your strength and how strong
you are to survive.

452
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,937
-That's right. -So that's the
way you got to think about it.

453
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,606
We ain't gonna be picking
each other apart,

454
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,733
and if they start that ...,
I'm gonna shut that ... down.

455
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:40,734
I don't care.

456
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:41,943
It'll be Ghandia's turn to go.

457
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,488
I ain't gonna play
all that blame game ...

You're gonna get a broken neck.

497
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,648
We're gonna check

498
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:05,026
for eggs every day,
and I expect there to be eggs,

499
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,029
or somebody's getting hacked.

500
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,031
Look at me
when I'm talking to you.

501
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,199
(laughs)

502
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:15,203
<i>I feel amazing, nourished,</i>
<i>happy, thankful,</i>

503
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,914
<i>about every good emotion</i>
<i>you can imagine feeling.</i>

504
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,583
Things aren't so bad
out here, man.

505
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,210
CLAY: Take the weight off of
you, and here we gonna go.

506
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,045
Ooh, did y'all see
that fish right there?

507
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,046
Uh-uh.

508
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,549
-The fish is teasing us, huh?
-BRIAN: Yeah.

509
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,135
Eventually we'll catch something
with that net.

510
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,430
You know?

511
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,348
Once the fish get brave enough
to come in.

512
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,103
We still haven't seen too many
fish come in, but that's okay.

513
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,521
CLAY: That's the first fish
I've seen jump out

514
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,565
in front of our camp.

515
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,569
(yawns)

516
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:51,031
Hopefully the guys are
down looking for clams.

517
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,283
I told Clay, you know,
"You can turn over rocks

518
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,744
and find clams," so I'm hoping
that's what they're doing.

519
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,370
I don't know
what they're doing right now.

520
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,914
I haven't checked on them.

521
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,041
It's not...
I'm not on boy watch today.

522
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,834
(laughter)

523
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,836
Oh, boy.

524
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,424
Lordy, Lordy.

525
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,259
JAN:
<i>I'm starting to feel</i>

526
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,386
<i>that there's tension</i>
<i>with the workload.</i>

527
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,597
<i>The men aren't</i>

528
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,891
pulling their weight
or offering,

529
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,476
"Can I help do something?"

530
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,229
<i>It appears to me</i>
<i>that the men are,</i>

531
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,773
<i>are kind of monitoring</i>
<i>like the Thai men.</i>

532
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,943
<i>They go out and fish, they come</i>
<i>back, their day's over.</i>

533
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,945
Well, then the women have
to clean the house,

534
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:33,657
<i>make sure it's all tidy,</i>
<i>do the breakfast, do the lunch,</i>

535
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,117
<i>clean up, do the dishes,</i>
<i>come... you know,</i>

536
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,410
<i>so after a while,</i>

537
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,663
<i>especially when everybody's</i>
<i>supposed to be working,</i>

538
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,122
that would get on your nerves.

539
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,250
Seems like the only people
that know how to multitask

540
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,751
around here are sitting up here.

541
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:47,003
(laughter)

542
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,630
That's all I'm gonna say
about that.

543
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,925
I ain't gonna be quiet
about that too much longer.

544
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,760
I'm getting tired of us doing
all the work preparing the food.

545
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,845
Look what they're doing--
swimming?

546
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,639
I have a husband at home, okay?

547
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,475
I didn't come here
to acquire three more.

548
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:03,478
JAN: I'm putting an order in
for a bigger butt next life.

549
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:06,982
BRIAN:<i> Well, I think that's just</i>
<i>the natural transition in lif.</i>

550
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,276
Um, ladies in the kitchen and
the men take care of business

551
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,610
and do all the fishing, um...

552
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,154
<i>That resorts back to thousands</i>
<i>and thousands of years.</i>

553
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,489
<i>Like, it's right here,</i>

554
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:17,158
<i>we're in the jungle, we're</i>
<i>back in the good old days,</i>

555
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,828
<i>and, uh, it's just they</i>
<i>naturally went to their duties,</i>

556
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,997
<i>which is cooking and cleaning,</i>

557
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,124
and actually I got some clothes
I've got to have them wash, too.

558
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,125
Let me go talk to them.

559
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,835
"Ladies, um..."

560
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:30,505
HELEN:
<i>Now, you could stand there</i>

561
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:32,465
<i>and, you know, start demanding</i>

562
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:33,717
<i>that they help.</i>

563
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,884
<i>What's that going to do</i>

564
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,012
for me--
get me the next vote off?

565
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,638
<i>You got to play the game.</i>

566
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,181
<i>I-I'm telling you,</i>

567
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,349
<i>I've worked with guys</i>
<i>long enough...</i>

568
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,309
Lower, right here?

569
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,311
Uh-huh, that's it.
It was up at the top.

570
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:48,398
Sometimes you got to swallow
some of that to stay alive.

571
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:03,872
<i>We really have split</i>
<i>into a men's/women's group.</i>

572
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:08,209
<i>With Ted, you're dealing with a</i>
<i>macho has-been football player</i>

573
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,878
<i>who's still living</i>
<i>in those glory days.</i>

574
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,379
<i>That-That's...</i>

575
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,423
It's almost hard for any woman
to break into that

576
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:17,177
as a friend, um,
or as a teammate.

577
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,764
<i>Then you got Clay,</i>
<i>who's from an era</i>

578
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,891
<i>and an area that, again,</i>

579
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,393
<i>doesn't view a woman</i>
<i>as an equal.</i>

580
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,021
<i>Never gonna happen.</i>

581
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,064
<i>And Ghandia</i>

582
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,358
<i>is-- she-- it's starting</i>
<i>to get to her.</i>

583
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:34,110
<i>I understand why,</i>
<i>fully understand why, but</i>

584
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:38,114
I just don't see a need right
now to cause discord in camp.

585
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,950
<i>We, we need to focus</i>
<i>on our next challenge,</i>

586
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,787
<i>and we need to have</i>
<i>everybody working together.</i>

587
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,269
PROBST:
First things first.

588
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,521
Ted.

589
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,942
Immunity back up for grabs.

590
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,486
Yesterday's reward challenge
was, without question,

591
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:19,197
the toughest physically that
you guys have had to endure.

592
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,949
Today's? Simple-- it's brains.

593
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,076
It is a puzzle that dates back
thousands of years

594
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,077
in Asian culture.

595
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,412
It's called the tangram.

596
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,746
Here's how it works.

597
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,705
Take one sheet of wood

598
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:31,626
and you cut it
into seven distinct shapes.

599
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:32,669
With those seven shapes,

600
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:35,922
you can then create
an endless array of images.

601
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,757
Today you guys are going
to create two images.

602
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,135
One is fire,

603
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:44,055
the second is Tribal Council
in the form of a temple.

604
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,056
You'll work in pairs.

605
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,143
Once two tribe members solve one
of the images,

606
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,687
you swap out and you bring in
two new tribe members.

607
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,649
First tribe to solve both images
correctly keeps their fire,

608
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:55,817
avoids Tribal Council.

609
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,154
For the losers, another date
with me at Tribal Council

610
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,156
where somebody else will be
voted out of the tribe.

611
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,323
Sook Jai, you have one extra.

612
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,450
You're sitting somebody out.

613
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,492
You cannot sit
the same person out.

614
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,660
You've chosen Stephanie.

615
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:07,120
Take your positions.

616
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,288
Wait for my go.

617
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,498
Immunity at stake, here we go.

618
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,958
Survivors ready?

619
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,043
-Yeah. -Yes.
-Go!

620
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,339
Which way is the top?

621
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,636
-This one like this.
-Yeah.

622
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,929
Talk to me.

623
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,097
Talk to me on the bottom.

624
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,640
HELEN: Clay, biggest ones
are on the bottom. That one,

625
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,017
Ted, in your hand,
that goes next.

626
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,226
-Which one?
-Ted, take the big one

627
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,227
you've got there, push it down.

628
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,187
Put the smaller one next.

629
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,689
-Like this?
-The smaller triangle next.

630
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:35,565
I need a smaller triangle.

631
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:38,610
Yeah, like that--
boom, boom, boom. Yours?

632
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,237
-Right here?
-No, other way.

633
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,864
-This one?
-No, the triangle right here.

634
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,283
-Off the top piece, and it's
not point... -Sorry, got you.

635
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,660
SHII ANN: It's obviously not
the two big triangles--

636
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,371
that's all I can say--
that go in there.

637
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,998
Take the big one out
that you just put in, Ted.

638
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,709
-Take that out, put it
in the match place. -Okay.

639
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:57,045
-Put it in the match place. Put
th... -CLAY: We still don't have

640
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,713
the base, and that's
what we're after.

641
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:00,173
GHANDIA: Use that triangle
to start your base

642
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,216
-and build from there.
-Okay, wait, wait.

643
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,759
-There-- here... -We have,
see, one triangle left.

644
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,219
Okay, here-here's
what's going to happen.

645
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,220
This is gonna have
to go up here.

646
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,471
-You need to save the
triangle out. -Right.

647
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,348
But here's the way it's going
to go. Now we've got to fill

648
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,016
this in somehow
with what we got.

649
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:12,560
SHII ANN: Put the square
next to the little triangle.

650
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,062
ROBB: Then how's the other one
going to match up?

651
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,063
SHII ANN:
That square is in the middle,

652
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,023
and I think that little
triangle's on top of it.

653
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,399
KEN: Switch the little triangle
in the square.

654
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,400
-There you go.
-There you go.

655
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,070
-Nope.
-Nope, almost.

656
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,030
-It's got to be straight, Ted,
right there. -No, it doesn't.

657
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,532
Now, all you have to do
is just put this up here.

658
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:26,491
That can't hang out there.

659
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,575
-Look. Oh, okay.
-That can't hang out there.

660
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,410
-No, turn it, turn it, turn it.
-No, what you had...

661
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,038
Just right there, right there.
We're done.

662
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,706
-That's it. -We're done!
-PROBST: That's it.

663
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,750
Sook Jai gets their first one.
Switch out and move on.

664
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,752
-TED: Jeff, Jeff...
-PROBST: Slow, slow down.

665
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:39,921
-Jeff.
-I'm looking.

666
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:40,922
Slide out.

667
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,590
Let me look.

668
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:43,466
That's it.

669
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,467
-Move on.
-Yes!

670
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,885
-Go.
-CLAY: Next two, next two.

671
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,929
We are tied 1-1.

672
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,098
First tribe to complete
the temple doesn't have

673
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,558
to go to the temple.

674
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,561
Way to work together, guys.

675
00:30:55,853 --> 00:30:56,896
You guys have already
solved the fire.

676
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,898
That is your life
at Tribal Council.

677
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,276
Now you're trying to complete
the Tribal Council.

678
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,277
ROBB:
Check it out.

679
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,070
Make it square across the top

680
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:04,946
of that bottom triangle.

681
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,781
Make it flat,

682
00:31:06,864 --> 00:31:08,449
just how you had it, baby,
you had it right.

683
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,701
-No, no, no.
-Like this?

684
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:10,952
Yeah, put the square...

685
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,954
How about putting the square...?

686
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,791
ROBB:
You see what I'm saying?

687
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:18,334
Like that, yeah.

688
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,628
-That's what...
-There, that's it.

689
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,922
That's what I meant, you guys,
straight, just like the picture.

690
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,593
CLAY:
Yes.

691
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:27,760
Now, put the other piece
down here--

692
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,137
no, the other piece
on the other side.

693
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,388
TED: Whoa, whoa,
let 'em think, let 'em think,

694
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,598
let 'em think.

695
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,182
CLAY:
They need to pick it back up

696
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,268
to make it across
and set that down on it.

697
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,436
Clay, let 'em think.

698
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,730
I am.

699
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,189
-Now, how does this...?
-JAKE: Now, that's got to go out

700
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,190
and make a little...

701
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,320
There you go, that's good.

702
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,529
PENNY:
Make a square.

703
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,822
Is this it?

704
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:49,699
-Jeff.
-Jeff, Jeff.

705
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:01,794
-Sook Jai... wins immunity.
-(cheering)

706
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,842
Sook Jai, yeah!

707
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,018
Sook Jai, it's going back home

708
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,311
-with you again.
-Thank you. -Yay.

709
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:22,023
You're free from Tribal Council
three more days on the island.

710
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,941
Chuay Gahn, unfortunately,

711
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,693
I'll see you tonight
at Tribal Council.

712
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,153
Somebody else is going home.

713
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,155
You can head back to camp.

714
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:06,025
GHANDIA:<i> We have to go</i>
<i>to Tribal Council, and,</i>

715
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,235
<i>you know, that's just it.</i>

716
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,070
<i>I don't feel good about it.</i>

717
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,113
<i>As far as my vote's concerned,</i>

718
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:13,449
<i>it's a toss-up</i>
<i>between Ted and Clay.</i>

719
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,785
<i>They're basically</i>
<i>like Mutt and Jeff,</i>

720
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,620
Frick and Frack.

721
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,247
You know, they're joined
at the hip.

722
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,415
Anything in your belly is good.

723
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,708
This is some good eating.

724
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:22,834
GHANDIA:
<i>So I need</i>

725
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:23,960
<i>to explain and express</i>
<i>to the other two women</i>

726
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:28,089
<i>that that's our best chance</i>
<i>of survival,</i>

727
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,383
<i>is if there's a 3-3 tie,</i>

728
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,760
<i>like three people vote for</i>
<i>Clay, three people vote for me;</i>

729
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:36,264
<i>three people vote for Ted,</i>
<i>three people vote for me.</i>

730
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,641
Otherwise, we're just going
to get picked off like flies.

731
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:41,310
JAN:
It's divided, it's very divided.

732
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,562
-Right.
-It's men and women.

733
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,439
Yeah, and I think
that basically happened

734
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,232
because of Clay and Ted.

735
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,901
-I agree.
-Well, Clay mostly.

736
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:52,238
That's right, you know,
'cause Clay has this old, old,

737
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,573
old, old school mentality.

738
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,949
His back is hurting
and all this.

739
00:33:55,032 --> 00:33:56,409
Well, it's time
for your ass to go.

740
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,953
-He's tired and he takes naps
all the time. -Yeah...

741
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:01,622
JAN:
<i>I feel Clay needs to go.</i>

742
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:05,126
Um, I think he's, he's torn
the team apart.

743
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,087
<i>I think it's the guys on one</i>
<i>side, the girls on the other,</i>

744
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,757
<i>and I think he's been</i>
<i>the main team-splitter.</i>

745
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,966
<i>We're not a team anymore.</i>

746
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:14,051
<i>And I think he's tired.</i>

747
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,261
<i>Uh, he naps a lot.</i>

748
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,387
<i>I just think it's time</i>

749
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,307
for him to go, and maybe
we could heal some of our wounds

750
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,100
and come back as a team.

751
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,186
GHANDIA: Me and Janny
already talked about Clay,

752
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,270
so we wanted to see

753
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:28,149
where your head was at
with voting for Clay, too.

754
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,067
You're voting for Clay, not Ted?

755
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,320
Well, Janny doesn't want
to vote for Ted

756
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,197
because she thinks if we have
another group challenge

757
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,990
that requires a lot
of strength and brawn,

758
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,158
that she wants to keep him.

759
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,494
-Now, you know I don't agree
with that. -(Helen grunts)

760
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,620
But if something happens

761
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,789
where you and I vote for Ted
and she votes for Clay

762
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:45,333
-and the three of them vote
for me, I'm gone. -Yeah, uh-huh.

763
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,794
But if it's a 3-3 tie where it's
three for me and three for Clay,

764
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:48,878
then we'll have
the two-minute conferences,

765
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:51,130
-which I'm sure will be
deadlocked. -Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

766
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,799
-Exactly. -And then it's up
to the rock in the bag.

767
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,717
-That's right. -But here's
where I'm thinking with this.

768
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,052
If we keep the girls together,

769
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,179
then we have a leverage
of a 3-2 vote.

770
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,389
-Mm-hmm.
-And we can get rid of Ted next

771
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,016
'cause we won't need him
too much longer.

772
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,018
-Mm-hmm. -But Janny is not down
for voting for Ted.

773
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:05,186
All right, all right.

774
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,980
And I can put up with Ted's bull
for a couple more days.

775
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,190
You think?

776
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,400
Well, yeah.

777
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,236
-All right, all right.
-I will be so happy tonight

778
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,279
if Clay is gone.

779
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,624
(mumbles)

780
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:36,175
HELEN:<i> Honestly, right now</i>
<i>I'm still betwixt and between,</i>

781
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:39,220
and this is
where the game gets ugly,

782
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,513
<i>because unfortunately</i>

783
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,890
<i>this is where the competitive</i>
<i>part wants to come in.</i>

784
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:43,891
<i>I want to stay,</i>

785
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,186
<i>I want to play,</i>

786
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,230
but it would mean voting
Ghandia off tonight.

787
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,273
(whispers indistinctly)

788
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:53,234
<i>And am I going to be</i>
<i>happy with that?</i>

789
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:57,113
<i>'Cause I do believe</i>
<i>her side of the story, um,</i>

790
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,407
<i>and Clay and Ted are doing</i>
<i>less and less every day.</i>

791
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,117
<i>It's very obvious.</i>

792
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,243
<i>Um,</i>

793
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,286
I am the swing,

794
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:07,039
and I never thought I'd be
the swing vote, but...

795
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,923
<i>I need to think</i>
<i>about it for me.</i>

796
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,425
<i>I really-- I've heard</i>
<i>all the arguments,</i>

797
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,593
<i>I know all the arguments.</i>

798
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,554
<i>I live here, I know the facts.</i>

799
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,391
<i>I don't know.</i>

800
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:28,352
I may not even make it up until
I pull the cap off the pen.

801
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,424
Another Tribal Council.

802
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,592
Yeah.

803
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,345
Take a look to your left.

804
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,596
Three torches

805
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:07,350
representing the first three
people voted out of this game.

806
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,143
Ted, how's that sit,
coming here tonight,

807
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:11,479
knowing somebody's going home
and it may be you?

808
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,815
Anytime we come to the
Tribal Council, it's painful.

809
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,734
As painful as it is,
this is the game.

810
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:19,445
This is the way
the game is played, so

811
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:22,657
we have to basically suck it up
and-and do what we have to do.

812
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,661
Clay, what's the toughest aspect
right now 12 days in?

813
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,664
Uh, th-the food, the heat,
th-the whole thing.

814
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,457
It's, uh, it's tough.

815
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,376
You know, when I left home,
I come here,

816
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,628
my first question was:
how hungry am I going to get?

817
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,505
I'm hungry as hell,
I'm gonna tell you.

818
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,881
I'm tired as hell, I'm weak.

819
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,634
This humidity and this heat
is bothering me,

820
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,803
but, uh, I-I'm still healthy
and I'm still fine.

821
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:46,180
I'm-I'm-I'm going to the end.

822
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:48,849
Helen, what kind of toll
is it taking on you?

823
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,142
I find I worry.

824
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,978
I-I worry every day.
I mean, I get up

825
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,187
in the morning, thinking:
"Oh, my God,

826
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,522
"do we have enough water?
Is it boiled?

827
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,690
"Is it in the clean containers?

828
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,984
"What are we gonna get for food?
Is the tide gonna go out?

829
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,194
"If the tide goes out, can we go
out and get clams, crabs?

830
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:01,320
Are there gonna be
clams and crabs?"

831
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:04,031
I'm just becoming obsessed out
here with: "Oh, my God,

832
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,658
the food, the water, food,
water, food, water."

833
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:06,993
And then we get
a challenge thing

834
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,119
and I'm like, "Oh, my God,

835
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,954
"is it going to be drag another
dummy over the mountain

836
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,831
or is it going to be
brainteaser?"

837
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,040
And, and y-y-you know,

838
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,250
and then coming here.

839
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,710
Talk about adding
more stress to it.

840
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,503
Oh, my God, now I got
to vote somebody off.

841
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:18,295
PROBST:
Ghandia,

842
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,839
everybody pulling
their own weight

843
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:21,132
still in this tribe?

844
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,383
Nope.

845
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,010
Flat-out nope?

846
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,219
Yeah, nope.

847
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:29,390
Some people are just not doing
as much as they could do,

848
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:32,393
and some people
just don't do a lot.

849
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,061
They lay around.

850
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,063
PROBST:
Clay, everybody pulling

851
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,024
-their own weight?
-Uh...

852
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,358
I feel everybody's doing
their part.

853
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,860
I mean, uh, there's days

854
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:41,944
that some of us lay around.

855
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:45,072
There's days that some of us
go fishing and go off

856
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:48,117
and bring back mussels
and go do different things.

857
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,785
It's... Just because
one doesn't cook

858
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,412
and the other one does,

859
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,913
doesn't mean the other one's
not gathering the food to put

860
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,457
in that, uh, pot.

861
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,458
PROBST:
Jan.

862
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,375
Yes.

863
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,501
What's your take on it?

864
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:01,047
I feel that, uh, the tribe
is divided somewhat, I do.

865
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,883
I do feel that we pulled
together on the challenges,

866
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,259
though, as one,

867
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:07,553
but I do feel
there's a division.

868
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,722
It is time to vote.

869
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,182
Ted, you're up.

870
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:25,613
You blew up an issue way beyond
the scope of this game.

871
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,449
For that reason,
this vote is personal,

872
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:32,244
and I truly, truly hope I never,
ever see you in my life again.

873
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,631
You played cat and mouse.

874
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,841
You just didn't do good--
too good at it.

875
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:49,303
You got busted,
so bye-bye, Denver.

876
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:02,358
It's between you and me tonight,
so let the best person win.

877
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,804
I'll go tally the votes.

878
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:49,655
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

879
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:50,614
The person voted out
will be asked

880
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,908
to leave the Tribal Council area
immediately.

881
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,660
I'll read the votes.

882
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,832
First vote...

883
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:01,834
Ghandia.

884
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,089
Clay.

885
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,800
One vote-- Ghandia,
one vote-- Clay.

886
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,388
Ghandia.

887
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,099
Clay.

888
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,101
That's two votes-- Ghandia,
two votes-- Clay.

889
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,067
Well, for the first time
I have a vote

890
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,111
and I have no idea
who it belongs to.

891
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,071
Who wrote "Bye-bye Denver Diva"?

892
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,072
Who's the name?

893
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,115
-Ghandia.
-Ghandia.

894
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,075
Denver, uh, Diva.

895
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,411
-In the future, write
a name down, okay? -Okay.

896
00:41:37,494 --> 00:41:38,454
Enough with the nicknames.

897
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:42,249
That's three votes-- Ghandia,
two votes-- Clay.

898
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,335
Last vote...

899
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:51,050
Ghandia. That's four.
You need to bring me your torch.

900
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:08,234
Ghandia, the tribe has spoken.

901
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:11,862
Stay strong, y'all.
See ya.

902
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,790
PROBST: Well, from the outside
it looked like this was

903
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,625
a tribe that really had it
together.

904
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,294
Clearly, there was some division
within the tribe.

905
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,798
Maybe tonight's vote will help
solve some of that problem.

906
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,841
Grab your torches.
Head back to camp.

907
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:48,607
PROBST:<i> Stay tuned for scenes</i>
<i>from our next episode.</i>

908
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,112
PROBST:
<i>Next time on</i> Survivor:

909
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,905
<i>Sook Jai is reminded</i>
<i>of the dangers</i>

910
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,700
<i>lurking in the sea.</i>

911
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:58,701
(screams)

912
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,953
<i>Chuay Gahn experiences</i>
<i>a big loss.</i>

913
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:02,121
CLAY:
<i>I have no idea</i>

914
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:04,665
-what we're going to do.
-I'm gonna make you an offer.

915
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,835
<i>And an offer that could change</i>
<i>the entire game.</i>

916
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,129
60 seconds-- think about this.

917
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,631
This is an individual decision.

918
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:20,180
I made, um... a big mistake

919
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,850
in trying to play one side
against the other side

920
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,518
because of an event
that happened to me

921
00:43:24,601 --> 00:43:25,811
that I should have just let go.

922
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:28,188
But unfortunately,
the evil Ghandia came

923
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,732
to rule her ugly head.

924
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,859
And the good Ghandia
just couldn't stop her.

925
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:35,154
Have fun, everybody,
still sleeping out in the dirt.

926
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:36,155
(laughs)

927
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,614
Peace out.
