an infamous history.
These waters were home to some

of the most fierce battles
of World War II,

I can tell you that.
Hell, I thought

40
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,507
we were gonna get, you know,
some breakfast,

41
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,552

Hell, no.

something like that,

that he was gonna say,
"The game is on."

44
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,639
Something told me.
We was...

45
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:12,437
pretty much in trouble.
>> As we were rowing the boat,

46
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,439
and we were getting
closer and closer to the beach,

47
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,607
everybody was thinking,
"Should I jump out?

48
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,110
"Should I swim to the shore?
Should I try to beat the boat?"

49
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:28,661
>> ( grunts )
>> The fight was on immediately.

50
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,248
And then people said,
"Oh, I'll take your spot

51
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:35,543
rowing in the back."
And other people were

52
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,545
whispering and wondering,
oh, is that because they want

53
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,630
to be at the back of the boat
so that when the boat gets close

54
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:50,475
to shore, they can run off?

55
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:57,398
to shore, they can run off?

56
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:01,277
>> As we were slowly rowing in,

57
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,612
I was, like,
I think it's close enough,

58
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,448
I'm gonna jump, I'm gonna swim.
'Cause I'm a pretty good

59
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,784
swimmer, so I figured
I could beat the boat.

60
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,578
Didn't seem like we were moving.
Everybody, I'm going.

"I can't take it.

63
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,418

I was right behind her.

All right, let's go!

65
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:33,476
>> Watch out for the oar!
>> I got in,

66
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,228
and, like, every two strokes,
there went the boat,

67
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,687
and I was, like, "Oh, my God,
that's the dumbest thing

68
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,481
I've ever done."
If we get off,

69
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:43,152
can we get back on?
What are your names again?

70
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:47,240
( others laughing )
Oh, my God!

71
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,284
Bad idea, I guess?
>> When Stephenie and Jonathan

72
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,328
dove in the water,
everyone's, like... (sputters)

00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:55,498

That is a gigantic target

00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:05,174
on your head.
>> We were all excited,

76
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,177
because we wanted to jump
and start swimming,

77
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,971
but we didn't.
We kept waiting and waiting

78
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:15,184
and waiting.
>> The competitive nature

79
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,354
in me was like, "You got to take
off your shoes and go!"

00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,395
( whooping )
>> Good job!

81
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:02,732
I got the immunity necklace.
I was not gonna let that...

82
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:07,069
little young girl beat me.
>> Whoo!

83
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,198
>> Good job.
Nice to meet you.

84
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,407
What was your name again?
>> Jeff.

85
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,743
>> Ian.
>> Good job, man.

86
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,454
>> Ian, he was the first one
up there.

87
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,580
Get his ass up there,
skinny boy, I'm telling you,

88
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:23,794
that's a fast little booger.
Well, I don't even know

89
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,255
if we have a tribe,
because I noticed

90
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,717
the banner just says,
"SURVIVOR: Palau."

91
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,928
It doesn't have
any tribe name on it.

92
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:36,307
>> One map, we're all together.
>> Because you've never seen

93
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,768
the game start this way, with
20 people, you get a little...

94
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:39,852
I found myself getting
a little paranoid.

95
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,272
You know, we're not a tribe,
we don't have our buffs,

96
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,649
we're just getting to know
everyone's name.

97
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:48,236
>> I'm Jolanda.
"Jo" if you can't say it.

98
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,613
>> Oh, you guys, they're out
there!

99
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,657
>> Something's gonna happen,
something big's gonna happen.

100
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,743
We can't just remain
as a group of 20.

101
00:08:55,826 --> 00:09:05,878
It's a big question mark.
We don't have a clue

102
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:14,637
It's a big question mark.
We don't have a clue

103
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,973
>> All right, everybody,

104
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,642
let's, um...
think about who wants to do

105
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,478
water, who wants to do shelter.
>> I'll do shelter.

106
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,981
>> I'll do water.
>> Okay, water people...

107
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,441
>> Water.
>> So we got one,

108
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,444
two, three, four,
and Coby's five.

109
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,988
Okay. That sound
like a good plan?

110
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,156
>> Say what?
>> Five people go look for water

111
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,325
and 15 start
on the shelter?

112
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,328
>> Yeah.
>> When we got on the beach,

113
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,539
it was such a bore
with all the immunities

114
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:42,665
and just the craziness
of just being dropped off.

115
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:46,460
But, actually, I think we got
to things fairly quickly.

116
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,838
I mean, we found the map
to the water source,

117
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,381
we started thinking
about shelter and food,

118
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,341
and so people just broke off,
a group of four

119
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,177
broke off to go get water.
And then everybody else

120
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,179
stayed with shelter.
I mean, it was very quick,

121
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:03,019
it happened very fast.
>> He knocked it down

122
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,814
like Paul Bunyan.
>> I know. ( laughs )

123
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,525
>> You okay?
>> Yeah.

124
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:11,402
>> You know, it was funny,
I mean, uh,

125
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:14,155
everybody's just walking around
in different directions.

126
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,032
"Let's get the water,"
"Let's build a shelter."

127
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,034
And, uh,
you just got to watch that.

128
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,578
You know, I had a few people
try to wrangle me

129
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,747
into doing the fire,
and I'm just, like,

130
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,167
that's a loser job, man.
All right.

131
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:33,174
>> Let's get this going.
>> Oh.

132
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,550
I got to go
to the bathroom.

133
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:37,595
>> I'll get some more sticks.
>> Do we have a strong man here?

134
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:38,888
Come on.
Are you like Hercules?

135
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,892
Come on, Hercules.
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

136
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,101
We came out
in the clothes we had on,

137
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,729
and were kind of taken by
surprise that we couldn't have,

138
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,898
you know, the clothes that we
had thought we were gonna have

139
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,192
with us.
It was really difficult,

140
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,902
I know, for a lot of people.
But there have been some great

141
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,488
modifications to it, so...
>> Don't, like, hack,

142
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,698
like, saw.
>> Oh, yeah.

143
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,242
Oh, I've made shorts
back in the day.

144
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,245
>> Oh, gosh, they're just
chopping things off left and

145
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,623
right, pants are falling off,
and skirts are getting

146
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,125
a little bit higher,
and shirts are getting tied up.

147
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,919
I had mine tied up earlier,
but... decided to...

148
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:15,591
stop for now.
>> I'm trying to find

149
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:16,592
the middle.
>> What's that?

150
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:19,720
>> That big rocky thing.
( whooping )

151
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,599
We found it!
Yes!

152
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:26,727
( whooping )
What else?

153
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:30,106
( whooping )
>> We were so excited

154
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,401
to get to the water.
>> Coby!

155
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,277
>> What the hell is this?
>> Shoes!

156
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,530
>> Shoes!
So we finally

157
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,782
found the water source,
and also found a bag

158
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,950
of everybody's shoes,
which was really nice

159
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,328
to take back into camp,
Like, "Look, no more stilettos.

160
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,206
We have real shoes."
>> We can't let young,

161
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:51,085
good-looking people
have all the power.

162
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,921
>> That's what I was thinking.
>> 'Cause there's a lot of them.

163
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,799
>> Yeah.
Me and Coby pretty much knew

164
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,010
when we saw each other
that we were going to be, you

165
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,846
know, kindred to one another
'cause we understood

166
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,389
being different,
we understood being ostracized.

167
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,683
Yeah, I have to say,
I sighed a sigh of relief

168
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,978
when I saw you 'cause I realized
I wasn't gonna be the weirdest

169
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,104
one here.
>> ( laughing )

170
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,815
>> I mean that in a loving way.
>> I felt the same way.

171
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,817
I was, like, "Oh, we're
gonna totally get along."

172
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,404
>> You can tell that Angie and I
are both cut from the same

173
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,365
cloth, in that we think we're
different and we're the

174
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,492
outcasts, but I think we're both
gonna have to watch it

175
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,286
when it comes
to the context of the game,

176
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,705
'cause if we're
too much of an outcast,

177
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,040
obviously it's gonna
make us a target.

178
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,210
>> Now how do we get
that up there?

179
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,837
I don't know.
Tom, what were

180
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,006
you thinking with this?
I got this up here.

181
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,384
Actually, what we're gonna need
is, we're gonna need somebody

182
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,178
to get up here
to start putting

183
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,013
these cross pieces.
>> The boys really

184
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,848
got together and they used...
We used one big tree

185
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:50,019
as our base for our shelter,
and then they put reeds up,

186
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,522
and they said we needed
to tie them at the top,

187
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:58,360
so I offered.
>> Oh, my God.

188
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,530
Nice job.
>> Oh, watch it.

189
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,200
>> There you go.
I'm loving you already.

190
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,076
>> Okay.
I don't know if it was

191
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,704
a good thing or bad thing,
but I wanted to help

192
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,164
and I figured
my rock-climbing skills

193
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,167
would help,
so I climbed that had puppy like

194
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,046
a monkey and I did what I could.
>> Come on, sucker.

195
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,049
>> Where's the sun?
Beating down on me

196
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,135
all day long.
I think it is, like, 2:30.

197
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,513
Do you believe this?
>> I know.

198
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,557
It's amazing.
>> So what are you thinking?

199
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:33,020
Ian, me, you?
Just an early something here?

200
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:36,774
We might all be
split tomorrow, but, uh....

201
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,400
>> I'm in with that,
with you guys,

202
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,069
'cause we would be strong.
The whole thing could

203
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,821
be reshuffled, but...
>> Yeah, absolutely.

204
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:49,078
>> Grasshoppers have protein.
( yelling ):

205
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:53,207
Wow!
I just ate my first grasshopper!

206
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:59,755
Oh, my God.
Do you want to knock off

207
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,091
threats, or do you want to...
You don't know how the game's

208
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,759
going to play out
after that, right?

209
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:06,929
>> Are you not leaning
towards any of the girls?

210
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:11,600
>> Honestly, I'm not leaning
towards anyone.

211
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:16,772
>> I'm leaning towards Jonathan.
The one who jumped in the water.

212
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,774
>> Although he worked so hard
today...

213
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:21,443
>> Everybody's working hard,
really, when you look at it now,

214
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,153
I mean, in their own way.
I'm just going

215
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,114
with connections.
I don't real connect with him.

216
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,449
I don't think I've
said anything to him

217
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,993
the whole time
I've been here. Honestly.

218
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,119
I don't think
he's talked to me either.

219
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,998
Everybody's assumption
at this point

220
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:37,793
is that we're all
basically screwed

221
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:40,129
because we all think we have
Tribal Council, like, now.

222
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,090
>> We don't even know if we're
going to be on the same team.

223
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,634
>> I know, but that's why you
just got to go for today.

224
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,011
Right, but that
could change tomorrow.

225
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,138
>> So we thought we had three
days of at least getting

226
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,265
to know everybody, at least.
You know, we don't know

227
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,100
if we have that,
so everybody's security

228
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,144
has been blown,
so everybody's freaking out.

229
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,647
>> Whoa!
>> But I've definitely

230
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,149
gone to different groups
all day today and said, "Who

231
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,193
are you going to vote for?
"Really? That's interesting.

232
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,987
"What about voting
for this person?

233
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,989
What about Jonathan?
Hmm. Good."

234
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:11,160
And as long as I do it subtly...
You go, boy.

235
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,954
...and sneak it in there,
you can change their minds,

236
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,707
'cause at this point, everybody
doesn't want it to be them.

237
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,485
Good morning, everybody.
>> Good morning.

238
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,369
>> This one's cashed.
>> PROBST: What's going on,

239
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,496
guys?
>> Oh, hey, how you

240
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,081
doing there, Jeff?
>> PROBST: What's up?

241
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,333
>> Here we go.
>> We got visitors!

242
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,294
>> PROBST: What's up?
>> Whoo, Jeff.

243
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:06,965
>> PROBST: How are you?
How's everybody doing?

244
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,759
Big group.
Anxious to know

245
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,220
what's happening?
>> ALL: Yeah!

246
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,179
>> PROBST: All right, so
Jolanda and Ian,

247
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,431
you guys were the first
two to the beach.

248
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,100
Who was the first person?
>> Ian.

249
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,267
>> PROBST: Ian.
All right, Ian,

250
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,062
take a spot right over here,
Jolanda right over here.

251
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,190
Getting a little
uncomfortable over here?

252
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,692
>> Yep.
>> A little nervous now.

253
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,694
>> PROBST: How's that immunity
feel, Jolanda?

254
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,696
>> It feels good.
>> PROBST: It ought to feel

255
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,407
real good.
The immunity necklaces

256
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,742
that you're wearing
guarantee that you're gonna

257
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:38,747
stay in this game
for at least ten more minutes.

258
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:44,086
Which cannot be said
for the other 18 of you.

259
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,255
We're gonna divide
into two tribes

260
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:49,091
with nine members each,
that's 18 people.

261
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,261
There are 20 of you.
Two people will not be selected

262
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:59,977
to be on a tribe.
Two people will get on a boat,

263
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:07,192
immediately, and be sent home.
Ian and Jolanda you will make

264
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,904
the first picks, alternating
between men and women.

265
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,573
Each time you choose a person,
that person will choose the

266
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:16,410
next member of the tribe.
Ian, because were you first to

267
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,996
the beach, you will select
first; you're picking a girl.

268
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:23,375
>> Okay.
>> Uh, Katie.

269
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,879
>> PROBST: Jolanda,
you're picking a guy.

270
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:37,473
>> Bobby Jon.
>> Good choice.

271
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,183
>> PROBST: So, Ian and Jolanda,
your work is done.

272
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,142
The person you pick
will now pick.

273
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:45,481
Katie, you're picking a guy.
>> Tom.

274
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:53,572
>> PROBST: Bobby.
>> Stephenie.

275
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,455
>> PROBST: Tom, you're picking
a woman.

276
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:07,336
>> I'm gonna take Janu.
>> PROBST: Janu, still in the

277
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:11,173
game and relieved.
Steph, you're picking a guy.

278
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:16,678
>> Jeff.
>> PROBST: Jeff, gonna make it

279
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:23,352
to at least the first challenge.
Janu, you're picking a man.

280
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:37,908
>> Gregg.
>> PROBST: Janu, you look upset.

281
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:40,661
>> No, it's just kind of weird.
>> PROBST: Kind of weird?

282
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:44,498
You don't do this a lot?
Jeff, you're picking a girl.

283
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:50,045
>> Kim.
>> PROBST: Kim stays in the

284
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:56,802
game.
Gregg, you're picking a woman.

285
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:09,439
>> Jenn.
>> PROBST: Kim, you're picking

286
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,276
a guy.
>> James.

287
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,408
>> PROBST: Jenn, you're picking
a guy, tough decision.

288
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:25,789
Getting down to it.
>> Uh...

289
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:33,297
Coby.
>> PROBST: James.

290
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:41,054
>> Ashlee.
>> PROBST: Coby, you're

291
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,349
picking a woman.
>> Caryn.

292
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:53,650
>> PROBST: Caryn, how does that
feel to be standing over there?

293
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,110
What's going
through your head?

294
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:56,987
It's not a good
feeling, Jeff.

295
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,990
It's better to be on this side.
>> PROBST: Ashlee,

296
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:06,288
you're picking a guy.
>> Ibrehem.

297
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,257
>> PROBST: You each have one
pick left.

298
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,093
You're gonna pick one guy,
gonna pick one girl.

299
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,013
In doing so, you're gonna pick
the final members of your tribe

300
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:26,350
and effectively vote out
two people from this game.

301
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,311
How you feeling, Wanda?
>> It's been an awful long time

302
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,147
since my heart pounded this
fast.

303
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,149
>> PROBST: Jonathan, how you
feeling?

304
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:36,109
>> I'm just...
My heart's beating.

305
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,612
I thought I was gonna
be picked before this.

306
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:45,285
>> PROBST: Okay, it is time to
make the final selections.

307
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:54,628
Caryn, you're picking a guy.
Make your decision.

308
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:59,466
>> Willard.
>> PROBST: Willard stays in the

309
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:03,971
game, Jonathan is out of the
game.

310
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:12,270
Ibrehem, you're picking a woman.
Make your decision.

311
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:17,526
>> Angie.
>> PROBST: Angie stays in the

312
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:21,697
game.
Wanda is out of the game.

313
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,497
Tough to say, but, guys,
it is time for you to go.

314
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,458
Right past me, you got a boat
waiting out here.

315
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,717
>> Go have some chips and
salsa.

316
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,302
>> Go get it, Wanda.
Go get it, John.

317
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:53,353
Come on, now.
>> I love you, too.

318
00:21:53,437 --> 00:22:00,694
Come on, now.
>> I love you, too.

319
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:03,905
Have a good one, guys.
>> Bye!

320
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,045
>> I was really, really,
really sad.

321
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,547
But that's all right.
I'm gonna wipe my tears

322
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,550
and refocus.
That's in the past.

323
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:27,054
It's a whole new game.
All right.

324
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:31,433
Let's hand out the buffs.
( cheering )

325
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,144
>> All right.
>> PROBST: You guys are Ulong.

326
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:40,525
You wear blue.
Your tribe-- Karor.

327
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,612
You will wear brown.
Brown.

328
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:49,785
>> All right.
>> PROBST: Okay, so you're now

329
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,746
two tribes-- Ulong, Karor.
Two tribes still living

330
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:56,750
together on the same beach.
Head on back.

331
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,628
>> Get out of here.
>> Are you serious?

332
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,713
( laughing )
>> That's the plan.

333
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:18,814
>> I really thought you're
giving away the competition.

334
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:22,984
( laughing )
>> It's definitely going

335
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,945
to be weird,
all staying on one beach

336
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,947
together, though.
It's still coming through,

337
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,783
though.
>> It hurts to be last, but...

338
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:33,161
>> Oh, yeah.
I felt horrible

339
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,288
being picked last.
I didn't think that I was going

340
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,833
to be picked last.
>> How many girls we have, five?

341
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:41,670
>> I thought 100% that Coby
was going to pick me.

342
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,423
>> Five and four.
>> Five and four.

343
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,342
I don't feel like I'm on the
tribe that I should be on,

344
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,636
so there's no kindred feelings
with my tribe.

345
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:53,849
I'm the odd man out.
>> Never had anything

346
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,853
against you, ever.
>> Guys, if there's any sort

347
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,856
of competition
that they are trying to put

348
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,816
into this game already,
let's not be the ones

349
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,317
that start into that.
>> No, no, no.

350
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,028
>> Our average age is higher.
but let's try to weaken them

351
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,865
when it comes to physical stuff.
>> I'm altogether

352
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,826
very, very happy.
I wanted a wise tribe, if I had

353
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,536
the opportunity to pick.
We got a little bit of the

354
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,706
older folks, which I really
like, and we're up against a

355
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,708
bunch of the young bucks.
You compare the tribes and you

356
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,668
see a definite difference.
They come to you

357
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,587
and say, oh, listen,
so and so on your team

358
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,755
was talking about you...
they are just trying

359
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:26,756
to break us up.
>> I love everybody

360
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,551
on this team.
>> We definitely have

361
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,553
some kind of advantage,
which I don't care

362
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,847
what you say, you know,
smart's in it, too, but

363
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,266
athletics is going to play
a part in it, also.

364
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:51,948
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys.
You guys ready to get

365
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,784
to the challenge?
>> ALL: Yeah.

366
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,537
>> PROBST: It is both reward
and immunity.

367
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,915
Here's how it works.
Both tribes are going

368
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,210
to compete head-to-head
in a jungle obstacle course.

369
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,711
You'll make your way
through a net maze

370
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:07,214
and then through
a series of tires.

371
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,758
You'll reach a covered supply
dump, where you will find

372
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,219
a set of paddles
you must take tied

373
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,763
to four survival items
you can choose

374
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:18,099
to take or leave behind.
Fire in the form of flint,

375
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,728
two cans to carry water,
flour and rice for your food

376
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:24,356
and a tarp for shelter,
but the crates

377
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,983
that these items are in
have been weighted to make them

378
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,653
very heavy to carry.
Untie all of your items,

379
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:32,280
continue through the course
carrying the items.

380
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,992
You'll go up and over a wall,
through a jungle swamp.

381
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:38,328
When you reach your canoe,
drop the items you chose

382
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,121
to take with you,
get in the canoe,

383
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,124
paddle out to retrieve a flag
and race back to shore.

384
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,793
The first tribe
to get back to their mat

385
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,170
with all nine tribe members
and their tribe-colored flag

386
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:51,132
wins immunity and all the items
they carried to that mat,

387
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,969
keeping in mind you can only win
the items that make it

388
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,846
all the way to the finish.
So, it becomes a choice.

389
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,641
You want to win
to guarantee yourself immunity,

390
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:03,520
but you want to win
with as many items as possible.

391
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:04,854
Now let's get to immunity.
Ian, Jolanda,

392
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:08,233
you can you take those off.
Like I said, those guaranteed

393
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,360
you'd stay in the game
ten more minutes.

394
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:14,155
Those ten minutes are over.
This is what you covet now.

395
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,036
Immunity-- the only thing
that keeps you safe in this game

396
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,663
is this.
As long as you have it,

397
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,957
you can't be voted out.
Take your spots

398
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,670
and wait for my go.
Here we go.

399
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:33,675
For immunity and reward.
Survivors, ready...

400
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:40,098
Go!
Tom with a big head start.

401
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:46,771
Neck and neck right now.
Tom the first one over

402
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:50,191
for Koror,
followed by Gregg.

403
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,862
Here comes Jeff for Ulong.
>> Come on, come on, come on!

404
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,864
>> PROBST: There's Ian for
Koror.

405
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,867
We're tight.
There's Jenn.

406
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,662
Koror got a bit of a lead.
Here comes Caryn for Ulong.

407
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:06,041
Ulong in one fell swoop
catches up.

408
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:11,463
>> Come on, let's go, guys!
>> PROBST: Ulong moving on.

409
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:18,803
Koror, go!
Up and over, however you want.

410
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:23,850
Neck and neck still.
>> Come on!

411
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,852
>> PROBST: Start pulling those
off.

412
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,771
You gotta move all your items
to the mat before you can

413
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:30,774
start untying them.
>> Let's go, guys.

414
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:34,736
>> PROBST: Get that last item,
Koror.

415
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:38,031
Ulong, start untying.
This is where you

416
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:40,408
make your first decision.
Are you going to take

417
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:44,913
all your items or not.
Koror working together well.

418
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:50,835
Koror, very close.
Koror is free.

419
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:56,216
Koror is leaving
their food and their water,

420
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:59,260
taking only their fire
with them.

421
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,929
>> You guys, come on!
We gotta go.

422
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:09,437
>> We're gonna lose.
>> I'm telling you,

423
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,773
I think we should go.
You guys, finish it up.

424
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,942
We gotta go.
>> Oh, my God.

425
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:17,654
>> PROBST: Ulong, keep it
moving.

426
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:22,784
Koror first to the wall.
>> Two people push me

427
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,995
up that wall.
One, two, three.

428
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,792
>> Come on!
>> This way, this way.

429
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,795
>> Come on!
You got it, Ulong!

430
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,922
>> Get out of the way.
Ahh!

431
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:40,635
No...
>> Try jumping down.

432
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:42,011
>> PROBST: Here comes Ulong
right on your tail.

433
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,806
Koror having trouble
getting Willard over.

434
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:49,686
Ulong brought food
and water, did not bring fire.

435
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:54,566
Interesting strategy.
Koror is up and over.

436
00:28:56,067 --> 00:29:01,531
Koror, go.
Ulong really struggling.

437
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:04,033
Koror making their way
through the swamp

438
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:08,496
with a big lead.
( grunts and groans )

439
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,876
Ulong finally over the wall.
Koror first to their canoe.

440
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:16,713
The strategy was
to only bring fire,

441
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,007
and it's working so far.
Paddle out.

442
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:23,011
Get your flag.
Come on.

443
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:26,556
>> PROBST:
Let's go, Ulong!

444
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,016
Keep it moving.
You're still in this.

445
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:31,686
Get in, get in.
The rest up front.

446
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:36,316
Ulong, go.
Paddle out.

447
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,027
Hustle up, guys.
Good paddlers might

448
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:45,867
be able to catch them.
>> Get to that side.

449
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,037
Right side paddle backwards.
>> To the right side!

450
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,207
>> Paddle faster.
>> Paddle on the right.

451
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,919
>> PROBST: Koror still with
a big with a big lead.

452
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:59,214
>> Left to right side.
You'll get taken off to do it.

453
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,381
Right side.
>> That's good,

454
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,550
that's good.
All right, now listen,

455
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,053
both sides.
>> Turn it around.

456
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,722
>> We're going the wrong way.
>> PROBST: Ulong,

457
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:12,936
the flag is that way.
( indistinct shouting )

458
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:17,941
>> Guys, let's freakin' paddle!
Ulong is looking for

459
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:23,071
another island.
>> Go. Go.

460
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:28,826
>> PROBST: Koror working
together, straight,

461
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:33,540
strong, fast.
>> Come on!

462
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:36,626
Come on!
>> Come on!

463
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:39,212
>> PROBST: Ulong having a heck
of a time paddling.

464
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,631
>> Too many people on one side.
>> PROBST: Frustration setting

465
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:47,053
in for Ulong.
>> We're going to get it.

466
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:54,060
( whooping )
>> Whoo!

467
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,104
>> Whoo!
>> PROBST: Koror wins immunity

468
00:30:56,187 --> 00:31:02,944
and reward!
>> Yeah!

469
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:06,948
( whooping )
>> Good strategy.

470
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,122
>> PROBST: All right, Koror,
nice strategy.

471
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:19,127
You chose to only bring fire.
You can boil water with that.

472
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,547
You can cook food with that.
Okay, here's immunity.

473
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:26,175
Yes, yes, yes!
You are safe from

474
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,678
the vote tonight.
One other decision.

475
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,805
Because you won,
you get a choice.

476
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:34,058
The two tribes will no longer
be living together on one beach.

477
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:39,647
You can either go back
to what you know

478
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,482
and the shelter
you help build,

479
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,193
or this is a map
to a new unknown beach

480
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:48,197
where you can start fresh.
>> But why see a beach

481
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,658
we already saw?
Let's go see something new.

482
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,661
>> New adventure.
>> PROBST: You're going

483
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,372
to take your chances.
>> We'll take our chances.

484
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,498
>> PROBST: Give up what you know
for the unknown.

485
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,166
>> Yes, we are.
>> PROBST: Here's your map

486
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,794
to your new home.
>> Yeah!

487
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:05,548
>> PROBST: Ulong, good news is,
you're going home.

488
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,424
You're taking your
outrigger canoe with you.

489
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:09,677
Bad news is,
you're get some much-needed

490
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,138
practice when you paddle
to Tribal Council tonight

491
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,515
and officially vote out
the first member.

492
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:24,609
Get your stuff, head on out.
>> After the challenge,

493
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:30,740
Get your stuff, head on out.
>> After the challenge,

494
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:33,034
we were so excited.
We won immunity,

495
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,703
and we won the stuff
that we needed to make fire.

496
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:40,750
We were so the underdog.
Winning that was huge for us.

497
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:58,017
( indistinct chatter )
This wave came,

498
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:01,229
and we went over.
I don't know what the deal was

499
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,398
with, you know,
who was leaning what way

500
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,233
or what, but I think
it was just a combination

501
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,192
of all forces,
and we just went down.

502
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:09,362
All of the supplies
to make fire

503
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,447
were in this heavy
steel container

504
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,867
that went straight down.
It was just like,

505
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:19,580
did this really happen?
>> I thought I saw something,

506
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,249
but hell, I don't know.
It may be right there.

507
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,669
>> We were so elated
the ride back in the canoe,

508
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,587
we were just loving life
and couldn't wait

509
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,257
to see the new beach.
And all this to happen,

510
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,593
we're just crushed right now.
And we don't have the water,

511
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,220
we don't have the flint
to start a fire to boil

512
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:38,766
the water and purify it.
We lost everything we won today.

513
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:43,688
We're in a worse scenario
than we originally had.

514
00:33:57,326 --> 00:34:00,288
>> We lost to the challenge,
and we lost pretty hard.

515
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:04,333
The other tribe outplayed us
and outwitted us completely.

516
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,295
You know what,
we didn't make smart decisions.

517
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,297
They were smart,
they took just the fire.

518
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:13,134
>> The coconuts will sustain us
for 39 days if we had to.

519
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,261
So understand that--
I'm not going to allow

520
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:18,931
anyone to be negative.
>> Nobody needs to be negative.

521
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,016
>> Okay. No, no, about, "Oh,
we don't have this.

522
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,477
We got everything we need."
>> I know how things work.

523
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,229
I'm not the strongest person.
You know, people are gonna

524
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:29,150
choose who doesn't fit into this
and who they think

525
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,819
is a weak link.
So I definitely think

526
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:37,492
that I am a target.
>> But when it comes

527
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,285
to challenges, physically,
I know I'm stronger

528
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:42,872
than most of their dudes.
Well, let's keep on

529
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,332
what we was doing.
We're gonna do Angie...

530
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,334
>> Right. We're gonna do Angie.
But we got to get

531
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:49,629
the other guys to go in on it.
I want to go talk to Stephenie,

532
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,714
'cause we have issues.
If we have issues,

533
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:55,510
we need to work them out.
>> My vote will be for Angie

534
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,220
not because I don't like her,
but she is a person that

535
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,347
must be voted off
in order for our team

536
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:05,937
to be as strong as it can be.
>> So you think Angie.

537
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,396
>> I think we need
to keep the men.

538
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,148
I think it's absolutely...
>> We're keeping the men.

539
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,859
We can't lose any of our guys.
Which, I mean, seriously, I

540
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,403
mean, I-I could be voted off.
I don't want to be voted off.

541
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:18,032
I think the team needs me.
>> We need your strength.

542
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:19,325
But I do have to say,
we should've left earlier.

543
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,828
Yeah, you're right,
you're right, you're right.

544
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,372
I know that you're just
a complete go-getter,

545
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,207
and that's why you want us
to get everything,

546
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,376
and I understand that.
So I guess Angie.

547
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,460
>> Okay.
>> Okay. You, too.

548
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:33,673
>> Absolutely.
>> Okay.

549
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:36,384
Nervous as hell about Tribal.
Wish I wasn't going tonight.

550
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,386
We made a dumb mistake,
and I don't think

551
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,389
we should be going tonight.
But we are, and it's because

552
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:48,396
of one person, I feel.
The only reason

553
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,438
we lost the challenge
'cause we didn't

554
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,232
leave soon enough.
>> We didn't leave soon enough.

555
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,442
>> She wanted everything.
I don't think

556
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,611
we need to get rid of her.
I'm not gonna vote for her.

557
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,322
Stephenie's thinking
that Jolanda's the reason

558
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,241
we lost the challenge.
But that woman's got a lot,

559
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:04,078
a lot of strength.
I think she can still

560
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:05,872
help us out.
I haven't seen where

561
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,290
she's hurting us just yet.
>> Who do you want to vote for?

562
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,250
>> I think Angie right now.
>> She's not fit?

563
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,252
>> Yeah, yeah.
>> All right.

564
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,255
Well, I don't know, I'm sorry.
( laughs )

565
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:19,093
>> No, that's good, that's good.
>> I'll go with you.

566
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:21,429
>> Okay, news flash, news
flash.

567
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,471
This is something
that I noticed.

568
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:26,100
For every two hours, that we
work, we're gonna rest

569
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:31,480
for at least an hour, okay?
It is time for us to get

570
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,983
focused, kick butt
and take names.

571
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:37,445
>> Jolanda is a strong
personality.

572
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,948
She is not a team player.
I didn't know that

573
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,950
that's how you guys felt.
>> Right.

574
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,244
>> I thought I was the only one.
Are you down with that?

575
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,787
Are you in?
>> Yeah.

576
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,956
>> Because I'll be pissed
if everybody changes their mind.

577
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,292
I mean, I'll hold it
against you for life.

578
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,376
>> Now she says,
"We're voting out Jo.

579
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,754
Are you in?"
I was, like,

580
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,631
"Hell, yeah, I'm in."
Like, I'm thinking

581
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,382
I'm the one out, like
I know how today went.

582
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,469
You don't think I remember
exactly the order

583
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,597
in which we got picked
for tribes?

584
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,349
I don't trust anyone
in this tribe.

585
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,101
But if I can at least
make it past this one,

586
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:19,153
I'll be happy.
>> PROBST: Behind each of you

587
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:37,046
I'll be happy.
>> PROBST: Behind each of you

588
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,547
is a torch.
Go ahead and grab a torch.

589
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:41,509
Approach a flame,
dip it in and get fire.

590
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:47,640
This is part of the ritual
of Tribal Council.

591
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,392
In this game,
fire represents your life.

592
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,352
As long as you have fire,
you're still in the game.

593
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,188
When your fire's gone,
so are you.

594
00:37:54,271 --> 00:38:00,861
Have a seat.
Well, welcome to your first

595
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,656
Tribal Council.
I know you don't want

596
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,241
to be here.
Stephenie,

597
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,243
what's been the biggest surprise
first three days?

598
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,745
>> Biggest surprise?
Oh, God.

599
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,748
Starving,
we can't get fire,

600
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,042
we're so thirsty.
We were together as one,

601
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,836
and now we're separated,
we've formed bonds

602
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:19,880
and now they're gone,
and we don't know

603
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,008
what's coming next.
It's been really tough.

604
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,260
>> PROBST: James.
Happy with this tribe?

605
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:28,389
>> I am.
This is a damn fine tribe.

606
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,017
Everybody in here is tough,
they're young, they

607
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,436
got a lot of energy,
lot of testosterone.

608
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:38,482
We gonna win some matches.
We just didn't do it today.

609
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,861
>> PROBST: Jeff, let's talk
about the strategy

610
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,612
of today's challenge,
because it was about

611
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:47,366
making a choice.
And it seems as though

612
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,910
you guys have
a very strong tribe,

613
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,038
but it was brains
that beat you today.

614
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,706
Would you agree?
>> Yeah.

615
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:56,292
We've got the strength,
we all have the endurance.

616
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,252
There was just
a couple key times

617
00:38:58,335 --> 00:39:00,046
that we just messed up,
and, you know,

618
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,922
we lost time trying
to get everything

619
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,717
we possibly could
and get running with it,

620
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,762
and... it wasn't gonna happen.
>> PROBST: So, James,

621
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,473
let me be clear.
You didn't even bring fire.

622
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,475
Oh, hell, no.
We should've.

623
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:15,269
You did not take fire?
>> Dumb-ass.

624
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:16,562
>> Well, we tried to get it,
but it was last,

625
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:20,441
and then when we realized that
we just lost a tremendous

626
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,276
amount of time,
we just said, okay,

627
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:23,694
just take the other stuff.
>> PROBST: Ashlee, is there a

628
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:28,074
leader on this tribe yet?
>> Jeff, I think that is...

629
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:31,118
the only thing
that's holding this group back,

630
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:35,289
is that we have yet to come
together as a group

631
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,459
and decide who is gonna lead
our group right now.

632
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,461
>> PROBST: Jolanda, can
this group lead itself...

633
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,838
as a group?
>> Uh, no.

634
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,966
We need somebody
to make a unilateral decision.

635
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,843
I mean, I would like,
if I could,

636
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:50,679
to help lead the team.
But I also know that I have

637
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:51,555
a very strong personality.
So, that's been

638
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,934
my biggest dilemma,
because I don't want

639
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,435
for people to say,
"Oh, you know,

640
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,771
"her personality's
too strong, she's bossy,

641
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:01,690
she's a... a witch."
>> PROBST: Angie, picked last,

642
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:05,319
tribe welcomes you,
but now here we are

643
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:07,988
at Tribal Council,
and you were still picked last.

644
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,156
>> Yep.
>> PROBST: How heavy is that

645
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,659
weighing on your mind?
Or have you overcome that?

646
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:16,163
>> It weighs very heavy on my
mind. I mean, it's hard

647
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,999
being picked last.
But I think that I tried

648
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,793
really, really hard
at the challenge today,

649
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,545
but I think
definitely, my head was gonna be

650
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,672
on the chopping block.
You know, either there's

651
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,967
some things going on
where somebody has

652
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,052
somebody else in mind,
or it's just...

653
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,721
it's gonna overwhelmingly be me,
so...

654
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,682
>> PROBST: We'll find out.
It is time to vote.

655
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:47,695
Jolanda, you're up.
>> Um, Angie,

656
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:51,365
I just don't think that we can
be happy with losses.

657
00:40:51,448 --> 00:40:54,952
We've got to evaluate
and move forward.

658
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,234
>> ( whispers ):
It's nothing personal,

659
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:31,155
but it's either you or I,
and I don't want it to be me.

660
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,622
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.

661
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,719
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

662
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,387
The person voted out
will be asked to leave the

663
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,057
Tribal Council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.

664
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:04,772
First vote.
Angie.

665
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,986
Jolanda-- one vote Angie,
one vote Jolanda.

666
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,866
Angie-- two votes Angie,
one vote Jolanda.

667
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,456
Angie.
That's three votes Angie,

668
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:26,627
one vote Jolanda.
Jolanda.

669
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,214
Three votes Angie,
two votes Jolanda.

670
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:37,471
Jolanda.
We're tied: three votes Angie,

671
00:42:37,554 --> 00:42:42,142
three votes Jolanda.
That's four votes Jolanda.

672
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:49,316
First person voted out
of Survivor: Palau--

673
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,193
Jolanda.
That's five votes,

674
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,946
that's enough.
You need to bring me your torch.

675
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:59,827
>> Good luck, you guys.
Watch the way.

676
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:06,917
>> PROBST: Jolanda, the
tribe has spoken.

677
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:17,720
It's time for you to go.
Well, if there's one thing

678
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:24,601
It's time for you to go.
Well, if there's one thing

679
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,229
you should take away
from tonight's Tribal Council,

680
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,315
it should be this:
You need to stop

681
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,357
with the excuses
and get a plan, or you will

682
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,568
be back here very soon.
You're not gonna be going

683
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:34,320
back to camp
with fire; you're gonna

684
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:38,574
earn that on your own.
Go back to camp. Good night.

685
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,964
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

686
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,553
>> PROBST: Next time on
<i>Survivor...</i>

687
00:43:59,636 --> 00:44:02,431
( woman screams )
>> Oh, my God, there were three!

688
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:05,059
( thunderclap )
>> Oh, no!

689
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,894
>> PROBST: ...Koror questions
the move to the new beach.

690
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:07,895
>> Do you think there
could be a worse

691
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,064
island than this?
>> PROBST: At Ulong,

692
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:13,067
Jeff and Kim get cozy,
and the search

693
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,695
for flint intensifies.
>> Fire is the only thing

694
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:22,951
that matters.
>> I played this game,

695
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,953
and I don't think
that I would do

696
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,206
anything differently.
I mean, I am the oldest,

697
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,375
and I think differently
than my tribe.

698
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:32,211
They are a lot more
happy-go-lucky than I am,

699
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,755
but that's fine, because
this was a great adventure,

700
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:39,009
and it's an experience that
I think everyone should try,

701
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:42,137
and I don't regret
anything that happened out here.
