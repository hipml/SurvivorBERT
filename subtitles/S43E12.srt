1
00:00:14,862 --> 00:00:17,522
He sure did. I would have
expected nothing less.

2
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,830
Love that kid,
but he was a loose cannon.

3
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:22,281
<i>Tribal Council was,</i>

4
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:23,759
uh, exciting.

5
00:00:23,862 --> 00:00:25,692
Sami decided
to play his Shot in the Dark,

6
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:27,903
<i>and he ended up going home.</i>

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,475
- The tribe has spoken.
- Thank you, brother.

8
00:00:29,517 --> 00:00:31,307
<i>I am a tad</i>

9
00:00:31,413 --> 00:00:34,723
disappointed, though,
because the plan going in was

10
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:36,827
<i>for Karla to vote for Cassidy
and end up</i>

11
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:39,721
<i>with some egg on her face,
but Karla realized</i>

12
00:00:39,827 --> 00:00:42,657
that voting for Cassidy
could leave her exposed,

13
00:00:42,758 --> 00:00:44,718
<i>so she decided
to flip her vote to Sami</i>

14
00:00:44,827 --> 00:00:46,897
when he blew things up
with his Shot in the Dark.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,760
All you had to do
was vote the right way

16
00:00:50,862 --> 00:00:52,692
and your ass
would still be here.

17
00:00:52,793 --> 00:00:55,523
<i>So, my goal moving forward is</i>

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,520
<i>to drive a wedge
between Cassidy and Karla</i>

19
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,690
<i>just to reinforce that idea</i>

20
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,173
that Karla is dangerous,

21
00:01:01,275 --> 00:01:03,375
she's astute
and she needs to go.

22
00:01:04,862 --> 00:01:06,792
<i>I'm so glad you made it.</i>

23
00:01:06,896 --> 00:01:08,233
I know. I think
I was a little worried

24
00:01:08,275 --> 00:01:09,854
that, like, Cody
might throw a vote on me.

25
00:01:09,896 --> 00:01:12,476
Mm-hmm.
Well, see, I-I... I think

26
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:14,826
Karla maybe would have
taken a shot at you.

27
00:01:14,931 --> 00:01:17,071
That's what... that's what
Sami was trying to tell me.

28
00:01:17,172 --> 00:01:20,102
- I don't know
if it's true or not, but...
- Oh.

29
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:21,889
She's trying to...
I think what she's trying to do

30
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:24,691
- is put the target
off of her onto me.
- Yes.

31
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,933
<i>Wow.
From what I'm hearing,</i>

32
00:01:27,034 --> 00:01:28,647
Karla was actually
targeting me last night.

33
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,475
<i>If that's the case,
I'm gonna be pretty pissed</i>

34
00:01:30,517 --> 00:01:32,717
<i>because me and Karla have been
together since day one.</i>

35
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:35,237
- So she was gonna vote me?
- Oh, yeah. That's what I heard.

36
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:37,484
- Wow.
- That's what Jesse was saying.

37
00:01:37,586 --> 00:01:38,826
<i>This game is</i>

38
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:40,281
so tricky. Like,

39
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:41,958
<i>I don't know
if Owen's telling the truth.</i>

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,030
<i>People are good liars out here,
but I think I would be</i>

41
00:01:45,137 --> 00:01:48,167
<i>naive not to question it
and see, like,</i>

42
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,965
if she really was targeting me.

43
00:01:53,275 --> 00:01:55,065
I think that's... crazy

44
00:01:55,172 --> 00:01:59,522
because, clearly, I've been
voting with you since day one.

45
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,170
That would be a pretty big move

46
00:02:01,275 --> 00:02:02,995
to take out
your number-one ally.

47
00:02:03,103 --> 00:02:05,213
But it wouldn't
make sense for me.

48
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,550
That would be stupid.

49
00:02:07,655 --> 00:02:09,305
<i>Oh, man. Cassidy was like,</i>

50
00:02:09,413 --> 00:02:10,973
"I think you were
coming for me."

51
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:12,716
And I was like, "What are you
talking about? No, I wasn't."

52
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:13,998
But I was.

53
00:02:14,103 --> 00:02:15,343
<i>And the truth is,</i>

54
00:02:15,448 --> 00:02:16,682
<i>I would like for her to go home.</i>

55
00:02:16,724 --> 00:02:17,764
What are you thinking?

56
00:02:20,448 --> 00:02:23,758
- Really? Is this...
is this real?
- Uh, yes. Cass.

57
00:02:23,862 --> 00:02:25,932
I've never said your name, Cass.

58
00:02:26,034 --> 00:02:28,034
- Ever.
- Okay.

59
00:02:28,137 --> 00:02:31,657
I don't know what to tell you,
because that's the truth.

60
00:02:31,758 --> 00:02:34,098
I cannot say, "Yeah,
I was about to vote you out,"

61
00:02:34,206 --> 00:02:37,026
<i>because she's the only one
that knows about my idol, but</i>

62
00:02:37,137 --> 00:02:39,207
I'm picking up that
she's not buying it.

63
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,660
<i>So the only thing I could
think of at that moment was cry.</i>

64
00:02:42,758 --> 00:02:45,968
<i>But if this has to become
a soap opera, I'm ready for it.</i>

65
00:02:46,068 --> 00:02:47,998
<i>Let's make it
a telenovela tonight.</i>

66
00:02:48,103 --> 00:02:49,406
Your body language
is just telling me

67
00:02:49,448 --> 00:02:50,658
that you want me to go home.

68
00:02:50,758 --> 00:02:52,068
No. I just... I'm hurt

69
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,792
because I heard that
you were coming for me.

70
00:02:54,896 --> 00:02:57,476
I'm hurt that you would...

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,210
Sorry.

72
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:07,213
I just feel like
I've been so loyal to you.

73
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,923
- That's why-that's why I'm hurt.
- And I saved...

74
00:03:08,965 --> 00:03:11,065
I've saved you twice.

75
00:03:11,172 --> 00:03:13,102
Ask Jesse.

76
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:15,406
He'll tell you.

77
00:03:15,517 --> 00:03:18,337
I was, like, crying. Like,

78
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,854
"I can't believe
you think I'd write..."

79
00:03:19,896 --> 00:03:21,546
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- I'm so stupid.

80
00:03:21,655 --> 00:03:25,305
I need an Emmy after that
performance. Yeah, go talk

81
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,095
- to her. She's over there
by herself.
- She stretching?

82
00:03:27,137 --> 00:03:30,407
Yeah. Just be like,
"I saw you and Karla talking."

83
00:03:30,517 --> 00:03:32,307
I don't know.
Or, like, you seem...

84
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:33,693
Okay.

85
00:03:33,793 --> 00:03:35,863
<i>Cass is hearing things</i>

86
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,405
<i>about Karla targeting her,
and so Karla told her like,</i>

87
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:39,827
<i>"Check with Jesse. He'll verify</i>

88
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:41,521
<i>that, like,
I was voting with you."</i>

89
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,620
I want the rift.
I want that pay-per-view match.

90
00:03:50,724 --> 00:03:53,454
I want, like, you know, those
two to be targeting each other.

91
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,928
But... Yeah.

92
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:00,341
<i>Karla's good.
She laid it on so thick</i>

93
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,168
with the tears and everything,
trying to convince me

94
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:05,275
<i>that she had been loyal
to me since day one.</i>

95
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,789
<i>But I feel like
the bridge between Karla's</i>

96
00:04:07,896 --> 00:04:09,751
<i>pretty much been burned.
I want to get Karla out.</i>

97
00:04:09,793 --> 00:04:11,593
Like, Karla, I'm coming for you.

98
00:04:22,034 --> 00:04:23,174
Come on in!

99
00:04:23,275 --> 00:04:26,025
- Oh, my God.
- Oh. God.

100
00:04:26,137 --> 00:04:28,997
- Yeah, I knew it. Oh!
- Yikes.

101
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,663
- Yes.
- Wow.

102
00:04:31,758 --> 00:04:33,378
- Hi, Jeff.
- Good morning.

103
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,342
- Jeff.
- Ooh. Day 22.

104
00:04:35,448 --> 00:04:38,658
Six players,
two from each original tribe.

105
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:40,068
I mean, come on.

106
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:41,722
Look at that.

107
00:04:41,827 --> 00:04:44,587
All right, are you ready to get
to today's reward challenge?

108
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:46,209
Yes, sir.

109
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,380
For today's challenge,
we're gonna randomly divide

110
00:04:49,482 --> 00:04:51,032
into two teams of three.

111
00:04:51,137 --> 00:04:55,717
<i>One player will be strapped
inside a giant ball.</i>

112
00:04:55,827 --> 00:04:57,587
<i>They will guide their two</i>

113
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:00,479
- blindfolded teammates...
- Wow.

114
00:05:00,586 --> 00:05:04,376
<i>Through a long, winding course</i>

115
00:05:04,482 --> 00:05:06,662
<i>to a table maze,
where the player</i>

116
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:08,478
<i>still strapped inside the ball</i>

117
00:05:08,586 --> 00:05:12,096
<i>will guide the still-blindfolded
teammates</i>

118
00:05:12,206 --> 00:05:15,756
<i>as they race to solve that maze.</i>

119
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:17,932
First team to finish
wins reward.

120
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:20,214
Want to know
what you're playing for?

121
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,509
The winning three will be taken

122
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:24,031
to the sanctuary,
where good things happen.

123
00:05:24,137 --> 00:05:27,967
- Waiting for you...
iced coffee and iced tea.
- Ooh.

124
00:05:28,068 --> 00:05:29,820
And you need something
to go along with that.

125
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,792
How about an array of pastries?

126
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:33,786
- Ah.
- Oh, nice.
- Donuts,

127
00:05:33,896 --> 00:05:37,476
- croissants, muffins.
- Oh, my God.

128
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:39,130
- Ooh.
- Hell, yeah.
- Worth playing for?

129
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,552
- Yes.
- All right.

130
00:05:40,655 --> 00:05:41,854
We're gonna draw for teams,
we'll get started.

131
00:05:41,896 --> 00:05:42,796
Let's do it.

132
00:05:49,965 --> 00:05:52,275
All right,
we have our two teams.

133
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:55,929
In blue, strapped
in the ball is Owen.

134
00:05:56,034 --> 00:05:58,104
We've got Cody
and Karla blindfolded.

135
00:05:58,206 --> 00:05:59,476
They will be pushing.

136
00:05:59,586 --> 00:06:01,926
In Red, it is Cassidy
strapped in the ball

137
00:06:02,034 --> 00:06:03,864
with Jesse
and Gabler blindfolded.

138
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:07,585
Here we go. For reward.
Survivors ready?

139
00:06:09,344 --> 00:06:10,794
- Go.
- Go, go, go, go.

140
00:06:10,896 --> 00:06:12,856
Who will get
through this first gate first?

141
00:06:12,965 --> 00:06:14,655
- It's gonna be Blue.
- There we go.

142
00:06:14,758 --> 00:06:15,992
A little less.
A little more, Karla.

143
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:18,314
Karla, more.
Karla, more.

144
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:20,406
Keep going forward. Forward.
Now to the... to the right.

145
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:23,858
Cassidy upside down now
and running into Karla.

146
00:06:23,965 --> 00:06:25,235
- Stop, stop, stop.
- Rotate.

147
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:27,034
- Which way?
- You got to get through

148
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,717
that tiny little gateway.

149
00:06:28,827 --> 00:06:30,927
Stop. Forward. Forward.

150
00:06:31,034 --> 00:06:33,074
There goes Blue. Here comes Red.

151
00:06:33,172 --> 00:06:35,972
- Owen is leading.
- Forward. Left, left, left.

152
00:06:36,068 --> 00:06:37,828
Left. There you go. Beautiful.

153
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:39,621
Forward left.
A little more left.

154
00:06:39,724 --> 00:06:41,544
- That's how you do it!
- Here we go. 12:00 o'clock.

155
00:06:41,586 --> 00:06:43,586
12:00 o'clock. Doing great.

156
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:45,716
Okay, straight. We got to hurry.
Move forward. Okay.

157
00:06:45,758 --> 00:06:48,968
It is Cassidy,
Jesse and Gabler behind.

158
00:06:49,068 --> 00:06:51,168
You got to get through
another passageway now.

159
00:06:51,275 --> 00:06:53,925
- Communication is key.
- Forward. Push, push, push.
- Forward.

160
00:06:54,034 --> 00:06:55,724
Straight on. Straight on.
Straight on.

161
00:06:55,827 --> 00:06:58,337
- Blue is through!
- Straight on, straight on,
straight on.

162
00:06:58,448 --> 00:07:00,618
- Keep going straight.
- Owen now on

163
00:07:00,724 --> 00:07:02,647
- to the big part of the course.
- Right. Now we're taking

164
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,379
a hard right. 3:00 o'clock.

165
00:07:04,482 --> 00:07:06,552
Or more like 2:30.
There we go.

166
00:07:06,655 --> 00:07:09,545
- Owen doing a nice job
of communicating...
- Good job, bro.

167
00:07:09,655 --> 00:07:11,825
- To Cody and Karla
- Yup. Now we're gonna brake.

168
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,691
As he goes upside down,

169
00:07:13,793 --> 00:07:15,343
- left and right, sideways.
- Yeah.

170
00:07:15,448 --> 00:07:17,406
Oh, my God. Got to go, uh, to
the right. To the right, guys.

171
00:07:17,448 --> 00:07:20,138
- Red is hung up.
- You guys both got
to get behind me!

172
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:22,031
Keep going...
No, no, wrong way, other way.

173
00:07:22,137 --> 00:07:23,927
- Oh, this way.
- Got it?

174
00:07:24,034 --> 00:07:25,475
Cassidy is now maneuvering
around that obstacle,

175
00:07:25,517 --> 00:07:28,167
and they are through.

176
00:07:28,275 --> 00:07:29,545
Pull it towards Cody.

177
00:07:29,655 --> 00:07:31,655
- Over the sawdust?
- Yup. Uh, not quite.

178
00:07:31,758 --> 00:07:33,199
You'll be there in, like,
four steps. Watch your feet.

179
00:07:33,241 --> 00:07:36,861
Owen with a nice lead for Blue.

180
00:07:36,965 --> 00:07:39,375
- Uh.
- There we go.
Now we're through the sawdust.

181
00:07:39,482 --> 00:07:40,613
- To the right.
- To the right.

182
00:07:40,655 --> 00:07:43,065
You got to get behind! Go!

183
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:46,172
Red once again struggling to
get through another passageway.

184
00:07:46,275 --> 00:07:47,675
- Pull back?
- Pull back, pull back.

185
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,026
Now-now push forward
to your right, to your right.

186
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,208
Yes. Yeah. Yes, yes.

187
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,716
Red is back on the move.
- Keep going.

188
00:07:52,758 --> 00:07:54,268
Here we go. Watch out, Cody.
Watch out, watch out.

189
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,061
- Are we at the-the base?
- We're at the gate.

190
00:07:56,103 --> 00:07:58,383
Owen doing a nice job,
calm communicating.

191
00:07:58,482 --> 00:08:00,312
- Now push it?
- Now push me over.

192
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,213
Got to get him up on that
platform and then you're good.

193
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,760
So we got to rotate
180 degrees around. Clockwise.

194
00:08:05,862 --> 00:08:07,889
Now Owen needs to be able
to see that maze so he can tell

195
00:08:07,931 --> 00:08:10,381
Cody and Karla what to do.
Nice job by Blue.

196
00:08:10,482 --> 00:08:13,312
- Okay.
- Owen is straight up.

197
00:08:13,413 --> 00:08:15,061
That's about as good
as it gets right there.

198
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,003
Down. You're at it.

199
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:18,933
This is the last part
of this challenge.

200
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:21,384
- Cody, pull up.
- Get that white ball

201
00:08:21,482 --> 00:08:23,072
from one corner to the other.

202
00:08:23,172 --> 00:08:26,622
Up. Cody, up.
Karla, stay where you are. Okay.

203
00:08:26,724 --> 00:08:29,664
Stay there. Yes. Now forward.
Forward. A little to the left.

204
00:08:29,758 --> 00:08:31,889
- Stay where you. A little
to the left, now forward.
- Here comes Red

205
00:08:31,931 --> 00:08:33,341
trying to stay in it.

206
00:08:33,448 --> 00:08:35,618
Towards Karla, hard.

207
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,214
- Beautiful.
- Owen has been calm

208
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,170
this entire challenge.

209
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:40,715
- One, two, three!
- Push up. Three.

210
00:08:40,827 --> 00:08:42,613
- Push. Oh,
to the right a little.
- To the right.

211
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:45,925
Red is lined up.
They come straight in.

212
00:08:46,034 --> 00:08:49,144
- Okay.
- Now Cassidy... can she see
from here is the question?

213
00:08:49,241 --> 00:08:50,578
- Are we in there?
- All right.
Yeah. Yeah, we're good.

214
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,340
- All right, go, go, go!
- She's gonna do it

215
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,820
- sideways.
- Where are you?
- To the right, to the right.

216
00:08:53,862 --> 00:08:55,312
Now Jesse and Gabler got to get

217
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:57,933
to the maze
and find their spots.

218
00:08:58,034 --> 00:09:00,414
- Both down.
- Blue has had
a lot of time now

219
00:09:00,517 --> 00:09:02,026
- to try to figure this out.
- Tell me...

220
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:03,068
I'll tell you when to go.

221
00:09:03,172 --> 00:09:04,662
Okay, we're going...

222
00:09:04,758 --> 00:09:06,168
We're going up now.
We're fine.

223
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:07,992
- We're going a different way.
- There you go, Gabler!

224
00:09:08,034 --> 00:09:10,244
Look at that.
Jesse and Gabler are here.

225
00:09:10,344 --> 00:09:12,264
- Okay. Yes. Now go up. Up.
- They're back in it.

226
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,280
- This challenge is on.
- Karla, down a bit.

227
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:16,449
All right, we're gonna make
a left turn

228
00:09:16,551 --> 00:09:18,001
so we're gonna go down
and then...

229
00:09:18,103 --> 00:09:20,243
Big reward on the line.
A visit to the sanctuary.

230
00:09:20,344 --> 00:09:21,544
Right, right,
right, right, right!

231
00:09:21,586 --> 00:09:22,613
- Right?
- Right. No, up, up, up, up.

232
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:23,895
Up, up. Yeah, good.

233
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It is a scorching
hot day in Fiji.

234
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:27,343
- Okay, go to the left.
- Left.

235
00:09:27,448 --> 00:09:29,278
This will be a nice break

236
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:31,419
- from the routine of camp now.
- To the left. Down.

237
00:09:31,517 --> 00:09:33,027
Up now, Cody. There we go.

238
00:09:33,137 --> 00:09:34,997
Blue with another nice move.

239
00:09:35,103 --> 00:09:37,833
They are closing in
on a victory right here.

240
00:09:37,931 --> 00:09:40,591
Down. Down to the left. Yes.
Here we go. Now up.

241
00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:43,549
Karla, start lifting up.
Gently, gently, gently.

242
00:09:43,655 --> 00:09:46,655
- Gently. A little more.
- Wow.
This is a nice touch

243
00:09:46,758 --> 00:09:48,716
- if they can pull it off.
- A little more. And now.

244
00:09:48,758 --> 00:09:50,758
- Up.
- They can't.

245
00:09:50,862 --> 00:09:53,592
And that opens the door
for Red now, who is gaining.

246
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:55,061
Down to the left, left, left!
There we go, there we go.

247
00:09:55,103 --> 00:09:56,833
Red is not far behind

248
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:58,716
- Blue right now.
- Lift, Cody.
Gently, gently.

249
00:09:58,758 --> 00:10:00,613
- Up, Cody, up, Cody.
- Blue losing more ground.

250
00:10:00,655 --> 00:10:02,685
Going backwards again.

251
00:10:02,793 --> 00:10:05,243
The door is open and we are
at the same spot in the maze.

252
00:10:05,344 --> 00:10:07,484
- Yes, yes. Here we go.
- Push. Go. Go, push.

253
00:10:07,586 --> 00:10:08,966
Hell yes. Okay.
We're right there.

254
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:10,338
Blue has made it.

255
00:10:10,448 --> 00:10:13,028
They're closer
than they have ever been.

256
00:10:13,137 --> 00:10:15,477
Just got to get it to drop
for the win.

257
00:10:15,586 --> 00:10:18,236
As soon as I say "up," you got
to go up, up, up, up, up, up!

258
00:10:18,344 --> 00:10:21,214
- Red right there.
- Down, Cody.
Give it more juice.

259
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,860
- Hard, Karla. Hard, Karla.
No! Other way.
- No!

260
00:10:23,965 --> 00:10:26,995
They miss the opportunity.
Can Red catch them?

261
00:10:27,103 --> 00:10:28,313
Up, up, up, up, up, up!

262
00:10:28,413 --> 00:10:30,033
So close!

263
00:10:30,137 --> 00:10:31,097
Pull towards you, Karla.

264
00:10:31,206 --> 00:10:32,586
Down and to the left.

265
00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:34,409
In and out again!

266
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:35,787
Up, up, up, up now!

267
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:37,856
Yeah, no. Okay.

268
00:10:37,965 --> 00:10:40,785
- Up, Cody. Up, Cody.
- Yes! There it is!

269
00:10:40,896 --> 00:10:42,446
Yes!

270
00:10:42,551 --> 00:10:45,381
- Yes. Oh, great job, y'all.
- Owen, Cody, Karla

271
00:10:45,482 --> 00:10:48,932
win reward...
A trip to the sanctuary.

272
00:10:49,034 --> 00:10:52,104
- Aah! Great job, y'all.
- Oh, my God! Great job.

273
00:10:52,206 --> 00:10:53,682
- Great job y'all.
Oh, my God.
- Damn it.

274
00:10:53,724 --> 00:10:56,694
- Elbows. Elbows.
- Oh, we were close.

275
00:10:56,793 --> 00:11:01,213
All right, Owen, Cody, Karla,

276
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,450
you're gonna leave here,
go directly to the sanctuary.

277
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,551
An array of pastries

278
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:09,275
fill your body
and lift your spirits.

279
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:10,829
Grab your stuff, head out.

280
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:12,901
- Boat'll pick you up.
- Thank you.
- See y'all.

281
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Enjoy the afternoon.
Well earned.

282
00:11:16,103 --> 00:11:17,863
- Thanks, Jeff. Ooh!
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

283
00:11:17,931 --> 00:11:19,651
Gabler, Cassidy, Jesse,
got nothing for you.

284
00:11:19,724 --> 00:11:21,524
Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.

285
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,170
Thank you.

286
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:25,235
<i>The reward challenge
was awesome.</i>

287
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:26,716
My hands and feet
were all strapped together,

288
00:11:26,758 --> 00:11:29,138
but I was like, "Yeah, let's go!
Yeah!" Like, I was

289
00:11:29,241 --> 00:11:31,211
<i>so fired up,
and now I'm thrilled</i>

290
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,170
<i>to come back to the sanctuary,
talk to Cody and Karla</i>

291
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:35,889
to take the pulse
of where their heads are at

292
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:38,101
going into this pivotal
final-six vote.

293
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,751
If you think you have what it
takes to come out here and play

294
00:11:45,793 --> 00:11:48,153
this game, what are you waiting
on? Apply to be on <i>Survivor.</i>

295
00:11:57,206 --> 00:11:59,546
I am sky-high right now.
Feels so good.

296
00:11:59,655 --> 00:12:01,015
I'm going to the top
with you guys.

297
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:03,208
- Yeah. To the moon, baby.
- Here I come.

298
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,030
Watch out.

299
00:12:05,137 --> 00:12:07,061
- Man, I don't even...
- To the moon, baby! To the top!

300
00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:08,523
<i>My body has not had</i>

301
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,410
caffeine, and to just send it,
like, on coffee and sugar

302
00:12:13,517 --> 00:12:14,997
<i>is out of control.</i>

303
00:12:15,103 --> 00:12:17,763
Say hello to my little friend.

304
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,342
<i>But I have to be careful.
We have six people left,</i>

305
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,338
<i>and money makes people
do funny things.</i>

306
00:12:22,448 --> 00:12:24,168
<i>Probably even more
than the caffeine</i>

307
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:25,785
<i>running through my brain.</i>

308
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:27,716
It's a very interesting time
in the game.

309
00:12:27,827 --> 00:12:29,307
I mean, we are down to six.

310
00:12:29,413 --> 00:12:31,073
- We are really getting
down to it.
- Yeah.

311
00:12:31,172 --> 00:12:33,592
It's kind of wild just
since we all voted together

312
00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:35,519
last night.

313
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,930
Yeah. Where those lines
kind of are then gonna fall.

314
00:12:39,034 --> 00:12:41,724
I feel like I have
a big target on my back.

315
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,820
- That's how I feel, honest...
to be honest, to be
- Really?

316
00:12:43,862 --> 00:12:45,242
Completely honest
with you, yeah.

317
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:47,554
<i>I'm a threat.
I know I'm a freaking threat.</i>

318
00:12:47,655 --> 00:12:49,233
You know, I've won
two immunity challenges.

319
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:50,785
The rumor is that I have an idol
because I actually

320
00:12:50,827 --> 00:12:52,337
<i>do have an idol.</i>

321
00:12:52,448 --> 00:12:55,548
<i>But I need people to believe
I don't have an idol.</i>

322
00:12:55,655 --> 00:12:57,925
<i>I'll do anything
to keep that target off my back.</i>

323
00:12:58,034 --> 00:13:00,524
I feel like everyone
is speculating about me,

324
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,240
that I have something.

325
00:13:02,344 --> 00:13:04,834
That's the hardest part
because I... don't.

326
00:13:06,103 --> 00:13:08,593
And...

327
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:12,239
I feel like it's been ruining
my game since the merge.

328
00:13:12,344 --> 00:13:14,794
- That sucks. Like, that sucks.
- That's a... It... Dude.

329
00:13:14,896 --> 00:13:16,164
You got that target
on your back,

330
00:13:16,206 --> 00:13:17,682
- and you can't even defend it.
- Cody,

331
00:13:17,724 --> 00:13:20,524
it's been a target
every single vote.

332
00:13:22,931 --> 00:13:25,101
<i>Once again,
I fake-cried and kind of</i>

333
00:13:25,206 --> 00:13:26,926
<i>played like
I don't know what to do,</i>

334
00:13:27,034 --> 00:13:30,214
I need a lifeline,
um, which is partly true.

335
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,140
<i>I'm trying
to see what can stick.</i>

336
00:13:32,241 --> 00:13:34,381
<i>If I can at least make it
through one more vote,</i>

337
00:13:34,482 --> 00:13:35,722
<i>I think I'm set.</i>

338
00:13:35,827 --> 00:13:37,167
I can use my idol at the five.

339
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,205
Phew. I don't think
she has the idol.

340
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,760
- You don't think so?
- No.

341
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,302
I feel like she would have
played it by now if she did.

342
00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:43,544
- I do, too.
- She was in some pretty,

343
00:13:43,586 --> 00:13:45,136
like, bleak-looking spots.

344
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,931
Brah, if she didn't,
she is a way better...

345
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:49,889
- Nerves of steel.
- She's an even better player
than I thought. Yeah.

346
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:52,521
- She's very dangerous, and...
- Yeah, 100%.

347
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,889
We've been wanting
to get the girls broken up

348
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:55,451
- for a long time.
- Yeah.

349
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:58,031
And, like, to take this easy
shot, now's the time to do it.

350
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,751
And if Karla wins, then we've
got Cassidy we can get rid of.

351
00:13:59,793 --> 00:14:01,763
- You know, I think we'll be...
- Yeah.

352
00:14:01,862 --> 00:14:03,502
- I think we'll be all right.
- I do, too.

353
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,761
<i>Cody wants the boys
to take out Karla or Cassidy,</i>

354
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:10,412
<i>which works great for me
because my goal is to get out</i>

355
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,167
Karla at this next vote.

356
00:14:12,275 --> 00:14:13,889
- I feel good.
We got a... we got a good plan.
- I do, too.

357
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:15,551
Keep the boys safe.

358
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:18,655
<i>Karla is very dangerous
because she has</i>

359
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:21,588
<i>the potential to win this game,
and for either of us</i>

360
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:24,309
to stand a chance,
Karla has to go.

361
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:26,553
This is so nice.

362
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,550
So I'm just so over losing.

363
00:14:32,655 --> 00:14:34,275
I know. It sucks.

364
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:35,958
- Now we can do...
- One good thing is that we get

365
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,520
to eat the rest of the rice,
I guess.

366
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,970
You know, I found in <i>Survivor,</i>

367
00:14:39,068 --> 00:14:40,928
every time
you get kicked in the gut,

368
00:14:41,034 --> 00:14:42,544
there's some victory
that comes out of this thing.

369
00:14:42,586 --> 00:14:45,616
<i>The reward challenge today
was bittersweet.</i>

370
00:14:45,724 --> 00:14:47,974
Actually, it was bitter,
'cause we didn't get any sweet.

371
00:14:48,068 --> 00:14:49,618
<i>But this close
to the end, though,</i>

372
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:51,244
<i>there's very strong players
that need</i>

373
00:14:51,344 --> 00:14:53,764
<i>to get out of the way in order
for me to win this game.</i>

374
00:14:53,862 --> 00:14:56,242
We could talk maybe about
getting to the final three,

375
00:14:56,344 --> 00:14:57,764
and, you know, I'd like...

376
00:14:57,862 --> 00:14:59,509
It'd be great if the three
of us could be down there.

377
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:01,591
- We all have
three very different stories.
- Right.

378
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:03,647
'Cause, you know, Cody may claim
that his story is your story.

379
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:05,209
You know what I mean?

380
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,720
- Yeah.
-"Like, I did that.
Well, no, I did that."

381
00:15:07,827 --> 00:15:11,167
- And Karla will claim
that your story is her story.
- Yup.

382
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:14,545
<i>I planted the seed of
get rid of Cody and Karla.</i>

383
00:15:14,655 --> 00:15:16,275
<i>And you know what's awesome?</i>

384
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:18,719
<i>I don't think people
see the game I'm playing.</i>

385
00:15:18,827 --> 00:15:20,277
<i>The best assassin doesn't</i>

386
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,029
show up at the castle
with an ax saying,

387
00:15:22,137 --> 00:15:24,277
"I'm here to kill the king."

388
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:25,969
He or she slips
into the kitchen,

389
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:28,688
puts a vial of poison
in the king's bowl and leaves.

390
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:31,483
We need to get him or Karla
on this next vote.

391
00:15:31,586 --> 00:15:32,826
I think that's a great idea.

392
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:34,241
<i>I'm hiding in plain sight.</i>

393
00:15:34,344 --> 00:15:35,944
<i>I am wearing some
pretty impressive camo.</i>

394
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,340
<i>Maybe that's it.</i>

395
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:39,278
Look at me now.

396
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:41,019
Right? I'm just, like,
frozen in the tree.

397
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:43,448
<i>They just don't seem
to see me, which is fine.</i>

398
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:45,411
I mean,
it's no doubt Cody or Karla.

399
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:48,407
- I sort of worry,
like, he has an idol.
- Got you.

400
00:15:48,517 --> 00:15:49,889
Everyone's scared
he's gonna play the idol,

401
00:15:49,931 --> 00:15:51,544
so I don't want to waste time
voting for him.

402
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:53,996
Well, I mean, nobody wants
to be next to Karla,

403
00:15:54,103 --> 00:15:55,553
so Karla will be a safe bet.

404
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:57,275
But she also an idol, so...

405
00:15:57,379 --> 00:15:59,479
- Probably or...
- She definitely does.

406
00:15:59,586 --> 00:16:01,966
Okay. So she definitely does.

407
00:16:02,068 --> 00:16:03,618
- Aha.
- Yeah.

408
00:16:03,724 --> 00:16:05,104
So Karla may play hers tomorrow.

409
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:06,476
Cody can play his...

410
00:16:06,586 --> 00:16:08,236
I mean, ideally,
we could flush an idol

411
00:16:08,344 --> 00:16:10,074
and eliminate
one of those two big threats.

412
00:16:10,172 --> 00:16:12,212
<i>Cass saying
that Karla has an idol</i>

413
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,900
<i>just sort of reaffirms that,
like, Gabler is right.</i>

414
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,268
Cody and Karla are
sort of threats

415
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,550
because they have these idols.

416
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:18,923
They have these guaranteed paths

417
00:16:18,965 --> 00:16:19,965
<i>into the final five.</i>

418
00:16:20,068 --> 00:16:22,448
You guys all sugar cracked out?

419
00:16:22,551 --> 00:16:24,031
<i>But I do trust Cody.</i>

420
00:16:24,137 --> 00:16:25,475
<i>You know,
he's been keeping his idol</i>

421
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,657
<i>in my bag because he trusts me.</i>

422
00:16:27,758 --> 00:16:29,858
And I have Jeanine's old idol
which everybody thinks

423
00:16:29,965 --> 00:16:31,445
walked out the door with Dwight.

424
00:16:31,551 --> 00:16:33,406
<i>So me and Cody are
in a good spot, whereas, like,</i>

425
00:16:33,448 --> 00:16:35,658
<i>Karla is a huge threat,
which is awesome for me,</i>

426
00:16:35,758 --> 00:16:37,618
and not that great for her.

427
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:40,829
For sure.

428
00:16:40,931 --> 00:16:42,647
So, who told you?
Cass told you she has one?

429
00:16:42,689 --> 00:16:44,999
Interesting. 'Cause she was
like, "I don't have it."

430
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:47,663
- If she plays her idol tomorrow?
- Well, I think

431
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:49,658
I'd play mine if she plays hers.

432
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,758
Yeah.

433
00:16:53,655 --> 00:16:54,825
<i>Karla has an immunity idol.</i>

434
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,591
<i>It's absolutely preposterous.</i>

435
00:16:56,689 --> 00:16:58,682
<i>She's lied to me this whole
game. She's been full of B.S.</i>

436
00:16:58,724 --> 00:17:00,664
<i>And now I can smell it.</i>

437
00:17:00,758 --> 00:17:02,898
<i>We cannot let her win.</i>

438
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,660
- Anybody but Karla.
- Or I mean, Cass,
for that matter.

439
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,308
<i>But one of us four guys need
to win the challenge. I just had</i>

440
00:17:08,413 --> 00:17:11,663
3,000 calories of Danish here.
So, that's gonna be huge

441
00:17:11,758 --> 00:17:13,408
for tomorrow
on a huge challenge.

442
00:17:13,517 --> 00:17:16,757
I'm like... Bzz!
Good, like, sharp right now.

443
00:17:16,862 --> 00:17:18,172
- Good.
- Like, watch out.

444
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:20,925
Good. That's good.

445
00:17:21,034 --> 00:17:22,414
I'm not feeling that.

446
00:17:22,517 --> 00:17:24,137
That's right, buddy.

447
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:26,001
<i>I'm gonna be, frigging,
a Tasmanian devil</i>

448
00:17:26,103 --> 00:17:29,073
<i>as I always am in there, I'm
gonna be having a great time.</i>

449
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,170
I hope so.

450
00:17:33,275 --> 00:17:34,992
And I'm gonna give you guys
all a kiss right on the cheek.

451
00:17:35,034 --> 00:17:36,694
That's right.

452
00:17:36,793 --> 00:17:38,833
<i>With six people left,
if I win tomorrow,</i>

453
00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:40,651
I'm in the final five
with an immunity idol.

454
00:18:02,241 --> 00:18:04,521
Come on in.

455
00:18:18,586 --> 00:18:19,856
Good morning.

456
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,715
- Good morning.
- Hi, Jeff.

457
00:18:21,827 --> 00:18:24,857
- Ooh.
- Day 23 <i>Survivor 43.</i>

458
00:18:24,965 --> 00:18:28,615
All right, let's get
to today's immunity challenge.

459
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:31,414
First things first, Karla
and Owen, got to take it back.

460
00:18:31,517 --> 00:18:33,377
Of course, of course.

461
00:18:33,482 --> 00:18:36,792
- But you can win it back again.
- Yes. Thank you.

462
00:18:36,896 --> 00:18:38,306
Thank you.

463
00:18:38,413 --> 00:18:40,553
Thank you, Owen.

464
00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:45,929
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

465
00:18:46,034 --> 00:18:47,864
For today's challenge,

466
00:18:47,965 --> 00:18:49,509
<i>you're gonna race through
a series of obstacles,</i>

467
00:18:49,551 --> 00:18:51,761
<i>collecting a bag
of number tiles.</i>

468
00:18:51,862 --> 00:18:56,862
<i>You'll use those numbers to open
a combination, releasing a key.</i>

469
00:18:56,965 --> 00:18:58,335
<i>You'll then race up a cargo net</i>

470
00:18:58,448 --> 00:19:00,588
<i>and use that key
to unlock your puzzle pieces.</i>

471
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:04,689
<i>It is then a race
to assemble a bat puzzle.</i>

472
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:09,003
First person
to finish wins immunity,

473
00:19:09,103 --> 00:19:11,213
guaranteed a spot
in the final five.

474
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,170
Biggest stakes of the season.

475
00:19:14,275 --> 00:19:16,335
We'll draw for spots.
Here we go.

476
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:18,208
- Let's do it.
- Let's go.

477
00:19:25,586 --> 00:19:28,136
All right, here we go,
for immunity

478
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:31,971
and a guaranteed spot in the
final five, Survivors ready?

479
00:19:33,586 --> 00:19:37,996
Go! First, you're up and over
a cargo net.

480
00:19:38,103 --> 00:19:41,103
On day 23,
everybody is flying down this.

481
00:19:41,206 --> 00:19:44,716
Karla takes a big hit.

482
00:19:44,827 --> 00:19:46,447
But she's still in it.
Not the first time

483
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:49,071
Karla has suffered an injury
on a challenge.

484
00:19:49,172 --> 00:19:51,482
You got
to attack this challenge.

485
00:19:51,586 --> 00:19:53,406
You want to get to five.

486
00:19:53,517 --> 00:19:56,377
Do not let somebody
take you out at six.

487
00:19:57,862 --> 00:19:59,832
Cody's gonna get through first.

488
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:01,551
Owen right next to him.

489
00:20:01,655 --> 00:20:05,095
There's Cassidy and Karla.
Gabler has his.

490
00:20:05,206 --> 00:20:06,856
It's Jesse, the only person yet

491
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:10,165
to win an immunity challenge,
in dead last.

492
00:20:11,655 --> 00:20:15,025
Cody gonna get
to his combination first.

493
00:20:15,137 --> 00:20:17,997
Cassidy's out second.
There's Owen.

494
00:20:18,103 --> 00:20:20,143
There's Karla.
Here comes Gabler.

495
00:20:20,241 --> 00:20:22,411
Everybody gonna be in on it.

496
00:20:22,517 --> 00:20:24,587
Now you have three number tiles.

497
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:26,169
They are pairs of numbers.

498
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:28,825
Each pair represents one number.

499
00:20:28,931 --> 00:20:30,791
You're trying
to figure out the order.

500
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,306
Once you think
you have it, try it.

501
00:20:33,413 --> 00:20:35,103
If it doesn't work, try again.

502
00:20:37,482 --> 00:20:42,172
Jesse goes from dead last
to first. Jesse solves his.

503
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,065
He's through.

504
00:20:45,275 --> 00:20:48,095
There's Owen. He solves his.
Gabler has his.

505
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:50,406
Jesse up the cargo net.

506
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:53,137
Use that key to unlock
your puzzle pieces, Jesse.

507
00:20:53,241 --> 00:20:55,691
- Oh!
- Owen has lost his key.

508
00:20:55,793 --> 00:20:58,173
He's got to go back.

509
00:20:58,275 --> 00:21:01,335
He forgot it. Cody has his.

510
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:05,586
Cassidy has hers.
Cassidy's through.

511
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,450
Here comes Cody.

512
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:10,791
Now, it's everybody but Karla.

513
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:13,756
Karla's still working
on her combination.

514
00:21:13,862 --> 00:21:15,662
Cassidy is up.

515
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:19,548
Cody's up.
Owen is up.

516
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:21,475
Jesse gonna start working
on the puzzle.

517
00:21:21,586 --> 00:21:24,336
Cassidy right behind.

518
00:21:24,448 --> 00:21:27,098
Gabler's got his first two,
both in the paint.

519
00:21:27,206 --> 00:21:29,786
Owen, there you go. You're good.
Cody getting in on it.

520
00:21:29,896 --> 00:21:32,656
Everybody starts solving. Karla
has her combination solved.

521
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,278
Here she comes.

522
00:21:37,482 --> 00:21:39,522
Five of the six players
on the puzzle right now.

523
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,030
That's what you want on day 23.

524
00:21:42,137 --> 00:21:43,717
Karla working her way up
the cargo net,

525
00:21:43,827 --> 00:21:46,237
and she is still smiling.

526
00:21:46,344 --> 00:21:49,624
That is what you want
from a <i>Survivor</i> player.

527
00:21:50,655 --> 00:21:52,855
You're making a bat puzzle.

528
00:21:52,965 --> 00:21:56,205
Just think about your puzzle
and how you're building it.

529
00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:00,690
<i>Survivor</i> puzzles always look
so simple when they're finished,

530
00:22:00,793 --> 00:22:02,623
but assembling them
is another thing entirely.

531
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,240
Our puzzle designers
know what they're doing.

532
00:22:06,344 --> 00:22:08,414
They know how
to make puzzles complicated

533
00:22:08,517 --> 00:22:11,137
even though they look simple.

534
00:22:11,241 --> 00:22:12,785
There are probably lots of ways
you can build this puzzle

535
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:14,657
that's not right.

536
00:22:14,758 --> 00:22:17,168
It is Cassidy in the lead
with Karla

537
00:22:17,275 --> 00:22:21,475
and Jesse right on her tail
on one side while Cody,

538
00:22:21,586 --> 00:22:23,856
Owen and Gabler trying
to catch up on the other.

539
00:22:23,965 --> 00:22:25,715
Damn.

540
00:22:25,827 --> 00:22:28,167
Cassidy with a bit
of a lead still,

541
00:22:28,275 --> 00:22:31,095
but Karla has caught up.
She was last

542
00:22:31,206 --> 00:22:34,276
to get to the puzzle,
but that's why we have puzzles.

543
00:22:34,379 --> 00:22:36,519
- You know what's wild, Jeff?
- What?

544
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,790
Is that, like, your hands get...
At least my hands,

545
00:22:38,896 --> 00:22:40,406
because of the nerves...

546
00:22:40,517 --> 00:22:42,027
They're all shot, you know?

547
00:22:42,137 --> 00:22:44,787
Like, it's just kind of,
like, they're so numb,

548
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:47,826
and it's, like,
kind of scary, so...

549
00:22:47,931 --> 00:22:49,971
Karla's had hand issues
this whole game.

550
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:52,208
For real.

551
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,380
Cody figured it out.
Cody's now in it.

552
00:22:54,482 --> 00:22:56,482
Cassidy down
to a few pieces left.

553
00:22:56,586 --> 00:22:58,786
Karla down to a few pieces left.

554
00:22:58,896 --> 00:23:00,509
They're side by side
fighting for immunity.

555
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:04,551
That is the race right now.
Cody's in it, as well.

556
00:23:04,655 --> 00:23:06,615
Wow. Look-look at them.
They're cramping.

557
00:23:06,724 --> 00:23:07,934
Hang in there, Karla.

558
00:23:08,034 --> 00:23:10,174
Dude!
Karla really struggling.

559
00:23:10,275 --> 00:23:12,335
Aah! I just twisted
my ankle so bad.

560
00:23:12,448 --> 00:23:14,378
Her entire body
is shutting down,

561
00:23:14,482 --> 00:23:16,312
and Cody is seizing
the opportunity.

562
00:23:16,413 --> 00:23:19,343
We got a challenge. Karla,
you're gonna have to dig.

563
00:23:19,448 --> 00:23:21,968
It is now Cassidy and Cody,

564
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:25,828
with Karla still in it
but faltering physically.

565
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:28,311
Hang in there, Karla.

566
00:23:28,413 --> 00:23:32,213
- Thank you. Aah!
- Cassidy down
to three pieces left.

567
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,000
Cody down to five pieces left.

568
00:23:36,379 --> 00:23:39,309
Cassidy down to two pieces.

569
00:23:39,413 --> 00:23:41,763
It is Cassidy and Cody.

570
00:23:41,862 --> 00:23:43,692
Karla is falling out.

571
00:23:43,793 --> 00:23:45,663
Cassidy with another piece.

572
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,208
Can Cody catch her on the end?

573
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,830
He's racing.

574
00:23:48,931 --> 00:23:50,311
Cassidy with her last piece.

575
00:23:50,413 --> 00:23:52,933
- Got it.
- Cassidy thinks she has it.

576
00:23:53,034 --> 00:23:54,214
Cassidy is wrong.

577
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,280
- Oh.
- This challenge is still on.

578
00:23:56,379 --> 00:23:59,619
Something is not right.
Cody's still digging.

579
00:23:59,724 --> 00:24:03,624
Karla now getting back in there.
Karla down to two pieces.

580
00:24:03,724 --> 00:24:06,594
Cassidy now trying
to fix her puzzle.

581
00:24:06,689 --> 00:24:08,999
Can Cody seize this opportunity?

582
00:24:09,103 --> 00:24:10,833
This is coming down
to the last two pieces.

583
00:24:10,931 --> 00:24:12,171
Cody down to a few pieces.

584
00:24:12,275 --> 00:24:13,785
I'm done! I'm done! Jeff! Jeff!

585
00:24:13,896 --> 00:24:15,756
Cassidy thinks she has it.

586
00:24:15,862 --> 00:24:17,382
And this time Cassidy is right.

587
00:24:17,482 --> 00:24:19,972
Individual immunity for Cassidy.

588
00:24:20,068 --> 00:24:24,518
Guaranteed a spot
in the final five.

589
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,030
Wow. What a challenge.

590
00:24:27,137 --> 00:24:29,237
Cody got his puzzle

591
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:32,484
just a couple
of seconds too late.

592
00:24:32,586 --> 00:24:36,586
That was a close finish.

593
00:24:36,689 --> 00:24:37,969
Huge effort by everybody.

594
00:24:38,068 --> 00:24:39,998
- Good job, Cass.
- Good job, Cass.

595
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:43,313
- Ugh!
- Cassidy, come over.

596
00:24:43,413 --> 00:24:45,693
Congratulations.

597
00:24:45,793 --> 00:24:48,103
- Good job, Cass.
- Biggest win of the season

598
00:24:48,206 --> 00:24:49,826
so far, day 23.

599
00:24:49,931 --> 00:24:51,854
- Thank you so much.
- You get to wear this again.

600
00:24:51,896 --> 00:24:53,656
Well earned.

601
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,278
- Thank you.
- You are safe.

602
00:24:55,379 --> 00:24:57,549
- You are guaranteed a spot
in the final five.
- Yeah.

603
00:24:57,655 --> 00:24:59,375
As for the rest of you,

604
00:24:59,482 --> 00:25:02,552
after 23 days,
one of you will be voted out.

605
00:25:02,655 --> 00:25:04,302
- That will not be you.
You are safe. Congrats.
- Thank you.

606
00:25:04,344 --> 00:25:05,716
- Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.
- Good job, Cass.

607
00:25:05,758 --> 00:25:06,923
- See you tonight at Tribal.
- Thank you so much.

608
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:08,165
Well done, Cassidy.

609
00:25:08,275 --> 00:25:09,615
- Thank you.
- You need help?

610
00:25:09,724 --> 00:25:11,130
<i>This immunity was
a tough one to lose</i>

611
00:25:11,172 --> 00:25:12,972
<i>because my body literally</i>

612
00:25:13,068 --> 00:25:15,658
gave up on me,
and I couldn't do anything.

613
00:25:15,758 --> 00:25:17,548
<i>Now Cassidy's safe.</i>

614
00:25:17,655 --> 00:25:20,545
<i>I know people are gunning
for me, but I have an idol,</i>

615
00:25:20,655 --> 00:25:22,755
and it's showtime, baby.

616
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,830
<i>Ay, caramba.</i>

617
00:25:40,758 --> 00:25:42,233
- But I mean, it is...
- Two idols at play.

618
00:25:42,275 --> 00:25:44,165
- Two idols.
- And then
we didn't get immunity.

619
00:25:44,275 --> 00:25:46,199
There's six people, so there's
three people that we might

620
00:25:46,241 --> 00:25:49,211
- Yeah.
- be able to shoot at.
If Cody and Karla were open,

621
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,923
- No, absolutely.
- That's a different story.

622
00:25:50,965 --> 00:25:52,275
If they both play idols,

623
00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:54,409
it could be me or you
or Jesse that goes.

624
00:25:54,517 --> 00:25:56,447
<i>It's pretty complicated
right now because</i>

625
00:25:56,551 --> 00:25:58,031
<i>Cassie's got immunity,</i>

626
00:25:58,137 --> 00:25:59,475
<i>Karla has an idol
and Cody has an idol.</i>

627
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:00,785
<i>Probably, they're gonna
play 'em tonight.</i>

628
00:26:00,827 --> 00:26:02,027
<i>And at this point in the game,</i>

629
00:26:02,137 --> 00:26:04,377
<i>there's no more
Shot in the Dark.</i>

630
00:26:04,482 --> 00:26:08,482
So, me, Owen or Jesse will...
will tap out.

631
00:26:08,586 --> 00:26:10,616
<i>Tonight is my biggest hurdle.</i>

632
00:26:10,724 --> 00:26:11,958
So you're saying
there's a chance?

633
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,450
So you're saying there's
a chance.

634
00:26:13,551 --> 00:26:15,241
I have an idol.

635
00:26:15,344 --> 00:26:17,244
- I have an idol.
- Okay.

636
00:26:17,344 --> 00:26:19,406
- Do you want to go
to the final four with me?
- I do.

637
00:26:19,448 --> 00:26:20,788
Here's how.

638
00:26:21,793 --> 00:26:23,413
- Okay?
- Yes.

639
00:26:24,758 --> 00:26:26,318
I'm gonna tell Cass
I'm playing my idol.

640
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:28,716
And then you, like,
just tell them,

641
00:26:28,758 --> 00:26:30,318
"Like, hey,
I'm playing my idol." But...

642
00:26:36,275 --> 00:26:38,275
Okay.

643
00:26:38,379 --> 00:26:39,619
I love a threat.

644
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:41,144
If you don't vote our way, bro,

645
00:26:41,241 --> 00:26:42,475
we could easily
just vote you out.

646
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,857
Exactly.

647
00:26:43,965 --> 00:26:46,275
You are such
a brilliant man, Cody.

648
00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:47,999
<i>Wow. Like, this could work.</i>

649
00:26:48,103 --> 00:26:50,383
<i>Let's not go after each other.
It's, let's work together</i>

650
00:26:50,482 --> 00:26:52,522
and threaten people that
we're gonna use our idols,

651
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,380
and, uh, then we keep our idols

652
00:26:55,482 --> 00:26:57,662
and go to the five
with our idols

653
00:26:57,758 --> 00:26:58,992
<i>and guarantee our spots
in the four.</i>

654
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,384
<i>And so now Cody, Jesse, and I</i>

655
00:27:01,482 --> 00:27:03,102
ultimately can decide
who goes home...

656
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:04,476
<i>Gabler or Owen.</i>

657
00:27:04,586 --> 00:27:06,516
So I have an idol, um, and, uh,

658
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,340
- Cody's playing his
and I'm playing mine.
- Okay.

659
00:27:09,448 --> 00:27:11,828
You know, if you want to stay,
like, would you vote Owen?

660
00:27:11,931 --> 00:27:14,931
- I would.
- 100%. To stay in the game?

661
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:21,554
<i>When you put people at risk,
it's fascinating to see</i>

662
00:27:21,655 --> 00:27:24,205
how quickly people will turn
on their own alliance.

663
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,350
- If push comes to shove...
- You'd be willing to...

664
00:27:26,448 --> 00:27:28,618
I'm willing
to write Gabler's name down.

665
00:27:28,724 --> 00:27:31,284
Homeboy's gonna play it,
I'm gonna play it.

666
00:27:35,137 --> 00:27:36,617
<i>It's a scare tactic, and it's...</i>

667
00:27:36,724 --> 00:27:39,104
it's foolproof, too,
though, right? Like, if

668
00:27:39,206 --> 00:27:41,446
<i>we get a bad vibe,
we could still use our idols.</i>

669
00:27:41,551 --> 00:27:43,451
<i>I'll use my idol,
Cody would use his idol.</i>

670
00:27:43,551 --> 00:27:44,854
<i>You know,
and we'll just duke it out</i>

671
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:46,276
<i>at the five
without idols, right?</i>

672
00:27:46,379 --> 00:27:47,689
<i>But as long</i>

673
00:27:47,793 --> 00:27:49,793
as this works out,
you'll see me at the final four.

674
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,336
Okay. Okay.

675
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:58,761
We're playing 'em.

676
00:28:03,068 --> 00:28:04,647
She's gonna buy it.
And wham, we knock her

677
00:28:04,689 --> 00:28:07,619
right out of this game.
Won't see it coming.

678
00:28:07,724 --> 00:28:09,384
- Is-is...
- Love that, bro. Okay.

679
00:28:09,482 --> 00:28:11,544
So we just... Uh, yeah, we just
can't let her get the drift

680
00:28:11,586 --> 00:28:13,026
that us four guys are together.

681
00:28:13,137 --> 00:28:14,517
I'm stretching the truth
to Kar...

682
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,860
You know what?
The hell with it.

683
00:28:15,965 --> 00:28:17,785
I'm lying to Karla.
I am lying to her

684
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,756
<i>so she doesn't
play her idol tonight</i>

685
00:28:19,862 --> 00:28:22,172
<i>so that way I can blindside
the hell out of her.</i>

686
00:28:22,275 --> 00:28:23,855
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

687
00:28:23,965 --> 00:28:25,233
<i>"Genius" is the word
for this plan.</i>

688
00:28:25,275 --> 00:28:27,025
<i>I've been out here for 23 days.</i>

689
00:28:27,137 --> 00:28:29,787
I'm a quick learner, and I've
learned very fast like a sponge.

690
00:28:29,896 --> 00:28:31,616
And I'm out here as, you know,

691
00:28:31,724 --> 00:28:33,594
Wild Thing, Killer Cody,
Cowboy Cody.

692
00:28:33,689 --> 00:28:35,029
Call me whatever you want,

693
00:28:35,137 --> 00:28:36,577
but the switch
has definitely turned.

694
00:28:36,655 --> 00:28:38,685
And, um...

695
00:28:38,793 --> 00:28:41,073
yeah, sometimes
I surprise even myself.

696
00:28:44,965 --> 00:28:45,865
Karla.

697
00:28:45,965 --> 00:28:47,445
The four amigos of Owen,

698
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:49,901
<i>Gabler, Cody and Jesse
are all gonna vote Karla.</i>

699
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,920
<i>And she's gonna leave Tribal
with a walking stick</i>

700
00:28:51,965 --> 00:28:54,715
<i>that I made her and an idol.</i>

701
00:28:58,758 --> 00:29:00,308
<i>Jesse is on board.</i>

702
00:29:00,413 --> 00:29:01,682
<i>I love that guy.
He's my roll dog.</i>

703
00:29:01,724 --> 00:29:03,104
<i>Our trust</i>

704
00:29:03,206 --> 00:29:06,136
in our relationship
has gotten so, like, forged,

705
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:07,621
it's unbelievable.

706
00:29:10,689 --> 00:29:12,379
Yeah.

707
00:29:12,482 --> 00:29:14,172
<i>You know, Cody's plan
is great for him,</i>

708
00:29:14,275 --> 00:29:16,785
<i>but taking out Karla,
the biggest threat in the game,</i>

709
00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:19,066
<i>would absolutely
boost his résumé.</i>

710
00:29:23,068 --> 00:29:24,308
<i>We're at six now, and, like,</i>

711
00:29:24,413 --> 00:29:26,413
<i>I can't be seen
as Cody's number two.</i>

712
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:27,820
And they just see
that I've sort of,

713
00:29:27,862 --> 00:29:29,130
like, made the same moves
as Cody,

714
00:29:29,172 --> 00:29:31,102
<i>who's a little bit louder.</i>

715
00:29:31,206 --> 00:29:33,476
<i>It might be time
to just be openly cutthroat,</i>

716
00:29:33,586 --> 00:29:35,616
<i>but then, at the same time,
I don't know.</i>

717
00:29:35,724 --> 00:29:37,864
<i>There's a lot to think about.
Like, I-I love Cody,</i>

718
00:29:37,965 --> 00:29:40,065
<i>and I think he would
take me to the end, but, like,</i>

719
00:29:40,172 --> 00:29:42,242
<i>I have to wonder
if I can beat him.</i>

720
00:29:42,344 --> 00:29:44,454
<i>I got two kids at home,
I got a wife.</i>

721
00:29:44,551 --> 00:29:46,001
<i>And, like,</i>

722
00:29:46,103 --> 00:29:47,509
people are out here
and they're saying, like,

723
00:29:47,551 --> 00:29:49,721
"This is, like, so much fun,
right? Like, this..."

724
00:29:50,896 --> 00:29:53,376
"No matter what, like,
oh, we've already won."

725
00:29:53,482 --> 00:29:55,802
<i>You know, they want the million,
but, like, they seem like,</i>

726
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:58,002
<i>"Oh, this is all
about the experience."</i>

727
00:29:58,103 --> 00:30:01,073
<i>For me, like, no, the experience
is great, but, like,</i>

728
00:30:01,172 --> 00:30:04,722
for me, like, I need to secure
my family's future and, like...

729
00:30:07,827 --> 00:30:10,277
And I'll do anything to do that.
You know, I'll do anything.

730
00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:12,969
So...

731
00:30:13,068 --> 00:30:16,968
If I got to switch it up
and be more brutal, I will.

732
00:30:20,482 --> 00:30:22,412
Yeah, it is.

733
00:30:25,586 --> 00:30:28,656
Oh. Oh.

734
00:30:28,758 --> 00:30:32,828
Yeah.

735
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:35,141
She's gonna play hers.

736
00:30:35,241 --> 00:30:37,171
And we'll flush...

737
00:30:39,586 --> 00:30:41,996
- So...
- That's... completely great.

738
00:30:42,103 --> 00:30:44,723
<i>Right now, I'm sort of in
the driver's seat of the idol.</i>

739
00:30:44,827 --> 00:30:46,347
Cody thinks
he has it, like, locked in.

740
00:30:46,448 --> 00:30:48,208
Like, he doesn't
have it locked in.

741
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,970
Got him right
where we want 'em, Jesse.

742
00:30:53,931 --> 00:30:55,861
- I can't believe that.
- I... I know.

743
00:30:55,965 --> 00:30:57,375
I know.
Don't know how it went...

744
00:30:58,379 --> 00:30:59,619
I know.

745
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,244
<i>For Cody to be without an idol,</i>

746
00:31:01,344 --> 00:31:02,764
<i>that is so beautiful, because</i>

747
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:04,422
he's unprotected.
We don't know for sure

748
00:31:04,482 --> 00:31:06,142
if Karla's gonna play her idol
or not yet.

749
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:08,281
<i>So we're throwing
all our votes on Cody.</i>

750
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,820
Actually, I do. I want
to see what yours looks like.

751
00:31:11,862 --> 00:31:13,164
- Yeah, for sure. I'll get it.
- Okay.

752
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:14,476
<i>I want to just lock it down</i>

753
00:31:14,586 --> 00:31:16,026
<i>- so nothing gets screwed up.</i>
- Cody.

754
00:31:16,103 --> 00:31:17,973
Okay. Phew.

755
00:31:18,965 --> 00:31:20,305
Okay.

756
00:31:25,931 --> 00:31:28,171
Oh!

757
00:31:28,275 --> 00:31:30,405
Yup.

758
00:31:30,517 --> 00:31:31,617
There we are.

759
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:33,694
<i>I didn't want to push back</i>

760
00:31:33,793 --> 00:31:35,483
<i>because then
that will make him nervous.</i>

761
00:31:35,586 --> 00:31:37,786
<i>So I had to hand off the idol.</i>

762
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:41,586
And I almost made it. I was,
like, trying to... Aah!

763
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,310
Mm-hmm.

764
00:31:49,862 --> 00:31:51,862
<i>If I can't get the idol back,
the plan will change</i>

765
00:31:51,965 --> 00:31:53,855
just because
it's out of my control.

766
00:31:54,862 --> 00:31:56,692
No.

767
00:31:56,793 --> 00:31:58,523
<i>And then Karla
has an idol, and...</i>

768
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,720
Aah! It's just a mess.

769
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:04,896
<i>This is worst-case scenario.</i>

770
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,760
It's so unbelievable
that I can almost believe it.

771
00:32:08,862 --> 00:32:11,482
- A lot scarier.
- Yeah, it is.

772
00:32:11,586 --> 00:32:13,896
<i>For some reason,
Jesse gave it back to Cody.</i>

773
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Oh, these are very different, actually.

774
00:32:17,655 --> 00:32:20,615
<i>My plan with Karla is
foolproof, 100% foolproof.</i>

775
00:32:20,724 --> 00:32:22,794
If Karla gets spooked
and plays her idol,

776
00:32:22,896 --> 00:32:25,546
<i>completely fine.
I'm still safe with my idol.</i>

777
00:32:25,655 --> 00:32:29,065
<i>If both Cody and Karla
play their idols, myself,</i>

778
00:32:29,172 --> 00:32:32,342
<i>Jesse or Gabler could go home
with just one vote.</i>

779
00:32:32,448 --> 00:32:34,898
<i>The gloves are off now.
There's no more niceties.</i>

780
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,210
<i>It's a death match
to get to the end.</i>

781
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,000
<i>To know I'm gonna this crazy
Tribal tonight</i>

782
00:32:39,103 --> 00:32:41,663
<i>with this protection on
is absolutely vital.</i>

783
00:32:41,758 --> 00:32:43,130
Tonight's blindside
will be the biggest

784
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:44,932
of the season for sure.
No doubt about it.

785
00:32:45,034 --> 00:32:48,034
<i>What could go wrong inSurvivor
at the final six?</i>

786
00:32:48,137 --> 00:32:50,337
I don't know. You know,
just a million different things.

787
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,620
So let's start with today.

788
00:33:20,724 --> 00:33:22,104
We obviously know how it ended.

789
00:33:22,206 --> 00:33:23,446
Cassidy has a necklace,

790
00:33:23,551 --> 00:33:25,141
another individual immunity win.

791
00:33:25,241 --> 00:33:26,831
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

792
00:33:26,931 --> 00:33:28,831
But it was not easy. Karla,

793
00:33:28,931 --> 00:33:31,691
you were close to having
a real shot at winning,

794
00:33:31,793 --> 00:33:33,663
and your entire body
just seized up.

795
00:33:33,758 --> 00:33:34,928
How are you right now?

796
00:33:35,034 --> 00:33:37,934
Um, I'm physically exhausted.

797
00:33:38,034 --> 00:33:41,594
Um, I still feel tingly
all over my hands.

798
00:33:41,689 --> 00:33:43,589
Um, tired.

799
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,519
Uh, my ankle hurts.

800
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,790
It's swollen.
We're out of rice.

801
00:33:47,896 --> 00:33:49,966
We have a few coconuts.
And the heat.

802
00:33:50,068 --> 00:33:52,408
So, it's been a long,
uh, afternoon.

803
00:33:52,517 --> 00:33:55,547
The other big story
of that challenge was, Cody,

804
00:33:55,655 --> 00:33:57,205
you lost by seconds.

805
00:33:59,482 --> 00:34:00,932
Yeah, it's a real bummer.

806
00:34:01,034 --> 00:34:02,682
Uh, you know, I don't know
another way to summarize it

807
00:34:02,724 --> 00:34:05,344
for you, Jeff.
To be seconds away

808
00:34:05,448 --> 00:34:07,440
from wearing that necklace
is a couple of seconds away

809
00:34:07,482 --> 00:34:09,172
from coming here,

810
00:34:09,275 --> 00:34:11,337
in just completely different
emotional state of mind.

811
00:34:11,379 --> 00:34:14,209
Jesse, the other side
of this is that

812
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:17,520
now you have to go back to camp
and try to strategize

813
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,380
when there are only
five choices.

814
00:34:19,482 --> 00:34:21,662
Yeah. I mean,
Cassidy's safe, and then,

815
00:34:21,758 --> 00:34:24,378
two of them are also safe...
Uh, Karla and Cody... so...

816
00:34:24,482 --> 00:34:25,692
Why are they also safe?

817
00:34:25,793 --> 00:34:27,523
Uh, they've sort of,

818
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,900
kind of made it known

819
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,475
that they're gonna be
playing their idols tonight.

820
00:34:30,517 --> 00:34:34,137
Karla, what was
the rationale to say, A,

821
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:37,411
"I have an idol," and B,
"I am playing it tonight"?

822
00:34:37,517 --> 00:34:41,617
Yeah. Um, I feel like rumors
of me having an idol...

823
00:34:41,724 --> 00:34:43,214
Well, clearly, they're true...

824
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,860
Have been making me a target,
and this is the only way

825
00:34:45,965 --> 00:34:47,615
I can guarantee
my safety tonight.

826
00:34:47,724 --> 00:34:49,624
Cody, what was
the rationale for you?

827
00:34:49,724 --> 00:34:51,164
Was it simply fear that
"I didn't win

828
00:34:51,206 --> 00:34:52,716
and I think I'm a target"?

829
00:34:52,827 --> 00:34:55,307
Yeah. I'm gonna give myself a
shot to live to see another day.

830
00:34:55,413 --> 00:34:58,663
Um, you know, it's either today
or tomorrow that I play it.

831
00:34:58,758 --> 00:35:02,238
So, it's a pretty easy decision
for me, and, uh, I...

832
00:35:02,344 --> 00:35:05,214
I don't see any reason
that I wouldn't go that route.

833
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:09,480
So, Owen, what do you
do when you take all this in

834
00:35:09,586 --> 00:35:13,616
at camp and you think it's
either you, Jesse or Gabler?

835
00:35:13,724 --> 00:35:15,764
You have to go
and make your pitch,

836
00:35:15,862 --> 00:35:17,832
and you just hope
something sticks.

837
00:35:17,931 --> 00:35:21,101
But it's really crappy knowing
that someone with a necklace,

838
00:35:21,206 --> 00:35:24,166
two people with idols, it could
just take one vote to send one

839
00:35:24,275 --> 00:35:25,795
of the three of us home,
and, you know,

840
00:35:25,896 --> 00:35:28,336
that's a different pill to
swallow than getting voted out,

841
00:35:28,448 --> 00:35:30,378
you know, seven to two
or something like that.

842
00:35:30,482 --> 00:35:31,832
Like, it's tough.

843
00:35:31,931 --> 00:35:33,831
Jesse, it's also
a bit of gambling.

844
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:37,071
If they have idols and
those idols are good until five,

845
00:35:37,172 --> 00:35:39,662
they could wait, so
this could be a bluff, as well.

846
00:35:39,758 --> 00:35:42,718
Yeah, I mean, it could be,
but I don't feel like

847
00:35:42,827 --> 00:35:45,447
I'm in a position to sort of
call their bluff at this point.

848
00:35:45,551 --> 00:35:47,971
Like, you know, we talk
about the social contract

849
00:35:48,068 --> 00:35:50,130
that's been in place, and, like,
you have to really be like,

850
00:35:50,172 --> 00:35:51,716
"All right, you know, like, tell
me which dance moves to make,

851
00:35:51,758 --> 00:35:54,548
and I'll make them and, like,
we'll just go along." So...

852
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:57,925
Cody, that's a big move
if that's what you are doing.

853
00:35:58,034 --> 00:35:59,834
Two people saying,
"We're the royalty,

854
00:35:59,931 --> 00:36:01,691
"and we're gonna tell you
what the rules are.

855
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:03,713
"We're not going home,
and it's one of you three,

856
00:36:03,793 --> 00:36:05,973
and we're gonna decide."
Is that how you looked at it?

857
00:36:06,068 --> 00:36:08,788
Absolutely. I mean,
I'd be lying if I said

858
00:36:08,896 --> 00:36:10,371
I didn't talk to Karla
about it. You know,

859
00:36:10,413 --> 00:36:12,283
"Hey, who are we looking at?"

860
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:14,689
And, um, it could just be one

861
00:36:14,793 --> 00:36:17,553
that decides the fate
of someone tonight. And, um...

862
00:36:17,655 --> 00:36:20,405
as tragic as it sounds,
it's not me.

863
00:36:20,517 --> 00:36:22,067
Karla, Cody was just

864
00:36:22,172 --> 00:36:23,452
- really honest.
- Mm-hmm.

865
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:25,621
He said it's tragic,
but it won't be for me.

866
00:36:25,724 --> 00:36:27,414
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you feel similar?

867
00:36:27,517 --> 00:36:28,967
Yeah. I mean,

868
00:36:29,068 --> 00:36:31,138
luckily I do have something
to protect me tonight.

869
00:36:31,241 --> 00:36:35,591
So it is unfortunate, but I feel
confident and I hope that

870
00:36:35,689 --> 00:36:37,829
folks that I spoke to today
feel confident.

871
00:36:37,931 --> 00:36:39,931
How about you, Gabler?
How confident are you

872
00:36:40,034 --> 00:36:42,284
that what you were told
is gonna happen tonight?

873
00:36:42,379 --> 00:36:44,829
I-I think I'm pretty confident.

874
00:36:44,931 --> 00:36:46,171
I think I'm gonna see tomorrow.

875
00:36:46,275 --> 00:36:48,025
You know, 12 hours difference

876
00:36:48,137 --> 00:36:49,475
in <i>Survivor</i> is a world
of difference.

877
00:36:49,517 --> 00:36:50,787
And, you know, this afternoon

878
00:36:50,896 --> 00:36:52,276
it was an apex predator buffet

879
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:54,659
and we were just kind of
serving up whatever they were

880
00:36:54,758 --> 00:36:57,658
needing just to see if
we could sail to tomorrow.

881
00:36:57,758 --> 00:36:59,238
Jesse, you were
nodding in agreement.

882
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:01,284
Yeah. You know, I'm not
trying to make too many

883
00:37:01,379 --> 00:37:03,371
big moves, right? Like, I'm
just like, "You fill me in,

884
00:37:03,413 --> 00:37:04,573
let me know what's going on."

885
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,000
And as vulnerable
as I felt today,

886
00:37:07,103 --> 00:37:09,103
I hope that I landed
on the right move.

887
00:37:09,206 --> 00:37:10,446
How about you, Owen?

888
00:37:10,551 --> 00:37:12,831
You know, I was peddling
the book of Sandra today.

889
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:14,381
You know, anybody but me.

890
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,142
You know, I've been
in tough spots before

891
00:37:16,241 --> 00:37:18,621
in this game and I'm not
gonna count myself out.

892
00:37:18,724 --> 00:37:22,284
But I'd be lying if I said
I felt super-duper confident

893
00:37:22,379 --> 00:37:24,169
in my chances, but

894
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,955
I'm not counting myself out
just quite yet.

895
00:37:26,034 --> 00:37:29,034
Cody, how confident are you
that the vote is gonna go

896
00:37:29,137 --> 00:37:30,095
the way you think it will?

897
00:37:30,137 --> 00:37:32,377
Uh, I'll give it a niner.

898
00:37:32,482 --> 00:37:34,552
I'm pretty confident.
I think, um,

899
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:37,015
you know, I'm the person that
people were wanting to talk to

900
00:37:37,068 --> 00:37:40,278
and, um, they were giving me
the best pitch and, um,

901
00:37:40,379 --> 00:37:44,339
uh, yeah, nine and a half,
actually, is where I'm at.

902
00:37:44,448 --> 00:37:46,408
- Pretty good.
- Yeah. Pretty good. Yeah.

903
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:49,447
I think that's where
I'm at on this. 95%.

904
00:37:52,344 --> 00:37:54,384
All right, it is time to vote.

905
00:37:54,482 --> 00:37:56,382
Cody, you're up.

906
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:34,901
If anybody has an advantage

907
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,360
or an idol
and you want to play it,

908
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:39,103
now would be the time to do so.

909
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:54,616
Give me a minute.

910
00:38:58,344 --> 00:39:02,344
I think a couple of us took
a look at the social contract.

911
00:39:04,482 --> 00:39:06,522
We decided
to call people's bluffs.

912
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,310
So I'm playing this for Owen.

913
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:09,793
- For Owen.
- Yep.

914
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,030
This is a hidden immunity idol.

915
00:39:18,137 --> 00:39:21,377
Any votes cast for Owen
will not count.

916
00:39:28,689 --> 00:39:31,239
- All right...
- I... will play mine.

917
00:39:37,517 --> 00:39:38,687
Gonna play this for myself.

918
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,833
Okay.

919
00:39:44,206 --> 00:39:46,276
This is also
a hidden immunity idol.

920
00:39:46,379 --> 00:39:49,309
Any votes cast for Karla
will not count.

921
00:39:53,034 --> 00:39:55,104
All right, I'll read the votes.

922
00:40:01,448 --> 00:40:03,478
First vote: Owen.

923
00:40:03,586 --> 00:40:05,166
Does not count.

924
00:40:09,275 --> 00:40:11,305
Karla.
Does not count.

925
00:40:17,655 --> 00:40:19,655
Cody.
One vote Cody.

926
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,379
Cody.
Two votes Cody.

927
00:40:27,275 --> 00:40:30,785
Thirteenth person
voted out of <i>Survivor</i> 43: Cody.

928
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:33,516
Three. That's enough.
Need to bring me your torch.

929
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:38,858
Whew. Wow.

930
00:41:00,379 --> 00:41:03,519
Good playing, y'all.

931
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,930
I'm sorry.

932
00:41:05,034 --> 00:41:07,384
Wow.

933
00:41:11,517 --> 00:41:13,897
Cody, the tribe has spoken.

934
00:41:16,896 --> 00:41:17,796
Time to go.

935
00:41:17,896 --> 00:41:21,236
<i>A hui hou</i> and aloha.

936
00:41:21,344 --> 00:41:23,314
- Aloha, bro.
- Holler, brother.

937
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,210
You have made it
to the final five,

938
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:33,100
but this game is far from over.

939
00:41:33,206 --> 00:41:35,786
Tonight you will be taken
to a new beach

940
00:41:35,896 --> 00:41:38,786
where you will start over.

941
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:39,826
Oh, my God.

942
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:41,721
This is the beginning

943
00:41:41,827 --> 00:41:44,167
of the final push
to get to the end.

944
00:41:44,275 --> 00:41:45,175
Oh, Jesse.

945
00:41:45,275 --> 00:41:46,715
Dig in and hang on.

946
00:41:46,827 --> 00:41:48,897
Grab your torches,
head back to your new camp.

947
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,660
Good night.

948
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,278
- Golly, Jeff.
- Thanks, Jeff.
