1
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:10,260
>> 39 SEASONS, AND THIS GAME IS
FULL OF TWISTS ANDTURNS.

2
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,138
>> THERE ARE ENDLESS THINGS YOU
HAVE TO ADAPT TO.

3
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:18,309
>> "SURVIVOR" IS WHERE IT'S AT
NOW, BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT TO GET

4
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:21,271
CRAZY.

5
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,273
>> THERE'S ALWAYS A TWIST.

6
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:28,278
WHAT THESE GUYS DON'T KNOW IS
THAT SANDRA AND I ARE ACTUALLY

7
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:31,281
OUT HERE TO SHOW THE NEW KIDS
HOW IT'S DONE.

8
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:36,286
"SURVIVOR" SCHOOL IS IN SESSION.

9
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:40,290
>> Jeff: BOSTON ROB AND
SANDRA, TWO OF "SURVIVOR'S" MOST

10
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:43,334
DOMINANT WINNERS, ARE BACK.

11
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:48,298
>> I'M THE ONLY PERSON THAT'S
EVER WON TWICE.

12
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,300
AND I SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE THE
SAY IT.

13
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:53,386
YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW THIS,
BUT I'M COMING BACK BECAUSE IT'S

14
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:59,142
ABOUT TIME THE QUEEN TEACHES
OTHERS SOME OF HER TRICKS.

15
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,645
>> Jeff: THEY'RE ALREADY
ESTABLISHING THEIR WORLD, BUT

16
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,647
THIS TIME THEY'RE NOT COMPETING.

17
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:09,986
THEY WON'T VOTE, AND THEY CANNOT
WIN THE $1 MILLION.

18
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:13,031
INSTEAD, THEY'LL SERVE AS
MENTORS TO A NEW GROUP OF

19
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,784
PLAYERS.

20
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:18,870
THEY'LL LIVE ON THE ISLAND OF
THE IDOLS.

21
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:24,125
IT'S A "SURVIVOR" BOOTCAMP RUN
BY TWO MASTERS OF THE GAME.

22
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:28,671
>> WE UNDERSTAND EVERY COMPONENT
OF THIS GAME.

23
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,216
>> Jeff: EVERY PLAYER WHO
VISITS WILL BE INSTRUCTED IN A

24
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,509
DIFFERENT FACET OF "SURVIVOR."

25
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:37,222
>> YOUR LESSON IS ABOUT THE ART
OF PERSUASION, CALCULATED RISK,

26
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,015
STAYING CALM UNDER PRESSURE.

27
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,059
>> YOU CAME TO WIN, RIGHT?

28
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:41,810
>> ALL RIGHT.

29
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,019
LET'S GET TO WORK.

30
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:45,230
>> Jeff: AND THEN BE GIVEN AN
OPPORTUNITY TO TEST WHAT THEY'VE

31
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:48,024
LEARNED FOR AN A CHANCE TO WIN
AN ADVANTAGE.

32
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:51,027
>> ARE YOU CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO
TAKE THE RISK?

33
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,738
>> WHAT IS YOUR GUT TELLING YOU?

34
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:59,160
>> THIS IS OPPORTUNITY.

35
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:03,915
>> Jeff: WHICH ONINGS -- ONES
WILL RISE TO THE MOMENT?

36
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,500
>> HERE'S THE IDOL.

37
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,378
IT'S GOOD FOR ONE OF YOUR NEXT
THREE TRIBAL COUNCILS.

38
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:13,341
>> Jeff: AND WHICH ONE WILL
FALL VICTIMS TO THE LESSONS

39
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,300
LEARNED.

40
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,886
>> YOU LOSE YOUR VOTE AT NEXT
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

41
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,389
YOU WILL NEVER MAKE THAT SAME
MISTAKE AGAIN.

42
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,225
>> Jeff: AND WHO WILL HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO OUTWIT,

43
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:27,230
OUTPLAY, AND OUTLAST ALL THE
REST TO CLAIM THE $1 MILLION

44
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:33,236
PRIZE?

45
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:44,372
39 DAYS, 20 PEOPLE, ONE
SURVIVOR!

46
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:47,750
>> WE'RE HEADING TOWARD THIS
BEAUTIFUL ISLAND IN FIJI.

47
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,127
I COULDN'T BE MORE EXCITED.

48
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,129
I MEAN, THERE ARE NO WORDS TO
DESCRIBE.

49
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,422
EXCITED IS LIKE AN
UNDERSTATEMENT.

50
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,925
I CAN FEEL ALL THESE MIXED
EMOTIONS READY TO JUST BURST

51
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,928
OUT, BUT I GOT TO KEEP THEM
DOWN, BECAUSE AS SOON AS I GET

52
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:08,646
OFF THE BOAT, I HAVE TO BE CALM,
COOL, COLLECTED KARISHMA.

53
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,276
>> FINALLY.

54
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,402
>> OH, MY.

55
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,528
>> I'M SO EXCITED TO SEE MY
TRIBE MATES, BUT THEN I WAS

56
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:21,659
LIKE, WHERE IS JEFF PROBST, WHAT
IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?

57
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,245
>> WOW.

58
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,790
>> ISLAND OF THE IDOLS.

59
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:32,295
>> I LOOKED AT OUR TRIBE FLAG
AND I SAW "SURVIVOR: ISLAND OF

60
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:32,754
THE IDOLS."

61
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:33,880
I WAS LIKE, OH,.

62
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:38,760
NO WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IDOLS
IN GENERAL, IT'S ALREADY

63
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,429
PARANOIA, BUT THAT'S WHAT OUR
SEASON THEME IS REVOLVING

64
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,138
AROUND?

65
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:42,764
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS.

66
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:48,436
MY MIND IS BLOWN RIGHT NOW.

67
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,812
>> CHECK IT OUT.

68
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,940
>> I THINK ON TOP OF THINGS.

69
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,171
>> I'M FROM INDIA.

70
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:19,467
>> I'M MOAN.

71
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,928
>> I PLAYED HOCKEY A LONG TIME
AGO.

72
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,180
I PLAYED WITH THE RANGERS AND
THE KINGS A LONG TIME AGO.

73
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:24,847
>> THAT'S AWESOME.

74
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,140
>> DO YOU PLAY SPORTS IN.

75
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,016
>> I PLAYED BASKETBALL.

76
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,558
>> IN COLLEGE, RIGHT?

77
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,478
I CAN TELL.

78
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,522
>> OH, MY GOD.

79
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,358
WE HAVE AN OLYMPIC SWIMMER?

80
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,486
>> I AM A THREE-TIME OLYMPIC
SWIMMER, AND I AM A COMPETITOR.

81
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:45,368
IT'S BASICALLY EMBEDDED WITHIN
MY D.N.A. BECAUSE I'VE BEEN A

82
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,869
COMPETITIVE SWIMMER MY WHOLE
LIFE.

83
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:47,912
>> DO YOU PLAY BASEBALL?

84
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,706
>> NEW YORK BUT I LOVE BASEBALL.

85
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,375
>> I STEPPED AWAY FROM THE SPORT
A YEAR AND A HALF AGO.

86
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,502
IT WAS A VERY HARD TRANSITION.

87
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,088
YOU'RE AT THE OLYMPICS AND
YOU'RE AT SUCH A HIGH NOTE.

88
00:04:57,171 --> 00:05:01,009
YOU WONDER, WLL I EVER GET
THERE AGAIN?

89
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:04,679
THIS GAME HAS HONESTLY MADE ME
AS EXCITED AS I WAS FOR THE

90
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,889
OLYMPICS.

91
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,434
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD FEEL
THAT AGAIN.

92
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:12,395
>> I PLAY VIOLIN AND PIANO.

93
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,604
>> I PLAY THE FLUTE.

94
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,399
>> NO WAY.

95
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,567
>> ARE WE THE SAME?

96
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,570
>> WE ARE HAVING A GOOD TIME,
WHICH IS SUPER COOL, BECAUSE I

97
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,572
LITERALLY NEEDED SOME HAPPINESS
IN MY LIFE.

98
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,867
I WENT INTO THE MILITARY AT 18.

99
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,577
I PLAYED BASKETBALL FOR THE AIR
FORCE TEAM.

100
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,580
AND ABOUT THREE YEARS NEW YORK I
DEVELOPED A BRAIN TUMOR.

101
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,540
AS IT GREW, IT GORS WORSE.

102
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,876
AND AT ONE POINT I COULDN'T
WALK.

103
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,419
I COULDN'T TALK.

104
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:36,711
I ALMOST DIED.

105
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,421
>> WOW.

106
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,922
>> OH, MY GOODNESS.

107
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,425
>> WOW.

108
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,594
WE TRIED SOME MEDICATION, AND I
WAS REALLY LUCKY, BECAUSE RIGHT

109
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,637
NOW THE TUMOR IS COMPLETELY
GONE.

110
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,431
SO IT'S LIKE NEW LIFE.

111
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,433
>> THIS IS OUR HOME.

112
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,101
>> THAT'S WHY I'M HERE NOW.

113
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,646
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING DECENT.

114
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,107
I WANT TO BE THE SOLE SURVIVOR.

115
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,109
I WANT TO BE THE S-O-U-L
SURVIVOR.

116
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:00,610
IT'S GO.

117
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:08,159
>> SOMETHING IS WEIRD.

118
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:08,618
NO SCRAMBLING.

119
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:09,786
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

120
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:13,164
>> THE THEME OF THE SEASON IS
"ISLAND OF THE IDOLS," WHICH

121
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:17,168
REALLY MAKES YOUR MIND GO WILD.

122
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,127
>> GOOD LUCK.

123
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,254
>> I HAVE NEVER TOUCHED A BUFF
BEFORE.

124
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,255
>> THIS IS UNREAL.

125
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,133
>> I'M THINKING, ARE THERE IDOLS
ON THIS ISLAND?

126
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,636
IS THERE ANOTHER ISLAND THAT HAS
TONS OF IDOLS?

127
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,638
SO IT'S SURPRISING.

128
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:29,055
IT'S SHOCKING.

129
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:33,476
AND IT'S COOL.

130
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,227
I'M LAUREN, EVERYBODY.

131
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,144
>> HI, LAUREN.

132
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,980

00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:46,948
>> OH, AWESOME.

138
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,117
>> I TEACH THE LITTLE GUYS.

139
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,996
>> EVERYONE ON OUR TRIBE SEEMS
SMART AND BRIGHT AND SOCIAL.

140
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,499
EVERYONE IS EXCITED TO BE HERE,
WHICH I THINK IS A POSITIVE

141
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,125
THING.

142
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,167
WE'RE GOING TO GET TO WORK.

143
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:02,130
>> DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY
PREFERENCES AS TO WHAT THEY

144
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,297
MIGHT WANT TO DO FIRST?

145
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:09,470
>> DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO BUILD
A SHELT CENTER -- SHELLER?

146
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,680
>> WHO HAS A CONSTRUCTION
BACKGROUND?

147
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:19,188
>> COMING INTO THE GAME, I AM
WORRIED ABOUT MY AGE BECAUSE OF

148
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,191
THE STIGMA OF THE OLDER PERSON,
ESPECIALLY THE OLDER WOMAN.

149
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,527
I HAVE STARTED FIRE WITH BAMBOO.

150
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,905
THERE IS NO BETTER WAY TO MAKE
AN IMPACT IN THIS GAME THAN TO

151
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,532
MAKE FIRE.

152
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:35,204
>> I THINK SUPER MOM CAN DO IT.

153
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:40,168
DON'T LET ME DOWN.

154
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,169
>> I AM A LIFEGUARD.

>> YOU GOT IT.

162
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,556
>> IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE IN
LIFE THAT IF YOU PROVE WHO YOU

163
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,394
ARE, PEOPLE DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR
GENDER, WHAT YOUR AGE IS.

164
00:07:58,477 --> 00:08:02,398
>> WE GOT SMOKE!

165
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:08,237
IF YOU PROVE WHO YOU ARE, THEN
YOU CAN BECOME PART OF THEM.

166

>> IT WAS REALLY COOL.

172
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,008
TO BREAK THE MOLD ON THE OLDER
WOMAN.

173
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:29,967
>> YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING.

174
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,763
>> I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT THOSE GUYS.

175
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,766
I SHOWED MY TRIBE THAT I HAD A
SPECIAL SET OF SKILLS, AND I

176
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:46,651
KNEW HOW TO USE THEM.

177
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,237
Captioning funded by CBS
and FORD.

178
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,322
We go further, so you can.

179
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,826
>> HE NEEDS ONE OF THOSE, WHAT'S
IT CALLED?

180
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,204
HE'S A BEAST ON THAT.

181
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,080
>> OH, YEAH.

182
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,790
>> WHY DON'T YOU CUT DOWN A
TREE.

183
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:07,797
>> I'M THE FIRST MONG PERSON TO
BE CAST ON "SURVIVOR."

184
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,341
WE CAME OVER AS REFUGEES AFTER
THE VIETNAM WAR.

185
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,592
I GREW UP LOW INCOME.

186
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,803
I WAS FIRST IN MY FAMILY TO GO
TO AN INSTITUTION LIKE STANFORD.

187
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,012
>> THAT'S PERFECT.

188
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:18,432
>> I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THAT TIME
OF PERSON THAT DOES THE WORK.

189
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,101
>> ARE YOU FRESH OUT OF SCHOOL?

190
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:24,814
>> NEW YORK I MAY IN THE LOOK
IT, BUT I'M 27.

191
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,693
>> I GUESS THE GUY THAT TOTALLY
SURPRISED ME IS VINCE.

192
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:33,197
VINCE DEFINITELY KNEW WHAT HE
WAS DOING.

193
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:33,906
HE'S EXCELLENT.

194
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,658
>> I DO STUFF LIKE THIS AT HOME.

195
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,868
LIKE BEING OUT IN THE WILD, YOU
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

196
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,203
LIKE I LIVE ON A FARM.

197
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,623
>> ELAINE, SHE'S NOT ALL PRISSY
WITH THE DRESS ON AND ALL THAT

198
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,791
KIND OF STUFF.

199
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,835
SHE'S GOT THE WORK BOOTS ON AND
THE HAT AND THE WHOLE BIT.

200
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,336
WE HIT IT OFF RIGHT AWAY.

201
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,672
>> HOW ARE YOU ALL FEELING ABOUT
THE GROUP?

202
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,174
>> A LOT OF ENERGY, A LOT OF
ENERGY.

203
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,845
>> JUST NERVOUS TO GET US TO THE
MERGE AS A TEAM.

204
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,847
WE JUST DON'T WANT TO LOSE
CHALLENGES.

205
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:03,185
THAT'S WHEN TEAMS START TO FALL
APART.

206
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,729
IT ISN'T ALWAYS THE BEST
ATHLETES.

207
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,938
IT'S WORKING TOGETHER.

208
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,815
>> WHEN I PLAYED IN THE NHL, I
WAS A CAPTAIN FOR EVERY TEAM I

209
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:08,983
PLAYED ON.

210
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:12,278
IF YOU'RE ON A TEAM AND YOU WANT
TO WIN, IT ISN'T ALL YOUR

211
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,529
PHYSICAL STRENGTH.

212
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:16,866
WAYNE GRETZKY WASN'T THE BIGGEST
GUY BUT PROBABLY THE BEST PLAYER

213
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:17,700
TO PLAY THE GAME.

214
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,201
>> I LIKE YOUR EARRING.

215
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,536
I LIKE YOU VIBE.

216
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,749
>> MY WHOLE WORLD IS ALL ABOUT
DISCIPLINE AND HARD WORK.

217
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:29,754
AND ELAINE AND I AND VIN, I
THINK WE'RE ALL THINKING THE

218
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,340
SAME WAY.

219
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,051
>> TOM AND ELAINE HAVE GONZALEZ
FOR A WHILE.

220
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,927
>> AND VIN.

221
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,679
>> WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO IN.

222
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,723
>> IF THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT TO
DO, OKAY.

223
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:44,977
>> AT THIS POINT, WE HAVE TO BE
STRONG.

224
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,729
THERE'S THREE PEOPLE MIS,
ELAINE, TOM, AND VIN.

225
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:47,813
THEY JUST LEFT.

226
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:51,359
SO EVERYBODY AT CAMP SAYS,
SEVEN, THREE, WE'RE GOOD.

227
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,902
LET'S GET BACK THE WORK.

228
00:10:52,985 --> 00:11:01,035
AND THOSE THREE IMMEDIATELY
PAINTED A TARGET ON THEIR BACKS.

229
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:08,042
>> BRING 'EM IN AND WE'LL SEE
WHAT WE GOT.

230
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:08,793
>> THAT'S NICE.

231
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:09,752
I LIKE THIS.

232
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:10,920
>> LOOK AT THAT.

233
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:11,420
THAT'S NICE.

234
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,213
>> WOW.

235
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,005
>> DUDE.

236
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:17,259
>> THE VOKAI TRIBE IS DOING
AWESOME.

237
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:17,968
IT COULD NOT BE GOING MORE WELL.

238
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,887
WE CHECK ALL THE BOXES.

239
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:20,846
WE HAVE A SHELTER.

240
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:25,601
WE HAVE FIRE, GOOD MORALE, HIGH
SPIRITS, FUN.

241
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:31,107
WE'RE CHILLING.

242
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,111
>> HEY.

243
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:39,115
>> I'M THINKING TO MYSELF, THIS
SEASON IS "ISLAND OF THE IDOLS,"

244
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:43,119
SO YOU GOT TO BE AN IDIOT NOT TO
ACTUALLY LOOK FOR AN IDOL.

245
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:47,456
>> GUYS, WHERE DID JASON GO?

246
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,749
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

247
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,794
>> MOLLY, YOU'RE VERY
PERCEPTIVE.

248
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:52,920
>> SOMETHING IS HAPPENING RIGHT
NOW.

249
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,005
>> JASON JUST DISAPPEARED.

250
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:59,135
IT WAS THE CLICHEST "SURVIVOR"
MISTAKE OF SEARCHING FOR AN IDOL

251
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,471
ON DAY ONE, SO WHEN I NOTICED
THAT JASON IS GONE, THE GOAL IS

252
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:09,645
TO SAY, WHERE'S JASON.

253
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:13,482
>> I LOOK AT MY JOB AS THOUGH I
PLAY "SURVIVOR" EVERY DAY.

254
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,984
I'M AN ACCOUNT MANAGER.

255
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,486
I RUN A TALENT MANAGEMENT
COMPANY IN HOLLYWOOD.

256
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,864
I THINK WORKING WITH ACTORS IS
VERY SIMILAR TO "SURVIVOR,"

257
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:25,286
BECAUSE I HAVE TO GET A BUNCH OF
VERY PASSIONATE AGGRESSIVE

258
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:28,497
PEOPLE THE MAKE THE DECISIONS
THAT I REALLY DO BELIEVE ARE THE

259
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:32,001
BEST DECISIONS FOR THEM AND FOR
ME, SO THERE WAS COMPLETE

260
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:36,130
STRATEGY IN NOTICING THAT JASON
HAD JUST WANDERED OFF.

261
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,465
WHY WOULD ANYONE DO THAT?

262
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,382
YOU CAN'T DISAPPEAR DAY ONE.

263
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,592
>> NO, I AGREE.

264
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,970
>> ALL I WANTED WAS A FIRST VOTE
TO BE CREATED THAT ISN'T ME.

265
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:47,725
AN I GOT TO TELL YOU, IT WAS
JOYOUS TO WATCH.

266
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:48,058
OH, HE'S DONE.

267
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,103
IT'S OVER.

268
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:54,690
SO IT IS IMPOSSIBLE NOW FOR
JASON TO DIG HIMSELF OUT OF THAT

269
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,650
GRAVE.

270
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:12,750
>> IT'S LIKE A GIANT CLAM.

271
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,918
>> WOW.

272
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,503
I'M 23 YEARS OLD, WHICH MAKES ME
THE YOUNGEST PERSON ON THE

273
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,046
TRIBE.

274
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,297
I THINK THAT'S GOOD.

275
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,925
I THINK MY PLAYFUL ATTITUDE WILL
BE WITHOUT A DOUBT MY BIGGEST

276
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,218
ASSET.

277
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:31,060
>> OH, MY GOSH, THEY'RE GOING TO
BE SO STOKED WHEN THIS COMES IN.

278
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:35,064
>> THE GOAL IS I WANT EVERYONE
TO WANT TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP

279
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,441
WITH ME.

280
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:41,737
BUT I NEED TO FIND A PERSON, AND
PERSON NUMBER ONE IS TOMMY.

281
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,364
WE'RE THE TWO YOUNG DUDES.

282
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:47,701
WE'RE VERY SIMILAR, AND THAT'S
AN OBVIOUS FREAKING PAIRING.

283
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,955
>> MY BEST FRIEND LIVES IN
VIRGINIA.

284
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:54,708
YOU COME VISIT ME AND I'LL GO
VISIT YOU AND I'LL TEACH YOU HOW

285
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:55,084
THE SURF.

286
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,252
>> EXACTLY.

287
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,962
>> AS A FOURTH GRADE TEACHER, MY
JOB IS TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE

288
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,964
FEELS COMFORTABLE AROUND ME.

289
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,090
IN THIS GAME, I'M DOING THE SAME
THING.

290
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,885
>> MY FAVORITE TEACHER OF ALL
TIME WAS MY FOURTH GRADE

291
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:05,219
TEACHER.

292
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,095
>> REALLY?

293
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:06,971
MINE TOO.

294
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,931
MY FOURTH GRADE TEACHER CHANGED
MY LIFE.

295
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,268
>> MY STRATEGY IS TO CONNECT
WITH PEOPLE IN ONE-ON-ONE

296
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,644
CONVERSATIONS AND GET TO KNOW
WHO THEY ARE.

297
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:14,812
>> I'M 26.

298
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,022
I'VE BEEN DATING MY GIRLFRIEND
FOR THREE YEARS.

299
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,274
>> AWESOME.

300
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:18,857
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

301
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:19,984
>> I'M GOING TO PROPOSE.

302
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:20,943
I BOUGHT THE RING.

303
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,736
>> YOU ARE?

304
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,947
OH.

305
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,282
>> IT'S GREAT.

306
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,743
>> AND IT'S REALLY WORKING.

307
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:30,911
EVERYONE HAS BEEN COMING UP TO
ME.

308
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,455
I THINK I DID A GREAT JOB OF
CONNECTING WITH PEOPLE ONE ON

309
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,126
ONE, AN I'M BUILDING A LOT OF
ALLIANCES.

310
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,461
>> WE MEAD PEOPLE WE CAN TRUST.

311
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:43,340
>> ABSOLUTELY.

312
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,259
>> I REALLY LIKE JAMAL A LOT.

313
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,468
>> YEAH.

314
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:51,307
>> ALL ALREADY I CAN SEE THE COR
GROUP FORMED WHICH IS GREAT,

315
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,224
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE THE
PERSON ON THE OUTS.

316
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,310
WE KIND OF JUST CLICKED.

317
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,853
WE WANT TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

318
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,771
WE NEED TO GET RID OF THE DRAMA.

319
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,481
WE NEED TO GET RID OF THE
SLIMINESS.

320
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,691
THIS IS A TRIBE GAME.

321
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,152
LET'S MAKE THIS EASY AND JASON
IS THE PERSON WHO IS RUNNING

322
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,029
AROUND TRYING TO DO SOMETHING
FOR HIMSELF.

323
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,489
IT'S A LITTLE SHADY TO EVERYONE
ELSE.

324
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,366
IT RUBBED PEOPLE THE WRONG WAY.

325
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,994
>> SO JASON.

326
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,205
>> IT'S ANNOYING AND UPSETTING
AND WHATEVER, BUT I'M GRATEFUL

327
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,207
FOR IT BECAUSE IT'S THE MOST
UNIFYING THING.

328
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:23,005
WE ALL AGREE ABOUT THIS.

329
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,632
>> THEY THINK YOU HAVE AN IDOL.

330
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,257
>> WHY DO THEY THINK THAT?

331
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,176
>> I REALLY DON'T.

332
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,429
WE'VE BEEN OUT HERE FOR LIKE AN
HOUR.

333
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,680
HOW WOULD I FIND AN IDOL.

334
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:37,645
>> I AM THINKING, I LIKE THE GUY
AND I WANT THE WORK WITH HIM.

335
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,064
HE ALSO FEELS FAMILIAR TO ME AND
HE REMINDS ME OF AN EX-BOYFRIEND

336
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:43,525
THAT I FEEL IS AN AUTHENTIC GOOD
GUY I CAN TRUST.

337
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,028
I FELT LIKE THAT, AND I WANT TO
WORK WITH THAT.

338
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,614
SO WHAT'S THE FIRST THING I DO.

339
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,198
I GO TO HIM AND TELL HIM.

340
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,450
>> THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

341
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:55,204
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW, BECAUSE
PERCEPTION IS REALITY.

342
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:59,333
>> SHE SAYS, HEY, I WANT TO GIVE
YOU A HEADS UP, THERE'S TALK AND

343
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,794
CHATTER THAT I LEFT CAMP FOR 30
OR 40 MINUTES.

344
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,920
SO I'M CONCERNED.

345
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:07,424
IS THERE ANY PERSON THAT WOULD
BE MORE OF A LIABILITY AND

346
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,135
DISTRUSTFUL THAN SOMEBODY THAT
WOULD GO SEARCH FOR THE HIDDEN

347
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,261
IMMUNITY IDOL DAY ONE?

348
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,721
I AM MORTIFIED.

349
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,556
AM I GOING TO BE THE FIRST ONE
OUT?

350
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:23,065
THAT IS MY NIGHTMARE.

351
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,568
>> REMIND ME TO PUT MY DRAWERS
ON.

352
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,028
IF NOT I'LL GO COMMANDO.

353
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:28,696
>> THAT'S OKAY.

354
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,448
>> I'LL BE IN THE FREE WORLD.

355
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:35,077
I HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT MY WHOLE
LIFE, AND I GOT PICKED ON A LOT,

356
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,621
SO I USE HUMOR TO DEFLECT.

357
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,206
I MAKE 'EM LAUGH.

358
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,583
THAT WAY THEY'RE LAUGHING WITH
ME AND IN THE AT ME.

359
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:45,462
>> YOU PUT SOME CUMIN?

360
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,588
WHAT IS THAT?

361
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,132
>> CONSUME SEASON LIKE A
YELLOW-REDDISH SPICE THAT YOU

362
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,049
PUT IN FOOD.

363
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,343
YOU PUT IT ON WHATEVER YOU WANT,
A COCONUT?

364
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:56,140
>> I AIN'T NEVER HEARD THAT.

365
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,141
>> THE LIMO DROPPED HER OFF.

366
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,269
>> LIKE GREY POUPON.

367
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,479
>> GREY POUPON.

368
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,441
>> WE DON'T HAVE THAT.

369
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,525
>> THAT'S MUSTARD.

370
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,611
>> THAT'S WHAT CUMIN IS.

371
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,115
>> I TRY TO BE THE MOST
OBSERVANT IN THIS GAME, AND

372
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,159
LOOKING AROUND AT THE OTHER
PLAYERS, I LIKE THE GIRLS,

373
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:19,288
BECAUSE IT SEEMS AS THOUGH ALL
FOUR OF THE OTHER WOMEN FEEL

374
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,290
THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE
SUBSERVIENT AND THEY'RE NOT

375
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,209
GOING TO DO WHAT PEOPLE EXPECT
THEM TO DO.

376
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,169
THEY'RE GOING TO DO WHAT MOST
BENEFITS THEM.

377
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:30,758
>> DON'T SLAM INTO THE TREE.

378
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,135
AND IN THIS MOMENT, WHAT
BENEFITS ALL THE GIRLS IS

379
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,303
FORMING A WOMEN'S ALLIANCE.

380
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,597
>> I'M DOWN FOR DOING A GIRL'S
THING.

381
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,598
>> PERFECT.

382
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,850
>> I'M ALL ABOUT THE GIRL POWER.

383
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,435
WE NEED TO HAVE EACH OTHER'S
BACKS.

384
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,937
>> I'M TIRED OF GIRLS GOING OUT
FIRST.

385
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:44,605
WHAT IS THAT?

386
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,564
WHY IS THAT?

387
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,317
>> KEEPING THE WOMEN STRONG IS
SUPER IMPORTANT.

388
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,819
>> LET'S GRAB A GUY.

389
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:55,157
>> I KNOW PEOPLE THINK ELAINE,
TOM, AND VINCE ARE TOGETHER, AND

390
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,162
BECAUSE OF THAT, ELAINE COULD
POSSIBLY BE IN TROUBLE.

391
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,288
>> THEY WAS ALREADY TALKING
TRASH, HUH?

392
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:06,376
>> EVERYBODY LOOKED UP AND
COUNTED IN THEIR HEAD, 7-3.

393
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,338
IT'S JUST LIKE AN EASY WAY TO
MAKE A TARGET.

394
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,507
>> OH, YEAH.

395
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,176
>> WELL, WE WAS CUTTING DOWN
TREES.

396
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,219
THAT'S OKAY.

397
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,304
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

398
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,681
THAT GOT ME A LITTLE WORRIED.

399
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,226
WHEN YOU FIRST HEAR ANYBODY SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR NAME, IT

400
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,477
MAKE YOUR HEART RACE.

401
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,897
YOU DON'T WANT YOUR NAME TO COME
UP IN "SURVIVOR" EVER AT ALL.

402
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,859
SO I NEED TO START PLAYING A
LITTLE BETTER GAME, BECAUSE I'M

403
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,986
NOT OKAY WITH GOING HOME.

404
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,337
>> WHAT DO YOU NEED ME TO DO?

405
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,224
>> WHAT IS GOING ON?

406
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,767
IT'S A MASSAGE PARLOR.

407
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,686
>> OH, DAN IS SO GOOD.

408
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:08,564
>> YOU KNOW, IN THE GAME OF
"SURVIVOR," THERE IS A LOT OF

409
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,817
PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE LIVING WITH
FOR THE FIRST TIME, LIVING WITH

410
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,946
ANYONE IS HARD, AND I'M A
GERMOPHOBE WHEN IT COMES TO

411
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:19,908
OTHER PEOPLE'S GROSSNESS.

412
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,994
>> RIGHT HERE?

413
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,370
>> OH, MY GOD.

414
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:27,583
A COMBINATION OF HUMAN AND
SLIGHTLY MORE ELEVATED.

415
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,794
IF IT GETS TOO THE HEAVY, LET ME
KNOW.

416
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,504
>> ARE YOU SWEATING ON MY LEG?

417
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:36,592
>> I DO GET ANNOYED WITH DAN,
BECAUSE DAN IS A REALLY TOUCHY

418
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:42,014
PERSON.

419
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,432
REMAKES ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.

420
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,392
I DON'T THINK HE REALIZES IT.

421
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:48,770
HIS LACK OF SPATIAL AWARENESS,
FOR ME BEING A GERMOPHOBE, BUT

422
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,566
ALSO A GIRL, I'M LIKE, DAN, I
DON'T WANT YOUR HEAD ON MY LEG.

423
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,942
LIKE THAT'S JUST TOO MUCH.

424
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,403
LIKE I DON'T WANT YOUR SWEATY
BODY ON ME AT ALL.

425
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,447
>> OH, MY GOD.

426
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:04,786
THAT 2012 SUPER BOWL WHERE THE
GIANTS CAME BECOME AND BEAT THE

427
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,621
PATRIOTS.

428
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,581
>> I WAS TAKEN ABACK BY DAN AT
FIRST.

429
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,832
HE'S REALLY TOUCHY.

430
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,793
DAN DOES NOT KNOW PERSONAL
SPACE.

431
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:15,339
>> DAN HAS BEEN MAKING ME FEEL
UNCOMFORTABLE.

432
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,674
I DON'T WANT TO CAUSE ANY
PROBLEMS.

433
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,594
I THINK DAN IS AN EASIER PERSON
TO HAVE ON YOUR SIDE.

434
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:23,013
I'M TRYING TO BE DELICATE,
BECAUSE IT IS A GAME, AND I

435
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:26,475
DON'T WANT THE RUFFLE FEATHERS
FOR AS LONG AS I POSSIBLY CAN.

436
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,311
IF YOU GET YOURSELF INTO A HOLE
EARLY, IT'S HARD THE CLIMB OUT

437
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,312
OF IT.

438
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,439
DAN IS VERY TOUCHY.

439
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:32,940
>> YEAH.

440
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:33,482
>> IT'S LIKE, A LOT.

441
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,985
>> IT'S TOO MUCH FOR ME.

442
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,154
>> IT'S TOO MUCH FOR MOLLY, TOO.

443
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:43,325
>> THE GIRLS ARE VERY
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH DAN'S

444
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,493
PHYSICALITY WITH THEM.

445
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:50,040
I HAVE LEARNED AS A WOMAN, YOU
NEED TO SAY WHAT YOU THINK.

446
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:53,877
>> I FEEL LIKE I'VE TOTALLY
RECOGNIZED LIKE LOVE LANGUAGE IS

447
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:58,215
YOUR WAY OF SHOWING THAT YOU
CARE, SO FOR ME, I'M LIKE, I'M

448
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,675
JUST LIKE... YOU KNOW?

449
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:04,513
I'M NOT TRYING TO REJECT, THAT I
JUST COME FROM SUCH A DIFFERENT

450
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,681
PLACE.

451
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,516
>> I HAVE TO BE OPEN TO I'M
NOT -- I HAVE TO BE, OH, GOD SHE

452
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,853
DOESN'T LIKE ME BECAUSE I CAN'T
HUGGER THE WAY JANET CAN.

453
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:12,521
I GET IT.

454
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:18,819
>> THAT'S NOT -- HOPEFULLY...

455
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,238
WE'RE PLAYING "SURVIVOR" WHERE
IT'S ABOUT CONNECTING, BUT DAN

456
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:25,701
BEING A TOUCHY PERSON, IT'S A
LOT.

457
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:29,204
WE KIND OF TALKED ABOUT IT AND
WE HAD A REALLY GOOD

458
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:33,417
CONVERSATION, BUT I FEEL LIKE
DAN'S LACK OF SPATIAL AWARENESS

459
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,504
IS GOING TO HURT HIM IN THE
GAME.

460
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,214
>> HOW YOU DOING, GIRL?

461
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,382
>> I'M DOING ALL RIGHT.

462
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,550
>> ARE YOU FEELING HUNGRY OR
ANYTHING?

463
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,677
>> NOT REALLY.

464
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,386
I GOT A LOT OF INSULATION.

465
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,555
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

466
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:53,520
US BIGGER PEOPLE, WE'RE PROBABLY
GOING THE LAST.

467
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,604
HE'S ALREADY STARVING TO DEATH.

468
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:57,065
I SEE HIS BACKBONE.

469
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,068
WHEN YOU PASS OUT, WE'LL GET A
WOMAN OVER THERE TO GIVE YOU

470
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,236
MOUTH TO MOUTH.

471
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:04,740
>> THE BIGGEST TIP I GIVE TO
OTHER POKER PLAYERS IS SIT DOWN

472
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:05,907
AND WATCH.

473
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,118
WATCH WHAT OTHER PLAYERS ARE
BRINGING TO THE GAME.

474
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:12,539
I CAN SEE THAT ELAINE IS
EXTREMELY LIKABLE.

475
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:13,874
SHE'S SUPER FUN.

476
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:14,791
I LIKE ELAINE.

477
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,419
THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS.

478
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,463
SOMEONE LIKE ELAINE FROM A TOWN
FROM THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE

479
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:25,427
KENTUCKY WHO HAS HAD HARDSHIP
HER WHO LIFE AND WHO WORKS IN A

480
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,636
FACTORY, SOUNDS LIKE A CLEAR
WINNER TO ME.

481
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,223
>> I LIKE YOU, FROM FIRST TIME I
SEEN YOU, I KNOW YOU'RE SOLID.

482
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,935
IF SHE'S GOTTEN THAT FAR WITH
THAT STORY, THEY'LL AWARD HER

483
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,562
THAT $1 MILLION.

484
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:36,605
LIKE MYSELF, YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
A LOT.

485
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:41,151
I'VE WITHIN IN YOUR EYE, WE
UNDERSTAND THE STRUGGLE.

486
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:45,155
SO SHE'S SOMEBODY I WANT TO GET
RID OF AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

487
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:48,533
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO PUT OUT
GOOD VIBES, GOOD VIBE RON, TO

488
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,161
MAKE ELAINE FEEL SAFE.

489
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,162
IF SOMEBODY IS THROWING YOUR
NAME OUT, THERE I'LL LET YOU

490
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,413
KNOW ON THE LOW.

491
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:53,955
AND WE'LL JUST TALK.

492
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:58,126
>> OKAY.

493
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,129
AS LONG AS YOU STAY REAL WITH
ME, I'LL STAY REAL WITH YOU.

494
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,339
I TRUST YOU 100%.

495
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:05,175
>> I LITERALLY KNEW FROM THE
MINUTE THAT I HAD THE

496
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,469
CONVERSATION WITH RONNIE, I KNEW
THAT ME AND HIM WAS LIKE THIS.

497
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,971
I KNEW IT IN MY GUT.

498
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:14,142
HE IS A WEASEL, AND HE'S
SOMEBODY WHO I FIND SHADY.

499
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,310
I DON'T TRUST RONNIE.

500
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,145
SO ME HE HAS TO GO.

501
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,148
>> I'M TRYING TO PLAY A SOLID
GAME AND RIDE TO THE END WITH

502
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,024
PEOPLE I TRUST.

503
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,485
>> IT'S GAME TIME, YOU KNOW WHAT
I MEAN?

504
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,362
GUNS DRAWN.

505
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:28,615
LET'S FIND OUT.

506
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,172
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

507
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:58,061
>> I'M GETTING MY FIRST LOOK AT
THE TWO TRIBES.

508
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,021
>> Jeff: WELCOME.

509
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:05,777
ALL RIGHT.

510
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:11,449
LET ME OFFICIALLY WELCOME YOU TO

00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:20,855
VOKAI, GREAT WORK AS A TRIPE

690
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:23,024
CHALLENGE.

691

NICE JOB.

692
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,737
FLINT.

693
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,196
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM VOKAI.

694
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,072
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

695
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,198
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

696
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:38,247
AND ENJOY THE NIGHT.

697
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:43,544
ALL RIGHT.

698
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,254
LAIRO, TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT

699
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,006
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

700
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,343
BEFORE I SEND YOU BACK TO CAMP,
ONE MORE THING.

701
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,387
"ISLAND OF THE IDOLS" DOES
EXIST, AND ONE OF YOU IS ABOUT

702
00:32:52,470 --> 00:33:01,062
TO BE THE FIRST PERSON TO
EXPERIENCE IT.

703
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,271
ALL TEN OF YOUR NAMES ARE IN
THIS BAG.

704
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:06,859
THE ONE DRAWN WILL BE THE FIRST
PERSON TO GO TO "ISLAND OF THE

705
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:07,360
IDOLS."

706
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:10,738
WHO WANTS THE DRAW?

707
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,823
>> GO AHEAD.

708
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,241
>> Jeff: WHATEVER YOU PULL
OUT, THAT PERSON IS GOING TO

709
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:20,248
"ISLAND OF THE IDOLS."

710
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,126
>> WE'RE A TEAM, GUYS.

711
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:30,258
>> Jeff: ELIZABETH, WHAT'S THE
REACTION?

712
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,136
>> YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE
HARD BEING OUT THERE ALONE.

713
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:36,264
BUT I KNOW I CAN ABSOLUTELY
HANDLE IT.

714
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,307
ELIZABETH, YOU WILL BE THE FIRST
PERSON GOING TO "ISLAND OF THE

715
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,100
IDOLS."

716
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,269
YOU WILL RETURN BACK TO YOUR
CAMP.

717
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:44,272
YOU WILL BE GOING THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL TONIGHT.

718
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,566
HEAD OUT.

719
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:47,358
THE BOAT IS WAITING FOR YOU.

720
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,277
>> WE'LL SEE YOU WHEN YOU GET
BACK.

721
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,279
>> YEP.

722
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,157
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, LAIRO,
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

723
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,908
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

724
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,285
>> I AM FREAKING OUT.

725
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,163
I DON'T WANT TO GO, BECAUSE ME
GOING TO "ISLAND OF THE IDOLS"

726
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:04,375
PUTS TARGET ON MY BACK, AND ON
TOP OF, THAT I'M MISSING

727
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,335
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT
STRATEGIZING TIME WITH THE

728
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,255
TRIBE, AND I DON'T THINK
"SURVIVOR" GODS ARE GOING TO

729
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:14,302
MAKE IT EASY, SO IT'S SCARY, AN
I'M LIKE, WHAT'S IN STORE FOR

730
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,387
ME.

731
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,074
>> "ISLAND OF THE IDOLS."

732
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,242
I'M TRYING THE STAY OPTIMISTIC
HERE.

733
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,495
THIS BEACH IS ONE OF THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL PLACES I HAVE EVER

734
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,705
SEEN.

735
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:47,710
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING
THE WALK INTO.

736
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,379
>> WHERE AM I?

737
00:34:50,463 --> 00:35:04,852
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

738
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,688
>> THAT IS SO COOL.

739
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:11,025
I SEE THESE TWO MASSIVE STATUES.

740
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:12,902
NO WAY.

741
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:16,405
AND I'M LIKE, BOSTON ROB AND
SANDRA, TWO OF THE BEST PLAYERS

742
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:23,538
TO EVER PLAY THIS GAME.

743
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,372
>> WELCOME.

744
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,165
>> WHAT?

745
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,542
NO WAY!

746
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:31,379
AND THEN OUT COMES WALKING
BOSTON ROB AND SANDRA.

747
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:31,838
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

748
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:35,216
>> HOW ARE YOU?

749
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,551
BOSTON ROB
>> HOW ARE YOU?

750
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,886
>> REALLY GOOD NOW.

751
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:44,267
I WAS SO EXCITED, SURPRISED,
JUST IN SAW, BECAUSE THEY ARE

752
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:44,892
IDOLS.

753
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,894
THEY ARE "SURVIVOR" IDOLS.

754
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,397
>> COME ON UP AND WE'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S GOING ON.

755
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,359
>> ALL RIGHT.

756
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:57,405
FIRST THINGS FIRST, THE OATH OF
THE IDOL, WE ARE THE SURVIVOR

757
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:57,905
IDOL.

758
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,157
WE'RE NOT COMPETEING.

759
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,368
WE DO NOT VOTE, WE CANNOT WIN
THE $1 MILLION PRIZE.

760
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:07,206
OUR JOB IS TO MENTOR YOU IN THE
GAME OF "SURVIVOR" AND THEN

761
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,209
OFFER YOU A CHANCE TO TEST WHAT
YOU HAVE LEARNED.

762
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:14,422
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS HERE IS
INTENDED TO MAKE YOU A BETTER

763
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,464
SURVIVOR PLAYER.

764
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:19,385
YOU CAN THINK OF THIS PLACE AS A
"SURVIVOR" BOOTCAMP.

765
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:24,432
SANDRA AND I HAVE A PRETTY
EXTENSIVE "SURVIVOR" RESUME.

766
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:27,560
WE'VE PLAYED OVER 200 DAYS,
SEVEN SEASONS.

767
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:28,394
>> HE'S A STUPID ASS.

768
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:31,063
>> WE'VE BOTH WON THE GAME.

769
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:36,277
>> THE WINNER OF "SURVIVOR:
REDEMPTION ISLAND."

770
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,572
>> WE'VE ALSO LOST THE GAME.

771
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,781
>> DON'T DO IT, JEFF.

772
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:41,782
DON'T DO IT, JEFF.

773
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,619
>> WE UNDERSTAND EVERY COMPONENT
OF THIS GAME.

774
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,413
YOU ARE HERE TO GET AS MUCH
KNOWLEDGE AS YOU CAN FROM US AND

775
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:48,289
USE IT AS YOUR WILL.

776
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,625
>> I LITERALLY HAVE THE CHILLS
RIGHT NOW.

777
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:51,834
I'M SO EXCITED.

778
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:56,964
>> WHOEVER COMES TO ISLAND OF
THE IDOLLING WE WILL SIT DOWN

779
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,759
AND TALK TO THEM, ASK THEM ABOUT
THEIR "SURVIVOR" EXPERIENCE THUS

780
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:00,968
FAR.

781
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,472
THEN GIVE IDEAS AND STRATEGY TO
HELP THEM FURTHER THEIR GAME.

782
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:08,309
>> DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE IN A
GOOD ALLIANCE.

783
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,352
>> I FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT IT.

784
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,979
>> WHAT ABOUT SHELTER?

785
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:12,438
>> WE HAVE A SHELTER.

786
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,315
WE HAVE NO FIRE.

787
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,483
WE CAN'T COOK THE RICE.

788
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,026
WE CAN'T FISH.

789
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:20,863
>> SO YOU CAN CATCH FISH, BUT
YOU DON'T HAVE A FIRE TO BE ABLE

790
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,615
TO COOK IT.

791
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,450
SINCE YOU'RE GOING THE TRIBAL
COUNCIL TONIGHT, YOU'RE GOING TO

792
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,201
COME BACK WITH FLINT.

793
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,536
I CAN TEACH YOU HOW TO MAKE
FIRE.

794
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,120
>> YEAH.

795
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,288
>> WOULD YOU LIKE THAT?

796
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,873
>> I WOULD LOVE THAT.

797
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,500
>> IT TAKES BASICALLY THREE
ELEMENTS TO MAKE FIRE.

798
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:38,339
YOU NEED FUEL, WHICH IS WOOD,
YOU NEED A SPARK, WHICH WILL BE

799
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:42,468
YOUR FLINT, AND YOU NEED AIR,
RIGHT?

800
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:45,179
WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A FIRE
SEPARATE, BUT THEN WE'RE GOING

801
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:50,184
THE TRANSFER IT, BECAUSE IT'S
ALREADY THAT WHAT YOU HAVE.

802
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,521
THE BEST TEACHERS I HAVE HAD
THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF MY LIFE

803
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:58,150
WERE ONES THAT SHOWED ME HOW TO
DO THINGS BY DOING THEM

804
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,193
THEMSELVES.

805
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,154
THIS IS FLINT.

806
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,030
THAT'S MAGNESIUM.

807
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,199
YOU SHAVE THE MAGNESIUM OFF.

808
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:07,535
THAT'S THE REASON WE'RE OUT HERE
ON THE ISLAND.

809
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:12,164
IF WE'RE GOING THE TALK THE
TALK, WE HAVE TO WALK THE WALK.

810
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:16,210
>> YOU SEE HOW HE'S GRABBING THE
FLINT IN BETWEEN THE THUMB AND

811
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:16,711
THE FINGER NICE AND TIGHT.

812
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:21,716
>> BRING YOUR HEAD IN.

813
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:26,220
>> OH, MY GOD.

814
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:27,555
AND IT'S THAT EASY.

815
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:27,847
WANT THE TRY?

816
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,016
>> I DO.

817
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:30,725
I WOULD LOVE THE TRY.

818
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,852
>> OKAY, COME ON.

819
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,813
>> EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS ON
THE ISLAND OF THE IDOLS IS A

820
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:36,564
LESSON.

821
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:41,652
>> GRAB YOUR THINGS AND FOLLOW
ME.

822
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:41,902
>> OKAY.

823
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,112
OKAY.

824
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,238
>> EVEN THOUGH ELIZABETH COMES
FULL OFEN JOY, READY TO LEARN,

825
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:57,460
IN THE BACK OF MY MIND, I KNOW
THAT THE TEST IS COMING.

826
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:58,044
>> NOPE.

827
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,421
>> LET'S START ALL OVER.

828
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:04,592
YOU'RE HITTING IT, BUT I DON'T
SEE THAT YOU'RE SCRAPING

829
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:05,551
ANYTHING.

830
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:11,599
REMEMBER, MAGNESIUM IS
EVERYTHING.

831
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,808
PUT THIS IN.

832
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:16,270
WHEN YOU THROW THE MAGNESIUM
THERE N, THERE YOU WANT IT TO BE

833
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:17,938
ONE SPOT, LIKE A BUN.

834
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:25,613
>> LIKE A BUN.

835
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,656
>> I'M JUST SCRATCHING IT.

836
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,741
SEE ALL THAT STUFF IN THERE?

837
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:32,912
BY MY THIRD OR FOURTH TRY --
>> IT'S GOING THE LIGHT.

838
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:36,165
>> IT'S GOING TO LIGHT.

839
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:36,624
THERE IT IS.

840
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,792
THERE IT IS, BABY.

841
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:38,584
THERE IT IS.

842
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:39,251
NOW KEEP GOING.

843
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,086
>> LET'S GO.

844
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,712
LET'S GO.

845
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:42,296
SANDRA!

846
00:39:42,379 --> 00:39:43,380
>> WE NEED WOOD ON THERE.

847
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,132
WE NEED A TEPEE OF WOOD.

848
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,634
THROW SOME MORE HUSK IN THERE IF
YOU NEED TO.

849
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,636
THAT A NICE FIRE IF I EVER SAW
ONE.

850
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:54,475
>> WE GOT FIRE, BABY!

851
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,684
THIS IS SO COOL, SANDRA.

852
00:39:55,768 --> 00:40:02,650
THAT WAS BECAUSE OF YOU.

853
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,485
>> HOW DID IT GO?

854
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:07,321
>> I GOT IT THANKS TO SANDRA.

855
00:40:07,404 --> 00:40:08,489
OH, MAN.

856
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:12,159
>> WE TOLD YOU THERE WOULD BE AN
OPPORTUNITY TO TEST WHAT YOU

857
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,619
LEARNED TO GET AN ADVANTAGE IN
THIS GAME.

858
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:16,997
THERE ARE TWO FIRE-MAKING
STATIONS.

859
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:21,836
IF YOU MAKE FIRE FIRST, YOU EARN
AN IMMUNITY IDOL GOOD FOR YOUR

860
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,712
NEXT TWO TRIBAL COUNCILS.

861
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:28,968
IF YOU LOSE, YOU LOSE YOUR VOTED
FOR TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL.

862
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:31,554
THE QUESTION IS, ARE YOU
CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO TAKE THE

863
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:38,352
RISK OR WILL YOU PLAY IT SAFE
AND RETURN TO CAMP?

864
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:40,187
>> I NEED TO THINK.

865
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,022
>> I'M HAPPY THAT YOU'RE
THINKING.

866
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:42,648
YOU KNOW, IT'S A TOUGH DECISION.

867
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:44,942
>> I KNOW.

868
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:47,027
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I HAVE NO
IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON BACK AT

869
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:47,528
CAMP.

870
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,445
>> RIGHT.

871
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,198
YOU SAID YOU WERE IN A GOOD
ALLIANCE, RIGHT?

872
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:55,494
SO YOUR VOTE MIGHT NOT EVEN
MATTER TONIGHT.

873
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:59,206
>> ELIZABETH AGAINST BOSTON ROB
IS A MISMATCH.

874
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,001
NO ONE KNOWS THE GAME OF
"SURVIVOR" BETTER THANS BE ROB

875
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,335
AND MYSELF.

876
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,170
BUT THIS IS "SURVIVOR."

877
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,505
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN.

878
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,924
SHE'S LEARNING FROM THE BEST.

879
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:15,556
SO MAYBE SHE COULD BEAT BOSTONéú
WHAT IS YOUR GUT TELLING YOU?

880
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:26,066
>> DO YOU WANT TO GO FOR IT?

881
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,276
>> A QUICK LITTLE POWWOW.

882
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,070
WE SAID AT THE START WE WERE
GOING TO DO THIS AS THE TEAM, SO

883
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,197
THE THREE PEOPLE THAT DO THE
PUZZLE...

884
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,198
>> IT'S CHECK TVLY OR FAULT.

885
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:35,117
>> IT'S NOT ALL Y'ALL.

886
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:39,163
WE PROBABLY PUT MORE PRESSURE ON
Y'ALL THAN WE SHOULD.

887
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:43,542
>> LET'S GET WATER, FIREWOOD AND
IF WE HAVE TIME...

888
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,793
>> WE HAVE WATER.

889
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,587
>> I'M WORRIED ABOUT GOING INTO
TRIBAL COUNCIL, BECAUSE I STILL

890
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:50,132
FEEL LIKE MY NAME IS OUT, THERE
BUT I'M BANKING ON

891
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:50,966
RELATIONSHIPS, ON CONNECTIONS.

892
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:55,262
THAT'S WHAT I'M BANKING ON.

893
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,598
>> WHAT ARE WE DOING TONIGHT?

894
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,849
>> FOUR OF US.

895
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:02,895
>> IF YOU COULD PICK ONE PERSON
RIGHT NOW, WHO WOULD YOU WANT

896
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:05,147
OUT?

897
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:05,731
>> RONNIE.

898
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:07,107
>> RONNIE.

899
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:07,441
DON'T TRUST HIM.

900
00:42:07,524 --> 00:42:08,567
>> RONNIE?

901
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:16,116
>> I'M -- WE HAVE ELIZABETH, AN
WE HAVE THAT FOR SURE.

902
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:16,784
>> YEAH.

903
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:20,287
>> I THINK Y'ALL WANT STRENGTH.

904
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:24,583
I THINK THE GUYS WILL GO FOR...

905
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,460
>> WE THINK WE HAVE SIX FOR
SURE.

906
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:27,795
>> YEAH.

907
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:28,796
>> PUT THE SIX ON RONNIE.

908
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,590
>> I THINK THAT'S A GOOD PLAN.

909
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:35,594
>> AT THE MOMENT I'M WORKING
WITH TOM, CHELSEA, AND ELAINE TO

910
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:40,099
VOTE AGAINST RONNIE, BUT I FEEL
THAT MY NAME IS ON THE CHOPPING

911
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:43,102
BLOCK BECAUSE THE PUZZLE DIDN'T
COME TOGETHER, AND THAT'S WHERE

912
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:45,062
IT GETS ME REALLY WORRIED.

913
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,481
>> WE GOT TO TALK.

914
00:42:47,564 --> 00:42:49,316
>> THIS IS ABOUT TO GET REAL.

915
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,693
>> WE NEED THE START TALKING.

916
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:53,070
>> HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

917
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:53,821
, KARISHMA?

918
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:54,822
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?

919
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,156
>> I'M WITH YOU GUYS.

920
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,450
I WILL VOTE HOWEVER YOU GUYS
WANT TO VOTE.

921
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:01,036
>> WE HAVE FOUR HERE NOW.

922
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,999
>> HOW YOU FEELING, MAN?

923
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,501
WE NEED YOU RIGHT NOW TO
STRATEGIZE WITH US.

924
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,838
ELIZABETH WILL COME BACK FROM
ISLAND OF IDOLS.

925
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:13,173
YOU THINK YOU TAKE YOUR VOICE TO
HER?

926
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,925
>> I'LL TELL HER.

927
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:19,346
>> THAT'S SIX.

928
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,474
I FEEL LIKE ELAINE.

929
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,852
DOES ELAINE MAKE SENSE AT THIS
STAGE IN THE GAME?

930
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:25,894
SHE'S A SWEETHEART.

931
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:28,897
>> I WANT THE KEEP HER IN THE
LOOP.

932
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:31,317
>> ELAINE'S NAME CAME UP A
COUPLE TIME.

933
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,194
>> SHE IS A SOCIAL BUTTERFLY
>> I'M DEFINITELY CONCERNED

934
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,404
ABOUT ELAINE.

935
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:39,199
SHE IS HILARIOUS, AND SHE IS IN
THE HERE TO BE THE COMEDIAN.

936
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,368
SHE'S HERE TO WIN $1 MILLION.

937
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:46,373
BUT THE FIRST ALLIANCE THAT I
MADE WAS WITH ELAINE, AND THE

938
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:46,874
WOMEN.

939
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,167
I'M SO TORN RIGHT NOW.

940
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:52,546
>> I THINK IDEA IS CONTINUE THE
FEEL PEOPLE OUT, GET FIREWOOD.

941
00:43:52,629 --> 00:43:53,714
>> THEY WANT TO TARGET ELAINE.

942
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:57,509
I DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN THAT
ROUTE WITH THEM.

943
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,011
THEY WERE SAYING YOU.

944
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:01,472
LIKE I'M TELLING Y'ALL
EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING TO

945
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:01,847
HAPPEN.

946
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:02,723
>> NO, MAN.

947
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,391
I TOTALLY TRUST ELAINE.

948
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,894
AND I THINK SHE HAS MY BACK, AS
WELL.

949
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:10,522
SO I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT
ELAINE DOESN'T GET THE SHORT END

950
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,192
OF THE STICK HERE.

951
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:13,942
>> THEY'RE THROWING OUT YOUR
NAME.

952
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,528
>> THEY'RE TRYING TO DO
ANYTHING.

953
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:17,696
THEY DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS.

954
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,574
THEY'RE TRYING TO COME UP WITH
ALL THESE DIFFERENT NAMES SO

955
00:44:20,657 --> 00:44:21,575
PEOPLE JUMP IN WITH THEM.

956
00:44:21,658 --> 00:44:22,242
>> OKAY.

957
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,243
I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

958
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,746
>> THE BOTTOM LINE IS THEY'RE
ALL VOTING MY NAME.

959
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:26,330
>> RIGHT.

960
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:28,123
>> I KNEW IT IN MY GUT.

961
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:28,957
I'M IN TROUBLE.

962
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,794
I'M GOING HOME.

963
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:34,880
I WANT THE TRY TO STAY.

964
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:39,426
I'M GOING THE PRAY TO STAY AND
PRAY THAT THINGS WORK OUT.

965
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:46,600
IT MAY NOT BE IN GOD'S PLAN.

966
00:44:46,683 --> 00:44:48,394
>> WHAT IS YOUR GUT TELLING YOU?

967
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:54,775
>> ROB GIVES ME THE OFFER TO
BASICALLY GO UP AGAINST HIM IN A

968
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:58,737
FIRE-MAKING CHALLENGE, AND IF I
WIN I GET AN IMMUNITY-MAKING

969
00:44:58,821 --> 00:44:59,321
IDOL.

970
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,447
IF I LOSE, I LOSE A VOTE.

971
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,158
SO IT'S A HUGE RISK.

972
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,494
>>S BE ROB IS PROBABLY THE BEST
FIRE MAKER IN THIS WORLD.

973
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:06,954
HE'S DONE HUNDREDS OF FIRES.

974
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:11,458
AND IN MY HEART, I AM JUST
THINKING, IT'S GOING TO BE VERY

975
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,502
HARD TO WIN.

976
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:18,173
BUT THE COMPETITOR IN ME IS
IGNITED.

977
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:21,135
>> YOU WANT TO GO FOR IT?

978
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:25,931
>> YEAH.

979
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:26,640
>> ALL RIGHT.

980
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:27,141
>> YES.

981
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,475
>> LET'S GO FOR IT.

982
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,060
>> OH, MY GOD.

983
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:34,523
>> SHE TOOK THE FIRST OFFER, NOT
EVEN THINKING TO QUESTION IF I

984
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,775
MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING IN MY BACK
POCKET.

985
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:42,656
I WAS PREPARED TO UP THE ANTE,
BUT LIKE EVERY NEW "SURVIVOR"

986
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:44,032
PLAYER, THEY BITE AT FIRST
OPPORTUNITY.

987
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,993
YOU READY IN
>> YEAH.

988
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,035
>> ALL RIGHT, SANDRA, COUNT US
DOWN.

989
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:55,294
>> OKAY, THREE, TWO, ONE, GO.

990
00:45:55,377 --> 00:46:00,132
>> PUT THIS INTO A LITTLE NEST.

991
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:04,511
THROW SOME MORE HUSK IN THERE IF
YOU NEED TO.

992
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:05,304
DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM.

993
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:08,682
KEEP GOING.

994
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:09,600
MORE MAGNESIUM.

995
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:11,310
THERE YOU GO, THERE YOU GO,
THERE YOU GO.

996
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:11,894
YOU GOT IT.

997
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:13,353
>> GOOD JOB.

998
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:20,652
VERY IMPRESSED.

999
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,029
>> START GRABBING THE STICKS.

1000
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,865
ROB'S FIRE IS BIG, BUT HE'S NOT
BURNING THROUGH THE ROPE YET, SO

1001
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:28,869
WE CAN'T GIVE UP.

1002
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:29,786
>> CAN'T PANIC.

1003
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:30,370
>> DON'T PANIC.

1004
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:33,040
GET MORE HUSK IN THERE.

1005
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,208
KEEP GOING, DON'T GIVE UP.

1006
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:41,256
THIS IS IT.

1007
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,257
ROB'S GOT IT.

1008
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:49,056
ROB'S GOT IT.

1009
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,140
>> THAT'S A LESSON LEARNED THE
HARD WAY.

1010
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,893
>> YEAH, IT IS.

1011
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,896
>> WHAT WERE YOU THINKING GOING
AGAINST ME?

1012
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,731
I'VE MADE HUNDREDS OF FIRES.

1013
00:46:57,814 --> 00:46:59,107
"SURVIVOR" IS FULL OF PITFALLS
LIKE THIS.

1014
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:04,071
SOMETIMES IF THE DEAL IS TOO
GOOD TO BE TRUE, IT PROBABLY IS.

1015
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,698
SO UNFORTUNATELY TONIGHT YOU
HAVE NO VOTE GOING INTO TRIBAL

1016
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,076
COUNCIL.

1017
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,954
BUT HERE'S THE GOOD THING, YOU
KNOW HOW TO MAKE FIRE NOW.

1018
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:14,081
YOU GO BACK THE CAMP, YOU
LEARNED A SKILL.

1019
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:17,251
BUT DON'T FORGET THE OTHER
LESSON, ALWAYS TRUST YOUR GUT.

1020
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:21,630
YOU SHOULD HAVE NEVER BATTLED ME
IN THIS.

1021
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:24,258
>> IT WAS DEFINITELY A RISKY
MOVE FOR ELIZABETH TO TRY TO

1022
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:28,929
MAKE FIRE UP AGAINST BOSTON ROB,
AND IN THE FUTURE, SHE CAN'T

1023
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,265
JUST AUTOMATICALLY JUMP AT
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

1024
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:34,268
OR SHE'S GOING TO BE IN BIG
TROUBLE.

1025
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:37,187
>> BEFORE YOU GO, THERE IS ONE
MORE THING.

1026
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:41,984
WE WANT YOU THE CHOOSE THE NEXT
PERSON FROM THE OTHER TRIBE TO

1027
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:44,444
VISIT THE ISLAND OF THE IDOLS.

1028
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,947
PUT YOUR HAND IN HERE, DON'T
LOOK, AND CHOOSE A NAME AND GIVE

1029
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:51,577
IT TO ME.

1030
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,119
OKAY.

1031
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:52,953
YOU DON'T GET TO SEE.

1032
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,163
COME ON, LET'S GET YOU BACK THE
CAMP.

1033
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:59,251
>> THANK YOU, GUYS.

1034
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:03,130
I AM LEAVING THE ISLAND OF THE
IDOLS WITH SOME WISDOM FROM TWO

1035
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,882
OF THE BEST PEOPLE TO PLAY THE
GAME.

1036
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:09,303
I'M MORE NERVOUS GOING BACK TO
THE I'LL BECAUSE I LOST MY VOTE.

1037
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,429
>> REMEMBER.

1038
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:13,640
TRUST YOUR GUT.

1039
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:14,266
>> THANK YOU, ROB.

1040
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:16,810
I MADE A FOOLISH MISTAKE.

1041
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:23,775
HOPEFULLY IT DOESN'T DESTROY MY
GAME TONIGHT.

1042
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,277
>> I'M NOT VERY CONFIDENT.

1043
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,195
>> WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

1044
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,406
>> BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING AFTER
US.

1045
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,825
>> IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

1046
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:34,119
LISTEN, WE STAY TOGETHER.

1047
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:45,839
YOU'RE CONFIDENT IN IN MISSY,
YEAH?

1048
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:47,132
>> I AM, MISSY, VINCE.

1049
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,342
>> THEY DON'T HAVE NUMBERS.

1050
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:52,512
I THINK THE KEY IS THEY THINK
THEY'VE GOT NUMBERS, BUT WE'VE

1051
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:53,639
GOT NUMBERS.

1052
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:56,183
>> LISTEN, IF I CAN MAKE IT
THROUGH TONIGHT, I'LL WORRY

1053
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:59,186
ABOUT THAT
>> YOU ARE, YOU ARE, I PROMISE.

1054
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,521
>> OH, YEAH, I'M NERVOUS.

1055
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:05,525
IT'S PISSING ME OFF THAT I'M
EVEN ON THEIR RADAR TO BEGIN.

1056
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,236
WITH I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M BEING
THROWN OUT THERE.

1057
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,863
>> NOT THAT I DON'T LIKE HER.

1058
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:15,202
I LIKE HER THAT MUCH TO KNOW SHE
CAN IMMEDIATELY WITHIN PEOPLE

1059
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:15,827
OVER.

1060
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,037
WE'RE PLAYING A GAME HERE.

1061
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,038
>> WHAT ARE YOU FEELING?

1062
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,082
>> I'M FEELING LIKE I'M IN
TROUBLE.

1063
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:20,749
I'M FREAKING OUT.

1064
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:22,793
THAT'S WHAT I'M FEELING LIKE.

1065
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,878
I'LL DO WHATEVER ANYBODY WANTS
ME TO DO.

1066
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:26,546
I JUST DON'T WANT IT TO BE ME.

1067
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,591
THAT'S ALL I'M HEARING IS
BASICALLY ME.

1068
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,386
>> YOUR NAME HAS BEEN THROWN OUT
THERE.

1069
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:33,595
>> BUT THE MAJORITY IS MINE.

1070
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,764
>> IS THERE A DIRECTION YOU
WOULDN'T VOTE IN

1071
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:36,098
>> THAT YOU WOULDN'T VOTE?

1072
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:38,725
>> NO.

1073
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,268
I'D VOTE ANYBODY.

1074
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,896
LISTEN, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
MY NAME IS BEING THROWN OUT

1075
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:44,022
THERE ANYWAY.

1076
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:47,442
>> YOUR NAME IS COMING UP
BECAUSE THE LEVEL OF CONCERN,

1077
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:52,739
HOW AWESOME OR LIKE THE PERSON
YOU ARE.

1078
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,741
THAT'S LIKE YOU BOND WITH
EVERYBODY IMMEDIATELY.

1079
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:55,992
>> YEAH.

1080
00:49:56,076 --> 00:50:01,915
>> AND WHERE ARE YOU AT WITH THE
TRIBE, IN THE SWAP, ARE WE IN

1081
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:02,332
THIS?

1082
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,208
>> I'M IN THIS.

1083
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,210
>> OUR SQUAD, ARE WE IN THIS?

1084
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:09,798
>> THE RELATIONSHIPS, THAT'S
REAL, THAT'S ME.

1085
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:11,091
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

1086
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:14,928
I CAME INTO THIS, I DON'T KNOW
HOW NOT TO BE ME.

1087
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:16,138
AARON SAID PEOPLE LOVE ME.

1088
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,389
I'M TOO NICE.

1089
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:20,308
HE WAS THROWING EVERY COMPLIMENT
HE COULD THINK OF AT ME, SO I

1090
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:24,104
GUESS I FELT BETTER, BUT IT'S
COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDABLE, YOU

1091
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:27,649
KNOW, LIKE I WOULDN'T WANT TO
SIT NEXT TO SOMEBODY LIKE ME IN

1092
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:31,403
THE END, BUT THESE PEOPLE HAVE
THE REALIZE, THEY HAVE TO MAKE

1093
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:32,529
IT TO THE END.

1094
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:37,242
>> SO IF VINCE'S NAME IS THROWN
OUT, YOU'D BE ALL RIGHT?

1095
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:41,246
>> I'D WILL ALL RIGHT WITH
ANYBODY THAT'S NOT ME.

1096
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:41,872
LET'S MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

1097
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:42,539
>> LET'S GO VINCE.

1098
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,332
I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU ALL WANT.

1099
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:44,916
>> OKAY.

1100
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,126
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.

1101
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,210
>> ALL RIGHT.

1102
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:50,464
>> I LOOKED ELAINE DEAD IN THE
EYES AND SAID IT ONE YOU

1103
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:53,425
TONIGHT, IT'S GOING TO BE VINCE,
BUT THAT DECISION HASN'T BEEN

1104
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:54,009
MADE YET.

1105
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:58,472
IS IT VINCE, IS IT ELAINE?

1106
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:01,641
>> COMING BACK THE CAMP I WAS
CONTEMPLATING THE WHOLE TIME IN

1107
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,895
MY HEAD WHAT AM I GOING TO TELL
MY TRIBE MATES.

1108
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:05,729
>> WELCOME BACK.

1109
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:06,938
>> I'VE MISSED YOU.

1110
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:07,773
>> I MISSED YOU GUYS.

1111
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:11,109
>> I DON'T WANT TO SEEM
UNTRUSTWORTHY.

1112
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:14,112
AN I DON'T WANT THE LIE, BUT
SANDRA AND BOSTON ROB TOLD ME TO

1113
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,322
TRUST MY GUT.

1114
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,282
IT'S TELLING ME, I'M GOING TO
HAVE TO, BECAUSE KNOWLEDGE IS

1115
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:18,492
POWER IN THIS GAME.

1116
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,285
>> DOESN'T EVERYONE WANT THE
HEAR ABOUT ISLAND OF THE IDOLS.

1117
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:21,953
NOW IS YOUR CHANCE.

1118
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:22,829
>> IT'S UP TO YOU.

1119
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,998
DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO
>> I'LL TALK.

1120
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:28,710
>> I HATE LYING, BUT TODAY IS
GOING TO HAVE TO BE MY FIRST BIG

1121
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:29,795
LIE.

1122
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:34,341
>> SO YOU GO TO ANOTHER ISLAND,
ISLAND OF THE IDOLS.

1123
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:39,054
THERE'S A PATH, AND IT BRINGS
YOU TO THE THREE URNS, AND IT'S

1124
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,680
LIKE, THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO
PLAY.

1125
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,307
AND YOU HAVE ONE CHANCE TO HIT
AN URN.

1126
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:46,645
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE URNS,
BUT APPARENTLY ONLY ONE HAS

1127
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:47,896
SOMETHING IN IT.

1128
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:52,067
AND I SMASHED THE URN, AND I GET
A LITTLE CARD, AND IT SAYS, YOU

1129
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,027
LOSE, NO GAME.

1130
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,446
SO HERE I AM.

1131
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,739
HOW WAS THE MORALE AFTER?

1132
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,741
>> WE DIDN'T TALK THE EACH OTHER
AT ALL?

1133
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:00,700
>> REALLY?

1134
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:01,576
>> SILENCE.

1135
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,830
>> WELL, I WOULD LIKE TO STILL
BE IN IT.

1136
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,373
I'LL CHAT WITH EVERYBODY.

1137
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:09,209
I AM<i> THE</i> MOST POPULAR GIRL AT
CAMP.

1138
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:12,379
EVERYBODY WANTED TO TALK TO ME
BECAUSE THEY NEEDED MY VOTE.

1139
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:15,423
>> ELAINE GOT TOSSED OUT.

1140
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,384
VINCE WAS OUT THERE.

1141
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:21,263
BUT EVERYBODY WAS KIND OF
GRAVITATING TOWARD ELAINE.

1142
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:22,472
>> OKAY.

1143
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:26,726
>> BUT BETWEEN YOU AND I, I WAS
HOPING THAT'S THE WAY WE GO.

1144
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,564
>> AARON IS TELLING ME WE'RE
GOING TO VOTE OUT VINCE, BUT

1145
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:35,402
AARON WANTS ELAINE.

1146
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:36,361
OTHER PEOPLE WANT RONNIE.

1147
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:38,238
>> WHO ARE YOU VOTING FOR?

1148
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,073
>> I HAVE NO IDEA.

1149
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:41,408
>> I DON'T HAVE A VOTE.

1150
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:44,119
I WANT TO TELL THE PEOPLE THAT
I'M CLOSE WORK BUT YOU DON'T

1151
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:46,037
TELL THEM A THING.

1152
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:49,249
>> WHERE ARE YOU?

1153
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,793
>> I WANT TO GET TO THE END.

1154
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:56,089
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S GOING TO TAKE
ME LYING.

1155
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:59,384
I HAVE THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO
WHERE I DON'T HAVE A VOICE IN

1156
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:00,635
TONIGHT'S VOTE.

1157
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:03,138
AND NOW I HAVE NINE OTHER PEOPLE
COMING UP TO ME TELLING ME NINE

1158
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:06,391
DIFFERENT STORIES, BUT I HAVE TO
KEEP STRAIGHT IN MY MIND.

1159
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:07,392
MY BRAIN IS FRIED.

1160
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:09,811
MY BRAIN IS SCRAMBLED EGGS AT
THIS POINT.

1161
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:12,439
AND THE SUN IS GOING DOWN AND
I'M HEADED INTO TROUBLE COUNCIL

1162
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:13,440
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN TONIGHT.

1163
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:16,318
I HONESTLY HAVE NO IDEA.

1164
00:53:59,235 --> 00:53:59,861
>> Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU A
TORCH.

1165
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:00,445
GO AHEAD AND GRAB ONE.

1166
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:11,247
DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.

1167
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:21,049
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL, BECAUSE IN THIS

1168
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:23,343
GAME, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

1169
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:24,552
WHEN YOU FLAME IS GONE, SO ARE
YOU.

1170
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:31,226
YOU GUYS KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE
THE CASE FOR SOMEBODY TONIGHT.

1171
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:33,687
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FIRST
FEW DAYS.

1172
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,523
CHELSEA, WHEN YOU SHOW UP ON THE
BEACH AND THERE IS NO

1173
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:40,485
INFORMATION, HOW MUCH DOES THAT
AMP UP THE INITIAL PARANOIA?

1174
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:42,779
>> WE WALK OUT TO THE BEACH.

1175
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:45,031
WE WERE ALL JUST LIKE, WHERE'S
JEFF?

1176
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,367
WHERE'S OUR MAROONING?

1177
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:50,704
THEN WE SEE THING FROM,
"SURVIVOR: ISLAND OF THE IDOLS."

1178
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:53,707
IT WAS JUST LIKE, WHAT IS THIS?

1179
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:57,168
>> Jeff: ELAINE, WHAT DID YOU
NOTICE IN TERMS OF PEOPLE

1180
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,378
CONNECTING OR SAYING, HEY, I
HAVE THAT IN COMMON?

1181
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:02,757
>> WELL, I KIND OF GET ALONG
WITH EVERYBODY JUST NATURALLY,

1182
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,385
SO I KIND OF JUST CLICKED WITH
EVERYBODY INSTANTLY.

1183
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:10,515
BUT BECAUSE APPARENTLY THESE
PEOPLE SAY I'M SO WONDERFUL, MY

1184
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:11,641
NAME HAS BEEN THROWN AROUND.

1185
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:14,561
SO I'M PROBABLY GOING HOME
TONIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1186
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:16,604
IT'S GOT ME ON PINS AND NEEDLES.

1187
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:17,772
I'M FREAKING OUT.

1188
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:21,234
>> Jeff: KARISHMA, IS THERE
ANY TRUTH THAT ELAINE MIGHT BE

1189
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:22,902
IN TROUBLE BECAUSE SHE'S
ACTUALLY SO LIKABLE?

1190
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:26,072
>> THERE IS'S DEFINITELY TRUTH
TO THAT.

1191
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,032
>> REALLY?

1192
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,158
>> TOLL YOU.

1193
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:32,412
>> IN THE GAME OF "SURVIVOR,"
LIKABILITY IS A LIABILITY.

1194
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:35,206
I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT.

1195
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:38,376
THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT KEEPING
SOMEBODY ON YOUR TRIBE WHO MAY

1196
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,586
BE LIKED MORE THAN YOU ARE.

1197
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:44,215
>> BUT LISTEN, WHY DO THAT THREE
DAYS IN?

1198
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,550
YOU KNOW, LIKE GIVE ME A CHANCE.

1199
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:49,471
LIKE, OKAY, I'M TOO LIKABLE TO
TAKE TO FINAL TWO OR FINAL

1200
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:52,432
THREE, WHATEVER YOU GOT SET UP
AT THE END, BECAUSE WE KNOW YOU

1201
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,601
CHANGE IT UP.

1202
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:57,437
WHY BREAK ME DOWN BECAUSE I'M
GOOD PEOPLE?

1203
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,480
CUT ME AT 20 DAYS.

1204
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:02,484
TAKE A PIN, PUT IT UP HERE, COME
BACK TO IT LATER.

1205
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,277
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT IDEA?

1206
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,613
>> Jeff: RONNIE, WHAT'S YOUR
YOU TIERA THREE DAYS IN, FIRST

1207
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:07,822
VOTE?

1208
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:11,910
>> FOR ME, YOU KNOW, I THINK WE
NEED TO KEEP THE TRIBE STRONG.

1209
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:15,663
GET RID OF A BIG GUY IN THE
GROUP WOULD BE A MISTAKE.

1210
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,499
IT'S VERY EARLY IN THIS GAME.

1211
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:20,627
IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT STRENGTH,
WE'RE NOT GOING TO WIN THE NEXT

1212
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,419
CHALLENGE.

1213
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,796
WE'LL BE BACK HERE IN THREE
DAYS.

1214
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,631
WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT.

1215
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,175
>> Jeff: SO ELAINE, WE'RE
CLOSE TO VOTING.

1216
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:29,844
IS THERE PART OF YOU THAT'S SAD
THAT YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE OVER,

1217
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:33,765
OR IS IT YOUR ATTITUDE, IF IT'S
OVER, IT'S OVER, THAT'S WAY IT

1218
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:34,307
GOES.

1219
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,476
>> NO, I'M DEVASTATED.

1220
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:43,525
YEAH, I'M DEVASTATED.

1221
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:45,652
EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS WHAT IT
TAKES TO GET HERE.

1222
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:48,696
AND SOME OF US GOT LONGER
JOURNEYS.

1223
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:53,326
SOME OF US GOT A LITTLE MORE
PAIN WE CARRY, AND WHEN YOU

1224
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:57,205
FINALLY GET TO DO SOMETHING THAT
YOU'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT FOR

1225
00:56:57,288 --> 00:57:04,504
SO LONG, LIKE IT'S HEARTBREAK
THANK YOU CAN'T FULFILL WHAT YOU

1226
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,172
HAD SET IN YOUR HEART.

1227
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,383
LIKE THE ENTIRE JOURNEY.

1228
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:09,634
I WANTED TO FILL MY CUP UP.

1229
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:14,681
I WANTED THE SHOW TO BUILD ME
UP, I DIDN'T WANT IT TO TEAR ME

1230
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:15,849
DOWN.

1231
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:19,352
AND IF I GO HOME TONIGHT, IT'S
GOING TO BE HEARTBREAK, BUT AT

1232
00:57:19,435 --> 00:57:21,813
THE SAME TIME, IT'S THE BEST
THING IN THE WORLD THAT'S

1233
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:24,691
HAPPENED TO ME.

1234
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:29,821
>> Jeff: RONNIE, WHEN YOU HEAR
THAT EMOTION, THAT HONEST,

1235
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:33,199
CANDID CONFESSIONAL, WHAT'S THE
REACTION INSIDE YOU?

1236
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:38,371
>> IT MEANS A LOT TO ME, EVEN
THOUGH IT COMES FROM DIFFERENT

1237
00:57:38,454 --> 00:57:39,664
PLACE.

1238
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:44,878
I'M FROM SOUTH BOSTON, BROCKIAN,
MASSACHUSETTS AND SHE'S FROM

1239
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:45,753
KENTUCKY, WE'VE LIVED SIMILAR
LIVES.

1240
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:48,214
>> Jeff: IN TERMS OF HARDSHIP?

1241
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,424
>> IN TERMS OF THE HARDSHIP.

1242
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:53,178
I'VE WORKED AT McDONALD'S, A
LAY-AWAY MANAGER AT WAL-MART, AT

1243
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:59,392
SEARS AUTOMOTIVE AS A CUSTOMER
SERVICE ADVISER, I BAR TEBDZED,

1244
00:57:59,475 --> 00:58:03,855
I HELPED MY FRIEND WITH HIS
PROTEIN BAR COMPANY, I TRIED THE

1245
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:04,856
DABBLE IN THE STOCK MARKET.

1246
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:08,902
I'VE DEALT WITH CRYPTO, I'M
DEALT CASINO GAMES.

1247
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,404
I'M ATTEMPTED TO KICK OFF FROM
THAILAND A COUPLE TIMES.

1248
00:58:11,487 --> 00:58:14,574
WE ALL HAVE OUR STORIES, BUT
THERE'S IN COMPARISON.

1249
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:15,909
THIS GAME IS ON TOP FOR ME.

1250
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,785
THIS IS A DREAM COME TRUE FOR
ALL OF US HERE.

1251
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,037
THAT'S WHY I FEEL HER.

1252
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:22,707
TO GET VOTED OUT IN THREE DAYS,
THAT'S A HEARTBREAKER FOR ANY

1253
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:25,376
ONE OF US OUT HERE.

1254
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:28,588
>> IT'S IS HARD BECAUSE EVERYONE
HERE HAS A STORY, AND I THINK

1255
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,423
THAT'S WHAT'S SO DIFFICULT ABOUT
THIS.

1256
00:58:30,506 --> 00:58:35,637
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT MY JOB WOULD
BE CHOP DOWN COCONUTS AND DO ALL

1257
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,888
THIS STUFF.

1258
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:41,309
NOW THAT I'M HERE, I'M REALIZING
THAT, I DON'T KNOW, IT'S JUST

1259
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:52,737
LIKE, I HAVE PUT IN SO MUCH TOO.

1260
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:57,659
IT'S JUST... IT MAKES ME UNSURE
WHERE I AM DEFINITELY.

1261
00:58:57,742 --> 00:59:01,120
BUT IN TERMS OF GAME PLAY, IT'S
JUST SOMETHING YOU HAVE THE DEAL

1262
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,330
WITH.

1263
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:04,791
OF COURSE SOMEONE LIKE ELAINE
YOU WANT TO SUPPORT, BUT AT THE

1264
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:13,299
SAME TIME, YOU KNOW THAT THAT
MIGHT JUST RUIN YOUR GAME.

1265
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,135
>> Jeff: SO AARON, WHERE DOES
THIS SIT WITH YOU?

1266
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,804
BECAUSE EMOTIONS CAN TOUCH YOU,
BUT DOES IT CHANGE YOUR

1267
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,304
STRATEGY?

1268
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,265
>> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

1269
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:21,849
I MEAN, YES THIS IS A GAME.

1270
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:25,270
SOMEBODY HAS TO GO HOME, BUT
THESE ARE ALL PEOPLE WITH REAL

1271
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,646
FEELINGS AND REAL EMOTIONS.

1272
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:30,817
SO TO GO UP THERE AND WRITE NAME
ON THE PARCHMENT OF SOMEONE THAT

1273
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:34,696
YOU GENUINELY DO CARE ABOUT,
IT'S NOT EASY.

1274
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:42,161
>> IS THIS HARD FOR YOU?

1275
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:49,711
>> Jeff: IT'S BEEN A VERY
EMOTIONAL FIRST TRIBAL COUNCIL?

1276
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:59,345
VINCE, YOU'RE UP.

IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

1282
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:57,779
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1283
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:58,738
ALL RIGHT.

1284
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:05,787
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

RONNIE.

RONNIE.

01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:21,761
WE'RE TIED.

1291
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:28,101
TWO VOTES RONNIE, TWO VOTES
VINCE.

1292
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:28,726
RONNIE.

1293
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:33,940
THAT'S THREE VOTES RONNIE.

1294
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:40,238
THAT'S FOUR VOTES RONNIE, TWO
VOTES VINCE.

1295
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:40,822
RONNIE.

1296
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:49,122
THAT'S FIVE VOTES RONNIE.

1297
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,666
FIRST PERSON VOTED OUT, RONNIE.

1298
01:01:51,749 --> 01:02:05,972
THAT'S SIX, THAT'S ENOUGH, YOU
NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1299
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:10,351
RONNIE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1300
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:11,269
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1301
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:13,354
>> OKAY, GUYS.

1302
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:19,026
GOOD LUCK.

1303
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,988
>> WOW.

1304
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:25,575
>> Jeff: WELL, THE THEME OF
TONIGHT'S TRIBAL WAS HOW

1305
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:27,952
DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE TO VOTE
SOMEBODY OUT, AND YET THE RESULT

1306
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:32,123
A DEVASTATING BLINDSIDE.

1307
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:33,708
YOU'LL HEAD BACK TO CAMP WITH
FLINT.

1308
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:34,667
GOOD LUCK MAKING FIRE.

1309
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:36,002
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

1310
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:41,841
GOOD NIGHT.

1311
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:59,692
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," WHEN THERE'S A BLIND

1312
01:02:59,775 --> 01:03:00,902
SIDE --
>> I DON'T WANT THE TALK TO

1313
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:01,861
ANYBODY RIGHT NOW.

1314
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,779
>> FOOL ME TWICE, THAT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN.

1315
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:06,240
>> Jeff: AND HEART ATTACK, YOU
CAN GO INSANE.

1316
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:10,661
>> PEOPLE CAN'T JUST CREEP
AROUND.

1317
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:11,746
>> LET'S JUST CHILL.

1318
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:14,665
>> I'M GOING CRAZY RIGHT NOW.

1319
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:15,917
>> I WAS BLIND SIDED PRETTY
HARD.

1320
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,044
I DID NOT EXPECT THAT.

1321
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:20,004
I THOUGHT I WAS CONDITION
TRIBUTEING TO MY TRIBE.

1322
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:20,963
IT SUCKS.

1323
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:25,551
IT'S PRETTY EMBARRASSING TO BE
VOTED OUT FIRST.

1324
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:29,096
BUT I MADE SOME MISTAKES, AND IN
THE GAME OF POKER, YOU HAVE TO

1325
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,348
LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES.

1326
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:31,891
IT WASN'T ABOUT JUST THE MONEY.

1327
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:34,560
$1 MILLION IS GREAT, BUT YOU
CAN'T PUT A PRICE ON AN

1328
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,646
EXPERIENCE LIKE THIS.
