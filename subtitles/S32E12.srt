2
00:00:02,963 --> 00:00:05,281
Previously on Survivor...

3
00:00:06,198 --> 00:00:08,384
Everything seemed to be going well 
for Tai.

4
00:00:08,724 --> 00:00:10,103
I have power now.

5
00:00:10,228 --> 00:00:11,345
He had an idol

6
00:00:12,344 --> 00:00:13,688
an advantage in the game...

7
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:15,678
"You have won 
an extra vote."

8
00:00:15,803 --> 00:00:17,193
...and a covenant of five.

9
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:18,319
It's Julia.

10
00:00:18,847 --> 00:00:22,832
But Jason and Julia saw 
that Tai was the most dangerous.

11
00:00:22,957 --> 00:00:24,925
It's stupid not to eliminate Tai.

12
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,971
They tried to convince 
Cydney and Michele to release Tai...

13
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:31,098
Getting rid of Tai is crucial.

14
00:00:31,223 --> 00:00:33,874
...which left 
Cydney and Michele with a heavy decision.

15
00:00:33,999 --> 00:00:35,845
It's good for us to have the choice.

16
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,680
Exit the most dangerous

17
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:40,307
or eliminate one of Michele's closest 
allies.

18
00:00:42,002 --> 00:00:43,052
At the council,

19
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:45,786
Jason pleaded 
for Tai's elimination.

20
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:47,481
I trusted my allies

21
00:00:47,606 --> 00:00:49,859
and Tai flipped 
over more times than a pancake.

22
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:52,483
He's done it twice already!

23
00:00:52,608 --> 00:00:55,189
What makes you think 
there won't be a 3rd time around?

24
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:58,446
But Michele and Cydney 
stayed with the majority

25
00:00:58,571 --> 00:01:00,448
and sent Julia to the jury...

26
00:01:00,573 --> 00:01:02,271
Julia, the tribe has spoken.

27
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,611
...Jason must now 
fend for himself.

28
00:01:07,965 --> 00:01:09,265
There are six left.

29
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,190
Who will be eliminated tonight?

30
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:36,289
You are incredibly persuasive.

31
00:01:36,414 --> 00:01:37,665
I was afraid.

32
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:40,077
I almost played my idol.

33
00:01:40,562 --> 00:01:43,471
I leaned over to her, 
I said, "What should I do?"

34
00:01:43,826 --> 00:01:45,076
It scared me.

35
00:01:45,426 --> 00:01:47,507
The board was a bit hot.

36
00:01:47,632 --> 00:01:49,952
People know now 
that I can preach.

37
00:01:50,296 --> 00:01:51,546
I can speak.

38
00:01:51,671 --> 00:01:53,610
I do it every day 
in my job.

39
00:01:53,735 --> 00:01:56,025
I would convince a mother 
to report her child to me.

40
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,608
We all got there.

41
00:01:57,733 --> 00:01:59,548
- We made it. 
- We made it.

42
00:01:59,673 --> 00:02:00,674
More than six.

43
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,857
You have to seize the opportunities 
that present themselves.

44
00:02:02,982 --> 00:02:04,792
It's time 
to make changes.

45
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,186
Tai will be tough to beat.

46
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:14,040
And Aubry will be tough to beat.

47
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,146
Having me on your side 
wouldn't be bad for you.

48
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:19,450
I have no allegiance to anyone.

49
00:02:19,575 --> 00:02:22,525
But it's better to have me, 
me, in the final trio

50
00:02:23,262 --> 00:02:24,478
rather than one of them.

51
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:27,006
It's time 
to set up a scheme,

52
00:02:27,131 --> 00:02:29,529
to play for oneself, 
to go all the way.

53
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:33,095
Jason frankly went there 
with Cyd and me.

54
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,422
And it would be smart 
to go all the way with him.

55
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,934
But I don't want 
to doubt my allies.

56
00:02:39,184 --> 00:02:41,262
That's why I voted Julia,

57
00:02:41,387 --> 00:02:44,436
'Cause there's no better way 
to show my loyalty

58
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:47,641
than to eliminate my main ally.

59
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:55,740
If the three of us stick together...

60
00:02:55,865 --> 00:02:56,981
We will stay united.

61
00:02:57,106 --> 00:02:59,706
Everyone knows now 
that we stay united.

62
00:03:00,104 --> 00:03:01,515
I have an extra vote.

63
00:03:04,197 --> 00:03:06,810
We will use it next time. 
And we will have four votes.

64
00:03:06,935 --> 00:03:09,832
Suddenly 
Tai reveals that he has an advantage,

65
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:12,768
an extra vote, 
and an immunity idol.

66
00:03:13,187 --> 00:03:15,671
And next, 
I'll use my idol.

67
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,786
- We're quiet. 
- We're not moving from here.

68
00:03:17,911 --> 00:03:19,783
We stay at least 
until the last square.

69
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,228
It's a little scary.

70
00:03:21,353 --> 00:03:24,013
Tai has so many levels of control

71
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:25,981
and I must stay by his side.

72
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:28,136
They don't know 
about the extra vote.

73
00:03:28,681 --> 00:03:30,756
Only the three of us know.

74
00:03:31,028 --> 00:03:34,390
For now, my alliance 
is Aubry and Joe.

75
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:36,826
It's already a close-knit group of three.

76
00:03:37,076 --> 00:03:39,293
And Cydney is number four.

77
00:03:39,418 --> 00:03:41,530
Which leaves Michele and Jason.

78
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,644
If we stay true 
to each other,

79
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:46,502
nobody can do anything.

80
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,996
So on the next vote, 
it's either Jason,

81
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:50,122
that is...

82
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:53,047
He may be 
less dangerous than Michele.

83
00:03:53,511 --> 00:03:56,511
Michele is a 
more complete player.

84
00:03:56,758 --> 00:03:57,760
So...

85
00:03:58,033 --> 00:04:01,050
I have an extra vote 
for one of them.

86
00:04:43,142 --> 00:04:45,528
Come see this crazy thing!

87
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:46,654
What's this ?

88
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:48,333
It's a big larva.

89
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,633
We may have to eat it 
in a trial.

90
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:51,992
Tai, would you eat it?

91
00:04:55,354 --> 00:04:56,374
It's a larva.

92
00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:58,222
I dug and saw this larva.

93
00:04:58,347 --> 00:05:00,643
She is big. 
A little gross.

94
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:04,538
I said, 
"Maybe Mark will like it."

95
00:05:06,782 --> 00:05:07,883
Let's see.

96
00:05:09,535 --> 00:05:11,242
- Oh my God ! 
- Here he goes!

97
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:13,517
Yeah, he wanted her, that's for sure!

98
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:15,654
Oh, my God, look at the chicken!

99
00:05:16,063 --> 00:05:17,418
Wow, that's brutal!

100
00:05:17,543 --> 00:05:19,564
- Oh my God ! 
- He swallowed it!

101
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:21,121
Swallowed whole!

102
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:25,626
Like: "It's mine, 
nobody eats it!"

103
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:27,036
He ate it all.

104
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:28,636
It was funny.

105
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:31,741
I gave up eating that chicken 
days ago.

106
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:34,290
Everyone loves that chicken jerk.

107
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:38,260
Mark is sure to see the 39th day, 
for now.

108
00:05:38,385 --> 00:05:40,053
Watch out, Tai, here come the chickens!

109
00:05:40,178 --> 00:05:41,809
They will steal your feathers!

110
00:05:44,126 --> 00:05:47,002
I am clearly 
between a rock and a hard place.

111
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:48,256
I'm frustrated.

112
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,038
They don't let me play

113
00:05:50,163 --> 00:05:52,228
nobody wants to 
discuss strategy with me,

114
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:54,163
their course is fixed,

115
00:05:54,413 --> 00:05:56,413
it's like talking to walls.

116
00:05:56,782 --> 00:05:58,732
What do you do ? You are thinking ?

117
00:05:59,078 --> 00:06:00,481
I'm hanging out with Mark.

118
00:06:01,088 --> 00:06:02,138
I see it.

119
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,973
What are you thinking about ?

120
00:06:04,223 --> 00:06:07,590
We're spoiling the concept of the game 
at this point.

121
00:06:07,886 --> 00:06:09,425
Just hanging out?

122
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,581
No, by not playing anymore.

123
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:14,773
It's time to act, 
but no one is playing anymore,

124
00:06:14,898 --> 00:06:17,001
everyone accepted their position.

125
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,320
It's frustrating.

126
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:19,966
It pisses me off.

127
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:24,593
Jason has little respect 
for what goes wrong with him.

128
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,420
And here I am

129
00:06:26,545 --> 00:06:28,898
away, and I still want to play.

130
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:31,300
I always imagine 
some very crazy shots,

131
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:34,570
and everyone goes, 
"Huh! I don't really want to."

132
00:06:35,047 --> 00:06:37,731
When it doesn't go his way, 
he's vulgar

133
00:06:38,157 --> 00:06:39,739
and tries to force it.

134
00:06:39,864 --> 00:06:41,402
But people are not fooled.

135
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:43,475
And if I should be excluded,

136
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,132
reduced to just watching, 
with no choice,

137
00:06:46,257 --> 00:06:47,983
then I won't help anymore.

138
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:50,802
At this point, 
I only have one card to play,

139
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:52,192
the "feigning" card.

140
00:06:52,317 --> 00:06:54,148
I do nothing 
and I eat their food.

141
00:06:54,273 --> 00:06:56,829
I don't help with wood 
or anything.

142
00:06:56,954 --> 00:06:58,819
Why help 
those who want me dead?

143
00:06:58,944 --> 00:07:00,644
That's how it is, so...

144
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:03,132
Doing that makes them think:

145
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,210
"He won't get any votes.

146
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,260
Let's keep it."

147
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,072
- I don't know what else to say. 
- Let's stay there.

148
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:11,198
Yeah.

149
00:07:23,102 --> 00:07:24,754
Over here, everyone!

150
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:36,824
Ready for 
today's reward event?

151
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,868
Today,

152
00:07:38,993 --> 00:07:41,262
you will be divided 
into two teams of three.

153
00:07:41,387 --> 00:07:42,563
At my signal,

154
00:07:42,688 --> 00:07:45,380
one by one you will overcome 
a series of obstacles

155
00:07:45,505 --> 00:07:47,535
up to a floating maze.

156
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,526
When you three are there,

157
00:07:49,651 --> 00:07:53,856
you will collaborate 
to evolve three balls there.

158
00:07:55,594 --> 00:07:57,153
The first team to finish

159
00:07:59,924 --> 00:08:01,424
win the reward.

160
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:03,509
- Do you want to know what's at stake? 
- Yeah !

161
00:08:03,634 --> 00:08:05,701
This reward is quite intense.

162
00:08:05,826 --> 00:08:08,898
You will go to a place called 
The wildlife alliance.

163
00:08:09,148 --> 00:08:11,233
It is an organization, 
here in Cambodia,

164
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:14,070
who saves animals from poachers

165
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,617
and traffickers

166
00:08:15,742 --> 00:08:19,341
and brings them to this refuge 
so that they may have a better life.

167
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:20,868
Great.

168
00:08:20,993 --> 00:08:22,818
You can visit 
their facilities

169
00:08:22,943 --> 00:08:24,417
and interact with animals.

170
00:08:24,818 --> 00:08:27,183
You will also be entitled 
to an afternoon picnic.

171
00:08:28,138 --> 00:08:29,853
- Is it worth it ? 
- Yes !

172
00:08:29,978 --> 00:08:32,479
I know it well. We draw 
the teams and we start.

173
00:08:36,438 --> 00:08:38,494
We have our two teams.

174
00:08:41,194 --> 00:08:44,489
face Tai, Michele and Jason.

175
00:08:44,614 --> 00:08:47,069
For the reward, here we go. 
Survivors, ready?

176
00:08:51,348 --> 00:08:52,867
Jason goes first.

177
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,734
Joe goes first.

178
00:09:00,013 --> 00:09:02,518
Jason quickly jumps 
over these obstacles,

179
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:05,458
leaving Joe 
at the first platform.

180
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,665
You have to go all the way 
before the next one can go.

181
00:09:12,473 --> 00:09:14,455
Joe is still progressing 
for the Yellows.

182
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,333
It takes him a while, but he's going.

183
00:09:19,931 --> 00:09:20,995
Go, the Blues!

184
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,662
Michele is in the water 
for the Blues.

185
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:26,275
Joe is still progressing 
for the Yellows.

186
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:29,125
Michele is at obstacles 
for the Blues.

187
00:09:30,763 --> 00:09:32,759
Joe se his se.

188
00:09:32,884 --> 00:09:35,317
His body is tired, 
but he hasn't given up.

189
00:09:38,034 --> 00:09:39,524
Michele arrived.

190
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:40,681
Go, the Blues!

191
00:09:41,084 --> 00:09:42,883
Tai is in the water for the Blues.

192
00:09:43,184 --> 00:09:45,321
Joe crawls to his mat.

193
00:09:46,845 --> 00:09:47,988
Go, the Yellows!

194
00:09:48,585 --> 00:09:50,617
Cydney is in the water 
for the Yellows.

195
00:09:50,742 --> 00:09:52,843
Cydney needs to buy some time.

196
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:55,068
The Blues have a big lead.

197
00:09:57,798 --> 00:10:00,834
Tai will take the first ball 
for the Blues.

198
00:10:05,643 --> 00:10:07,629
Tai has the first ball 
for the Blues.

199
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:09,666
Aubry is in the water for the Yellows.

200
00:10:12,283 --> 00:10:13,823
Alright, you can start.

201
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:15,612
The Blues have their first ball.

202
00:10:15,737 --> 00:10:17,534
Now we need to work together

203
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,709
to move this ball 
through the maze.

204
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,200
Aubry takes the first ball 
for the Yellows.

205
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:27,294
- Quick ! Over there ! On each side ! 
- Big lead for the Blues.

206
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:29,739
Come left!

207
00:10:29,864 --> 00:10:31,265
It's teamwork.

208
00:10:31,748 --> 00:10:33,107
Go in this direction!

209
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,658
The Yellows have their first ball, 
they can start.

210
00:10:36,528 --> 00:10:38,714
- You! This way ! 
- Tai, Michele, Jason.

211
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:40,663
Lots of communication

212
00:10:40,788 --> 00:10:43,091
to understand 
how the balance is made,

213
00:10:43,216 --> 00:10:45,045
how this labyrinth rocks.

214
00:10:45,366 --> 00:10:48,791
Aubry, Cydney, Joe, 
back in the running.

215
00:10:50,075 --> 00:10:52,575
Jason, Tai, and Michele 
are making progress.

216
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,997
They are at the center of the maze 
now.

217
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:56,323
We have to take him there.

218
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,641
Jason directs perfectly.

219
00:10:59,218 --> 00:11:01,693
It's one thing to move 
to get the ball moving.

220
00:11:01,818 --> 00:11:04,899
It must be controlled 
so that it crosses the passages.

221
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,610
This way. 
A little more, girls.

222
00:11:08,727 --> 00:11:10,377
Nice work by the Blues.

223
00:11:10,638 --> 00:11:13,382
They approach the center 
with their ball.

224
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:14,508
This way !

225
00:11:14,964 --> 00:11:19,221
Joe, Aubry and Cydney 
make little progress.

226
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:23,105
You have to come here, 
she has to lean on this side.

227
00:11:23,523 --> 00:11:24,652
You don't listen.

228
00:11:24,777 --> 00:11:27,530
Now you have to put it 
in a hole.

229
00:11:28,847 --> 00:11:31,434
The Blues place one! 
Go get the second one!

230
00:11:33,201 --> 00:11:34,703
They lead 1 - 0.

231
00:11:35,203 --> 00:11:37,673
Jason detaches the second ball 
for the Blues.

232
00:11:38,194 --> 00:11:41,744
Joe, Aubry and Cydney 
are still at the same point.

233
00:11:42,427 --> 00:11:44,205
Jason has the 2nd ball, 
he's back.

234
00:11:46,891 --> 00:11:49,841
Cydney, Aubry and Joe 
are making progress now.

235
00:11:50,302 --> 00:11:52,608
Jason, Michele and Tai 
took the hit.

236
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:54,510
They collaborate very well.

237
00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:56,217
Huge in-game reward.

238
00:11:56,342 --> 00:11:58,096
Come on !

239
00:11:58,711 --> 00:11:59,712
Separate!

240
00:11:59,837 --> 00:12:02,737
Jason, very confident, 
fully in control.

241
00:12:03,968 --> 00:12:06,756
Michele, Jason and Tai are nearby

242
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:09,269
to bring this 2nd ball to the center.

243
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,575
They go, will it work?

244
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,711
Yes, they are in the center and that's it! 
Two for the Blues!

245
00:12:16,155 --> 00:12:19,181
Jason will look for the 3rd 
and last ball for the Blues.

246
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,134
Come to me, come to me!

247
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,987
finally brought 
their first ball to the center.

248
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:26,680
You have to put it in a hole.

249
00:12:26,805 --> 00:12:28,591
So ! Go, Aubry!

250
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:30,893
On the way to the second ball 
for the Yellows.

251
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:34,296
Michele, Jason and Tai 
are on the 3rd and final ball

252
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,371
while Aubry releases the 2nd.

253
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:40,794
Go left!

254
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,338
Left, left!

255
00:12:42,588 --> 00:12:44,788
The Yellows are on their 2nd ball.

256
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:47,935
They will have to act fast 
and rely on luck,

257
00:12:48,238 --> 00:12:51,854
because Tai, Michele and Jason 
understood this ordeal.

258
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:55,151
They approach the center, 
Jason tries to get her in.

259
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:58,721
- Come on, jump! 
- Can he reach the 3rd hole?

260
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:02,565
She's in!

261
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,161
Tai, Michele and Jason

262
00:13:05,286 --> 00:13:06,565
win the reward!

263
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,830
We needed it.

264
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,032
A visit to The wildlife alliance

265
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:12,157
and an afternoon picnic.

266
00:13:12,282 --> 00:13:13,561
It'll be nice !

267
00:13:15,065 --> 00:13:16,376
Stupid ball!

268
00:13:17,056 --> 00:13:20,215
Good. Michele, Tai, Jason, 
great job.

269
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:22,468
Return to shore, 
take your things,

270
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,131
have a good afternoon.

271
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,753
Joe, Aubry, Cydney, 
I got nothing for you.

272
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:33,537
Get back to shore, get your things, 
go back to camp.

273
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:38,043
It's very exciting 
to have this award,

274
00:13:38,168 --> 00:13:39,995
and I love animals

275
00:13:40,876 --> 00:13:43,419
but I'm worried, I'm too scared

276
00:13:43,544 --> 00:13:46,644
that in my absence, 
the team collapses on the camp.

277
00:14:00,926 --> 00:14:03,091
Valiant effort, ladies.

278
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:05,210
We tried.

279
00:14:05,335 --> 00:14:07,866
Now, let's see if we can... 
If there's anything left.

280
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:09,530
Oh, I see a little smoke.

281
00:14:09,655 --> 00:14:10,805
Do you see an ember?

282
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,803
No, but I hope there is.

283
00:14:12,928 --> 00:14:16,163
We lost the event, 
Aubry, me and Cydney.

284
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,567
When you've finished the mangoes, 
take your time,

285
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:21,097
but we need wood, 
because it's ok...

286
00:14:21,388 --> 00:14:24,505
Do you want us to take care 
of the food or the wood?

287
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,728
Let's start with the wood, 
make a nice fire,

288
00:14:26,853 --> 00:14:29,043
then we can go and leave him.

289
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,745
My performance 
was worthy of an infant.

290
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,682
I'm ashamed, but hey, what can I do?

291
00:14:35,827 --> 00:14:37,718
Cyd, go get 
more wood, honey!

292
00:14:40,372 --> 00:14:42,670
A few more bites and I'll be there.

293
00:14:45,422 --> 00:14:47,386
I'm laid down, I'm 
trying to make "a meal",

294
00:14:48,081 --> 00:14:51,068
namely to 
swallow five pieces of coconut,

295
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:55,603
and apparently, it took too long, 
I had to move

296
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,438
and bring wood.

297
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,663
I did...

298
00:14:59,937 --> 00:15:03,514
No no no ! Are you having problems, are 
you tired? I do not care.

299
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:04,937
Keep that for you.

300
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:08,048
I hate being told 
what to do when I eat.

301
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,311
I won't take this 
all day.

302
00:15:10,436 --> 00:15:12,737
There's little chance. 
I won't last.

303
00:15:12,862 --> 00:15:14,762
I have trouble with orders.

304
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:17,520
It was demonstrated 
throughout the game,

305
00:15:17,645 --> 00:15:20,227
that's how it goes 
with the Muscles tribe.

306
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:21,829
It should take a while.

307
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,798
I don't think I've received 
so many orders in my entire life.

308
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:26,692
I don't know if Joe understands it,

309
00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:30,638
but fire does not need 
great flames to last.

310
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,632
We are in the middle of Kaôh Rông, 
we don't need more heat!

311
00:15:33,942 --> 00:15:35,734
It's starting to boil.

312
00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:37,166
Tell me if I can help.

313
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,182
- There, put that under. 
- I'm trying to help.

314
00:15:39,307 --> 00:15:41,142
On this side of the fire.

315
00:15:44,201 --> 00:15:45,202
This side ?

316
00:15:45,327 --> 00:15:47,601
No no. Slide this under 
while I lift.

317
00:15:47,726 --> 00:15:49,924
- Slip what? 
- Yes, right there, below!

318
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,585
Sorry, just to be sure.

319
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,575
Yes, there is nothing else.

320
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,720
Yeah, that's it.

321
00:15:54,845 --> 00:15:56,753
It's been a long day 
for all of us.

322
00:15:57,319 --> 00:15:59,466
I don't know 
what Joe's problem is.

323
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,994
He wants to burn everything here, 
I don't know.

324
00:16:02,304 --> 00:16:03,542
And it's hard too

325
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:06,188
'cause Cydney doesn't like 
being bullied

326
00:16:06,313 --> 00:16:07,772
and tell him what to do.

327
00:16:07,897 --> 00:16:11,687
And above all, she must not 
blow up everything,

328
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:13,862
because then we'd be screwed.

329
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,306
Oh my God !

330
00:16:26,176 --> 00:16:27,376
Oh my God !

331
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:28,654
It's a feast!

332
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,432
Oh my God !

333
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:32,707
Look at this !

334
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,716
Jason, Tai and I 
went to the shelter

335
00:16:36,841 --> 00:16:39,031
and this beautiful picnic 
was prepared.

336
00:16:39,353 --> 00:16:40,683
It was paradise.

337
00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:41,900
Too good.

338
00:16:42,483 --> 00:16:44,249
I'm not supposed to 
eat meat,

339
00:16:44,374 --> 00:16:46,380
but I'm here and I'm too hungry.

340
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,801
Cheers ! Cheer !

341
00:16:47,926 --> 00:16:50,075
- We made sure. 
- To teamwork!

342
00:16:51,191 --> 00:16:52,641
It's an elephant!

343
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:55,281
But he's coming this way!

344
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,475
Oh my God !

345
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,850
He is huge !

346
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,863
We were in this beautiful hut,

347
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,524
we were having a great time 
and we see this elephant coming.

348
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,334
Oh my God !

349
00:17:08,572 --> 00:17:09,672
Who is this ?

350
00:17:09,797 --> 00:17:10,963
I am Nick.

351
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:12,755
- Hello ! 
- And she's Lucky.

352
00:17:14,006 --> 00:17:17,278
Nick, director 
of Wildlife Alliance,

353
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,961
brought this elephant, Lucky.

354
00:17:20,312 --> 00:17:21,957
She is 16 years old

355
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,461
and she was wonderful.

356
00:17:23,586 --> 00:17:24,977
How did you get it?

357
00:17:25,102 --> 00:17:27,288
She was found alone, 
in Kaoh Kong,

358
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,391
the forest in the southwest of the country, 
wandering alone,

359
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:31,666
without his mother.

360
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,888
All our animals 
have been saved from traffickers.

361
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,500
You want some ?

362
00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:41,135
Is it me you want?

363
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,129
Lucky, you are so beautiful!

364
00:17:44,765 --> 00:17:46,707
My daughter is crazy about animals.

365
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,622
She won't believe it.

366
00:17:48,747 --> 00:17:50,544
My daughter, being autistic,

367
00:17:50,794 --> 00:17:54,849
for some reason, 
she has always loved animals.

368
00:17:55,099 --> 00:17:58,464
It's visible, it brings him 
calm and sweetness,

369
00:17:58,589 --> 00:18:00,557
it stimulates her

370
00:18:00,682 --> 00:18:02,848
and makes her feel 
like she's needed.

371
00:18:02,973 --> 00:18:06,327
It was cool to know 
that I was doing something

372
00:18:06,577 --> 00:18:09,563
that my little baby would love so much.

373
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,423
Thanks to you, I am fulfilled, Lucky!

374
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:15,936
She will hallucinate to see 
that Dad hangs out with animals.

375
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,730
Who has a father who does this?

376
00:18:17,976 --> 00:18:19,026
Come quickly.

377
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:21,469
Vites, vites!

378
00:18:24,723 --> 00:18:26,071
Slowly and calmly.

379
00:18:26,487 --> 00:18:27,748
Slowly and calmly.

380
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,609
Speak softly, be calm 
and sit down, don't startle them.

381
00:18:31,661 --> 00:18:32,757
Little monkey !

382
00:18:32,882 --> 00:18:34,890
It was good that Jason was there.

383
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:37,629
He has an autistic daughter

384
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,207
and she'll see 
him hanging out with that monkey,

385
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:42,930
touch an elephant...

386
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,765
A little affection, the monkey!

387
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,761
I appreciate it more and more.

388
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,272
I just want a little affection!

389
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:54,566
Although Jason 
is very persuasive on the board,

390
00:18:56,198 --> 00:18:59,004
Michele has no enemies 
in the jury.

391
00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:02,650
At the moment, I think Michele 
should come out next.

392
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,458
Where did the little baby go?

393
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,883
- He is down there. 
- He's right there.

394
00:19:07,008 --> 00:19:08,009
Health !

395
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:12,494
Jason wants us to see 
him softer than he is.

396
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:16,942
I want to believe he likes animals 
and do this for his kid,

397
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:20,092
but with the story 
of the machete and the ax,

398
00:19:20,217 --> 00:19:23,070
I saw his evil side.

399
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,224
- Hey, don't be silly! 
- Brawler!

400
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:27,624
So if Jason 
doesn't win immunity,

401
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:31,099
the best case scenario for me 
would be to release it now.

402
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,088
Over here, everyone!

403
00:20:00,386 --> 00:20:02,334
Are we attacking 
the immunity test of the day?

404
00:20:02,806 --> 00:20:04,506
First of all, Michelle...

405
00:20:04,772 --> 00:20:06,837
You're not going to help me at all!

406
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:08,440
I'm half way there.

407
00:20:11,551 --> 00:20:14,252
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

408
00:20:14,377 --> 00:20:15,413
Today,

409
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:18,825
you will be holding a rope 
balancing an unstable plateau.

410
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,410
At my signal, you will 
fetch wooden blocks,

411
00:20:21,535 --> 00:20:23,221
bring them back one by one

412
00:20:23,346 --> 00:20:27,067
and stack them on top of each other, 
forming the word "immunity".

413
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:29,624
If your board wobbles,

414
00:20:29,749 --> 00:20:31,779
your stack falls, 
you have to start over.

415
00:20:31,904 --> 00:20:33,740
The first person to finish

416
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,081
gain immunity,

417
00:20:35,206 --> 00:20:39,409
ensures a one in five chance 
of winning this game.

418
00:20:40,061 --> 00:20:42,349
The losers: after 32 days,

419
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:45,986
someone will be eliminated 
and become the 6th member of the jury.

420
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,080
We draw the places at random 
and we start.

421
00:20:54,451 --> 00:20:55,487
Well, on and go.

422
00:20:55,612 --> 00:20:56,663
For immunity

423
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:59,289
and a guaranteed place 
in the final quintet,

424
00:20:59,414 --> 00:21:00,559
Survivors, ready?

425
00:21:06,602 --> 00:21:10,010
There will clearly be 
a learning phase

426
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,545
in this test.

427
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,171
It's a question of balance,

428
00:21:13,462 --> 00:21:14,648
patience

429
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,117
and, when necessary, 
the right amount of speed.

430
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:20,579
You form the word "immunity",

431
00:21:20,704 --> 00:21:23,156
but you have to do it 
one block at a time

432
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:25,143
while keeping 
the blocks balanced

433
00:21:25,268 --> 00:21:26,709
on a very unstable plateau.

434
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:28,520
Joe comes to get his 2nd block.

435
00:21:28,645 --> 00:21:30,679
Joe, 71 years old,

436
00:21:30,804 --> 00:21:34,067
still in play, 
takes the lead in this event.

437
00:21:35,984 --> 00:21:38,148
There were 18 people 
at the start of the game.

438
00:21:38,273 --> 00:21:39,731
There are six left.

439
00:21:39,856 --> 00:21:41,806
Five will still be there tomorrow.

440
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:44,444
Joe places his second block.

441
00:21:46,143 --> 00:21:47,648
Joe plays aggressively.

442
00:21:47,898 --> 00:21:49,783
Michele places her second block.

443
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,311
Tai places his second, he leaves.

444
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,979
Aubry places his second.

445
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,714
Jason places his second.

446
00:21:57,547 --> 00:21:59,671
Cydney is dead last.

447
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,796
She moves like 
she can't walk.

448
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:08,694
Joe places his third block.

449
00:22:09,032 --> 00:22:10,562
Michele is second.

450
00:22:11,241 --> 00:22:13,173
Third block for Tai.

451
00:22:13,423 --> 00:22:15,267
Jason places his third.

452
00:22:15,392 --> 00:22:17,177
Aubry places his third block.

453
00:22:17,427 --> 00:22:19,337
Joe has his fourth block.

454
00:22:19,462 --> 00:22:21,915
Even grabbing hold of the block is difficult,

455
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,785
because you always have to 
maintain the balance.

456
00:22:25,035 --> 00:22:27,256
Joe, back with his 4th block.

457
00:22:27,381 --> 00:22:29,344
Joe is halfway through,

458
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,892
followed by Michele, then Tai.

459
00:22:32,761 --> 00:22:35,272
Everyone else 
is struggling to get back up.

460
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:37,557
Cydney is always dead last.

461
00:22:37,682 --> 00:22:39,385
She returns with her third,

462
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,668
totally out of the way 
at the moment.

463
00:22:43,587 --> 00:22:45,215
This is Joe, with his fifth.

464
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,898
You have to be careful.

465
00:22:47,023 --> 00:22:48,809
The higher the stack,

466
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,734
the more careful you have to be.

467
00:22:53,442 --> 00:22:55,516
Tai nearly loses his stack.

468
00:22:55,985 --> 00:22:57,384
Nice recovery.

469
00:22:57,634 --> 00:23:01,352
Jason, who was on the bottom 
rung, would love to have immunity tonight.

470
00:23:01,477 --> 00:23:04,024
But you have to do it 
one block at a time.

471
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,485
One mistake and the battery drops.

472
00:23:08,366 --> 00:23:10,355
Joe loses everything!

473
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,447
After leading all the way.

474
00:23:12,572 --> 00:23:14,468
Pick them up, bring them back 
and do it again!

475
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,162
Michele is leading now.

476
00:23:16,927 --> 00:23:18,605
Tai is on his heels.

477
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:21,176
Michele loses everything!

478
00:23:21,301 --> 00:23:22,676
Tai leads!

479
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,245
See how quickly 
everything can change!

480
00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:28,682
Aubry loses everything!

481
00:23:28,932 --> 00:23:30,175
It's contagious !

482
00:23:31,461 --> 00:23:33,156
Tai leads now,

483
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:34,863
with Jason on his heels.

484
00:23:34,988 --> 00:23:36,990
Cydney, still out of it.

485
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:40,727
And suddenly,

486
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:41,918
Tai loses everything!

487
00:23:42,043 --> 00:23:43,857
Jason leads now.

488
00:23:43,982 --> 00:23:45,799
Everything changed.

489
00:23:46,171 --> 00:23:48,068
Cydney is now second.

490
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:53,037
Damn, that's the wrong letter! 
It's an "I"!

491
00:23:53,162 --> 00:23:54,568
Joe got the letter wrong!

492
00:23:54,693 --> 00:23:57,248
Not only must they be 
stacked in balance,

493
00:23:57,373 --> 00:24:00,314
but we must also remember 
how to write "immunity"!

494
00:24:01,665 --> 00:24:04,379
Jason, who has a big lead 
over Cydney,

495
00:24:04,504 --> 00:24:06,220
returns with his sixth.

496
00:24:07,617 --> 00:24:08,967
Jason loses everything!

497
00:24:09,263 --> 00:24:11,525
And now Cydney is leading!

498
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,361
Incredible turnaround 
!

499
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,964
Cydney was totally out of it

500
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:19,566
and she is now in the lead.

501
00:24:20,014 --> 00:24:22,394
Say what you want 
about Cydney's method,

502
00:24:22,742 --> 00:24:25,405
but she didn't lose anything 
from the whole ordeal.

503
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,808
Everyone is running after Cydney.

504
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:32,266
Last throughout the race, 
she could now win it.

505
00:24:33,535 --> 00:24:36,035
Taking care of your mount, 
is that the answer?

506
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,143
- Shit ! 
- Joe is doing it again!

507
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:41,255
Cydney extends her lead.

508
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,715
Cydney is at five.

509
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,343
Aubry is on three.

510
00:24:44,468 --> 00:24:45,993
Michele is at three.

511
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:47,141
Tai is at three.

512
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:48,707
Jason is two.

513
00:24:48,832 --> 00:24:52,882
The good news is that Cydney 
continues to evolve very slowly.

514
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,460
In other words, 
it can be caught up.

515
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:59,473
Michele comes back 
to place her fourth.

516
00:25:00,355 --> 00:25:02,442
Aubry has her fifth block.

517
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:05,412
Jason places his third, 
he tries to get back in the race.

518
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,237
He moves faster.

519
00:25:07,362 --> 00:25:09,841
Tai has his fifth block. 
He got back into the race.

520
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:13,387
Whore !

521
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,547
I keep getting it wrong.

522
00:25:15,672 --> 00:25:17,722
Joe brings back the wrong letter!

523
00:25:17,847 --> 00:25:20,360
It's fun, until 
you get to the board.

524
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,960
Aubry returns with his sixth.

525
00:25:24,085 --> 00:25:26,133
She could take the lead.

526
00:25:27,224 --> 00:25:28,702
Michele has her fifth.

527
00:25:29,886 --> 00:25:31,805
Michele loses everything!

528
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:35,409
Tai loses everything! 
He's out of it.

529
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,079
Aubry loses everything!

530
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,629
The only one who rivaled Cydney 
has just lost everything!

531
00:25:41,754 --> 00:25:44,354
Cydney now places 
her sixth block.

532
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:48,013
It's going to be played out between Jason and Cydney.

533
00:25:48,304 --> 00:25:52,313
Can Jason accelerate enough 
to come back up?

534
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,630
Jason returns with his sixth block.

535
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:59,572
Cydney is two blocks 
from certainty,

536
00:25:59,697 --> 00:26:01,197
tonight at the council.

537
00:26:01,985 --> 00:26:05,097
Jason places his sixth block. 
He's only missing two.

538
00:26:05,222 --> 00:26:07,407
Cydney speed up a bit now,

539
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:09,134
she feels pressure from Jason.

540
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:11,496
Cydney places her seventh block.

541
00:26:11,621 --> 00:26:13,413
He's only missing one.

542
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:16,783
Jason returns with his seventh 
while Cydney leaves,

543
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,952
very slowly, 
pick up his eighth.

544
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,617
Jason, on his heels, 
places his seventh.

545
00:26:21,742 --> 00:26:23,649
Jason almost caught up with Cydney.

546
00:26:24,054 --> 00:26:26,593
Cydney is moving very slowly.

547
00:26:26,949 --> 00:26:28,729
Jason, extremely aggressive.

548
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:32,061
It's neck and neck 
between Cydney and Jason.

549
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:34,267
Cydney reaches for her 8th block,

550
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:35,690
she can't find it.

551
00:26:35,815 --> 00:26:37,896
You can't take your 
eyes off the board!

552
00:26:39,189 --> 00:26:40,709
Jason has his eighth block.

553
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:42,000
Jason takes the lead.

554
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:44,344
New change 
at the head of the race.

555
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:46,313
It's between Jason and Cydney,

556
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,335
who both return 
with their 8th and final boulder.

557
00:26:50,138 --> 00:26:53,086
Cydney tries to pick up the pace.

558
00:26:53,336 --> 00:26:55,522
Jason places his eighth block.

559
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:56,648
He's going back.

560
00:26:56,773 --> 00:26:58,959
Cydney places her eighth block.

561
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,085
She leaves.

562
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,595
It's gonna be racing

563
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,189
to get back to the start 
without dropping everything.

564
00:27:04,314 --> 00:27:06,114
It could all be there.

565
00:27:07,856 --> 00:27:10,170
Jason always has a 
few centimeters...

566
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,905
And Jason loses everything!

567
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:16,268
Cydney is 
just a few steps away from immunity.

568
00:27:18,389 --> 00:27:20,105
Cydney put one foot down.

569
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:22,473
And two!

570
00:27:22,598 --> 00:27:25,261
Cydney wins 
individual immunity!

571
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:28,539
She secures a place 
in the final quintet.

572
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,433
Oh my God !

573
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:32,559
It was crazy !

574
00:27:34,064 --> 00:27:35,514
Cydney, come here!

575
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,290
- Good game. 
- Thanks.

576
00:27:39,415 --> 00:27:41,501
You are safe, 
you will not be eliminated.

577
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,554
A guaranteed place 
in the final quintet.

578
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:44,840
Advice tonight.

579
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:48,509
Someone will be eliminated 
and become the 6th member of the jury.

580
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:50,718
It won't be you.

581
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:52,204
Congratulation.

582
00:27:52,329 --> 00:27:54,539
Take your things, 
return to camp. Good job.

583
00:28:16,085 --> 00:28:18,671
- My favorite event so far. 
- Me too.

584
00:28:18,796 --> 00:28:20,040
Yeah, that was good.

585
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,699
Just you against the block.

586
00:28:25,285 --> 00:28:26,790
For tonight's advice,

587
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:29,386
I decided that Michele 
was the most dangerous,

588
00:28:29,511 --> 00:28:30,776
in front of Jason.

589
00:28:31,136 --> 00:28:33,344
I will therefore try 
to convince the group

590
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:35,178
to vote Michele.

591
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,190
Hold on. Joe, sit down.

592
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:48,571
Michele is not here yet. 
Let's talk.

593
00:28:48,696 --> 00:28:50,203
For me, it's Michele.

594
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:55,379
I would not prefer.

595
00:28:55,504 --> 00:28:57,853
It's up to you. 
But I'd rather take Jason out.

596
00:28:57,978 --> 00:29:00,071
It's up to you.

597
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:03,374
I say: Michele.

598
00:29:04,648 --> 00:29:05,792
Here it is.

599
00:29:07,067 --> 00:29:08,580
So, sirens?

600
00:29:09,795 --> 00:29:11,297
Unfortunately,

601
00:29:11,422 --> 00:29:13,852
Michele joined us, 
the four of us,

602
00:29:13,977 --> 00:29:16,227
and the group has not decided yet,

603
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,323
but it will probably be Michele.

604
00:29:18,802 --> 00:29:20,959
We remain five welded.

605
00:29:21,477 --> 00:29:23,161
Jason gave up.

606
00:29:23,286 --> 00:29:26,318
- It's pretty obvious, isn't it? 
- It's very obvious.

607
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:31,503
No need 
to take the lead this time.

608
00:29:31,628 --> 00:29:34,005
Michele thinks 
Jason is next.

609
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:37,240
But tonight I'll use 
my extra vote

610
00:29:37,365 --> 00:29:38,895
to vote Michele.

611
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,892
So we might have, 
I don't know,

612
00:29:41,017 --> 00:29:43,223
four or five votes,

613
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,258
and we'll see what happens.

614
00:29:45,508 --> 00:29:47,248
Please I think...

615
00:29:48,214 --> 00:29:50,588
- ...that she's more dangerous. 
- Oh, I'm with you.

616
00:29:56,893 --> 00:29:59,064
I vote for Michele.

617
00:29:59,189 --> 00:30:00,612
Are you voting for Michele?

618
00:30:00,737 --> 00:30:02,595
Yeah. 
I want you to vote Michele.

619
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,101
I push in this direction.

620
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:06,184
But we haven't decided.

621
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:08,367
But I will talk to them.

622
00:30:09,105 --> 00:30:10,942
Tai's like, "Vote Michele!"

623
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:13,310
But I can't trust Tai.

624
00:30:13,435 --> 00:30:15,483
He's already betrayed me once.

625
00:30:15,608 --> 00:30:17,422
I want to vote for Joe.

626
00:30:17,547 --> 00:30:19,284
So I don't know what I'm going to do.

627
00:30:19,409 --> 00:30:21,323
At this point, I improvise.

628
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,044
How do you feel ?

629
00:30:27,169 --> 00:30:29,364
I would like to take it out. 
I'm sick of his face.

630
00:30:29,489 --> 00:30:30,862
Me too, we agree.

631
00:30:30,987 --> 00:30:34,611
But Tai has his own plans, 
his reasons for voting Michele.

632
00:30:34,736 --> 00:30:37,259
Jason should have been out 
a long time ago,

633
00:30:37,384 --> 00:30:40,980
so i hope i 
can convince people

634
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:43,546
that Jason has to get out before Michele.

635
00:30:43,671 --> 00:30:45,343
I will do what others want.

636
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:48,037
I'm not going to oppose 
the majority, it's not worth it.

637
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:50,843
Tai wants to impose his choices.

638
00:30:50,968 --> 00:30:52,366
And I say, "No.

639
00:30:52,491 --> 00:30:54,923
You try to impose your choices 
through intimidation."

640
00:30:55,048 --> 00:30:56,598
Joe feels intimidated.

641
00:30:56,723 --> 00:30:59,022
It makes me suspicious.

642
00:30:59,147 --> 00:31:00,992
I don't like it too much.

643
00:31:05,381 --> 00:31:07,651
Tai is thoroughly anti-Michele.

644
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,168
He's pushing 
for us all to be anti-you.

645
00:31:10,489 --> 00:31:12,785
So Aubry is coming after me 
now?

646
00:31:13,296 --> 00:31:14,879
It's Tai.

647
00:31:16,837 --> 00:31:19,287
He tries to push us 
in this direction.

648
00:31:19,547 --> 00:31:22,767
To my surprise, 
Tai has me in the crosshairs

649
00:31:22,892 --> 00:31:25,291
and explains to them 
that he wants me out.

650
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:28,341
I will do my best 
to make them let go of you,

651
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,115
I'll do everything I can, 
but know that I've got you covered

652
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,033
as much as I can.

653
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:36,805
But I was tight, time wise,

654
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,773
to talk to people 
I haven't talked to.

655
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,543
So tonight, at the council, 
I'll try to limit the damage,

656
00:31:43,793 --> 00:31:45,737
hoping Jason leaves

657
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,014
and that I'm still here tomorrow.

658
00:31:48,264 --> 00:31:49,753
Ce foutu Tai !

659
00:31:54,018 --> 00:31:55,602
I have a concern.

660
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,327
my concern,

661
00:31:58,452 --> 00:32:02,754
it's that once again, 
someone is imposing their choices on us.

662
00:32:04,175 --> 00:32:06,090
And Tai pushes hard.

663
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,473
Absolutely not.

664
00:32:07,598 --> 00:32:09,312
I have already experienced this.

665
00:32:09,437 --> 00:32:11,224
You won't decide who I vote for.

666
00:32:11,349 --> 00:32:13,531
Tai has more or less decided 
that we will take out Michele.

667
00:32:13,656 --> 00:32:15,771
And actually, I agree.

668
00:32:15,896 --> 00:32:17,351
Michele didn't upset anyone,

669
00:32:17,476 --> 00:32:19,237
everyone 
gets on well with her.

670
00:32:19,362 --> 00:32:22,632
But I have known 
more democratic decisions.

671
00:32:24,911 --> 00:32:26,987
And Cydney thinks it's a mistake

672
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,456
and she refuses 
to be told what to do.

673
00:32:29,706 --> 00:32:32,592
For me, personally, 
we are not going to control my game.

674
00:32:34,861 --> 00:32:37,245
But Tai 
is in my core alliance.

675
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:39,532
So it's a tricky position.

676
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:41,326
I'm in a funny situation.

677
00:32:41,451 --> 00:32:44,023
- I hope you'll respect that... 
- Yes.

678
00:32:44,148 --> 00:32:46,464
...That I have another opinion 
on that one.

679
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,923
If you had to choose

680
00:32:48,048 --> 00:32:50,176
between voting with me 
or voting with them?

681
00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:55,581
I am mentally exhausted.

682
00:32:55,706 --> 00:32:57,356
This time around, it's rough.

683
00:32:59,205 --> 00:33:01,255
It's like Sophie's Choice.

684
00:33:02,483 --> 00:33:04,911
I have no idea 
who I'm going to vote for tonight.

685
00:33:05,036 --> 00:33:06,793
I will decide at the time.

686
00:33:07,227 --> 00:33:09,070
The council is likely to be hectic

687
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,931
and it could well 
be my doing too.

688
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:32,210
Now here are the members of the jury.

689
00:33:40,577 --> 00:33:43,229
and Julia, 
eliminated at the last council.

690
00:33:46,282 --> 00:33:48,134
Let's talk about today's test.

691
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:51,697
I don't remember seeing 
so many changes at the front of the race

692
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:53,398
in the same ordeal, never.

693
00:33:53,523 --> 00:33:56,433
Jason, is this a good summary of the game?

694
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:00,020
It's all over the place 
and anything can happen.

695
00:34:00,145 --> 00:34:01,181
In effect.

696
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:04,564
It's unpredictable. Every time 
you think it's good,

697
00:34:05,368 --> 00:34:06,411
it escapes you.

698
00:34:06,724 --> 00:34:09,717
Everyone here almost won,

699
00:34:09,842 --> 00:34:12,092
but the blocks remained 
in place only for her.

700
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:16,474
With that around your neck, 
in addition to security,

701
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:20,464
immunity can give you 
a little more influence.

702
00:34:20,589 --> 00:34:22,193
Did you feel it today?

703
00:34:22,318 --> 00:34:24,738
For me, everyone played their game.

704
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:27,866
But some were 
more sure of themselves than others,

705
00:34:27,991 --> 00:34:31,236
seeking to impose their choices

706
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:33,626
or to decide for you.

707
00:34:33,751 --> 00:34:35,682
I can clarify who it is.

708
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,409
We all know it's Tai.

709
00:34:39,142 --> 00:34:42,773
Tai said over and over 
that he has two idols

710
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:44,724
or that he has the super-idol.

711
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,151
The other is an advantage.

712
00:34:46,276 --> 00:34:48,086
Whether he's an idol or not, 
I don't know.

713
00:34:48,614 --> 00:34:50,955
It's up to me to decide whether 
to show it to you or not.

714
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,224
Whether you believe me or not 
is up to you.

715
00:34:53,784 --> 00:34:57,303
Coming back to the discussion, 
I think our alliance came together

716
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,876
and that everyone could speak,

717
00:34:59,001 --> 00:35:00,788
everyone expressed their opinion.

718
00:35:00,913 --> 00:35:02,479
Cydney, why this reaction?

719
00:35:02,604 --> 00:35:04,502
It's Tai's choice or nothing 
at this point.

720
00:35:04,627 --> 00:35:06,413
I had that feeling 
today.

721
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:08,093
We expressed different ideas,

722
00:35:08,218 --> 00:35:10,108
but it fell 
on deaf ears.

723
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:13,478
I wanted to have 
a moment with Cydney, alone.

724
00:35:15,339 --> 00:35:16,523
To talk.

725
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:17,949
We didn't have time.

726
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,985
Aubry, what a face you made!

727
00:35:21,283 --> 00:35:23,454
I thought he could talk

728
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,357
and have a good chat with Cydney.

729
00:35:26,482 --> 00:35:28,993
So you wonder 
why he wanted more time?

730
00:35:29,118 --> 00:35:30,495
Yeah, I guess, a little.

731
00:35:30,844 --> 00:35:33,239
I thought everything was clear

732
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:34,541
for the group.

733
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:38,411
It's telling enough, 
when we are allies

734
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:40,772
and that we all decided 
who we would vote for,

735
00:35:40,897 --> 00:35:43,241
whether you need 
private conversations.

736
00:35:43,366 --> 00:35:44,876
It doesn't make sense to me.

737
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:46,002
But OK.

738
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:48,088
Well, Jeff.

739
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:51,558
There is a large group 
and a smaller group in it.

740
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:54,169
Tai means 
there is a starting order

741
00:35:54,294 --> 00:35:55,687
and I'm down.

742
00:35:55,812 --> 00:35:59,436
So I can't be included, 
because there's a smaller group

743
00:35:59,561 --> 00:36:02,168
and he thinks he can 
impose everything

744
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,104
because he has "two idols".

745
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:08,661
Even if we don't have the same idea 
of ​​what should happen tonight...

746
00:36:08,786 --> 00:36:11,711
I thought we had the same idea!

747
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,704
We were 
on the same wavelength.

748
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:15,785
I think 
our opinions differ, but...

749
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:19,052
And there is a consensus 
on who should leave tonight.

750
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:22,777
But Tai goes beyond 
different opinions.

751
00:36:22,902 --> 00:36:25,517
You said there is a group 
and a smaller group.

752
00:36:25,885 --> 00:36:28,695
Are you aware 
of how Michele may be feeling,

753
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,955
not being 
high enough in the hierarchy

754
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,799
for that level?

755
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:35,560
Yes. In his place, that's exactly 
how I would see him.

756
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,943
So, Michele, you know 
where you fit in this group.

757
00:36:39,068 --> 00:36:41,608
I know where Tai thinks 
I fit in this group,

758
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:44,785
and if that's what my other allies think ,

759
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,389
so it's a pity,

760
00:36:46,514 --> 00:36:50,341
because Tai betrayed 
all the allies he had

761
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:51,943
and I proved my loyalty,

762
00:36:52,068 --> 00:36:53,420
again and again.

763
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,491
Madness is doing 
the same thing over and over again

764
00:36:56,616 --> 00:36:58,283
hoping for a different result.

765
00:36:58,408 --> 00:37:00,945
If they want to be crazy, 
let them follow Tai!

766
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,423
And they will be had.

767
00:37:02,548 --> 00:37:04,831
At the last vote, I did not betray.

768
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:07,300
- A vote where you did not betray! 
- And nobody...

769
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:09,514
And then you try 
to generate more chaos!

770
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:12,215
Honestly, I don't know how 
you failed in this alliance.

771
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:14,883
You weren't there originally.

772
00:37:15,008 --> 00:37:16,801
and I don't know how, 
after the vote...

773
00:37:16,926 --> 00:37:19,345
I was in this alliance 
before you!

774
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,757
We formed 
a brand new alliance,

775
00:37:22,882 --> 00:37:25,780
and I said, "Why do we have 
one more person?"

776
00:37:27,502 --> 00:37:31,558
Wow ! You're downstairs, and besides, 
we don't really want you.

777
00:37:31,808 --> 00:37:32,892
Well...

778
00:37:33,142 --> 00:37:36,062
It's a piece of crap, 
but hey, whatever.

779
00:37:36,762 --> 00:37:39,324
Aubrey. There 's a 
lot going on.

780
00:37:39,665 --> 00:37:43,161
Do you feel like you're 
in chaos?

781
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:47,941
Yeah. Looks like Cydney 
and Michele are suspicious of Tai.

782
00:37:48,191 --> 00:37:50,343
It was discussed a lot,

783
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,628
and if it goes into a spin,

784
00:37:52,753 --> 00:37:54,806
that I can't control 
what Tai says,

785
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:56,708
Tai can assume his words.

786
00:37:56,833 --> 00:38:00,720
My playing style is different 
from Tai's.

787
00:38:02,005 --> 00:38:03,148
Hello, Jeff!

788
00:38:05,441 --> 00:38:08,595
Jason, you seem to 
be on the low end, aloof,

789
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,321
for a while, and yet,

790
00:38:10,446 --> 00:38:13,146
the discussion does not revolve 
around you.

791
00:38:13,766 --> 00:38:15,560
Yes, that's why 
I keep quiet.

792
00:38:15,685 --> 00:38:18,907
When you hear Michele and Tai 
settle their accounts,

793
00:38:19,032 --> 00:38:20,465
does that excite you?

794
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,133
Of course that excites me.

795
00:38:22,614 --> 00:38:26,813
We get here and these cracks 
in the concrete appear.

796
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:29,407
So this may not be 
my last trip here.

797
00:38:29,532 --> 00:38:32,649
Or else I'm leaving anyway tonight,

798
00:38:32,774 --> 00:38:35,188
and then I know who will follow me.

799
00:38:38,201 --> 00:38:40,083
Well, it's time to vote.

800
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:41,584
Jason, over to you.

801
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:01,675
You have to go first.

802
00:39:17,946 --> 00:39:19,352
I will count the votes.

803
00:39:19,477 --> 00:39:20,525
Wait, Jeff.

804
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,130
I want to use my advantage.

805
00:39:31,183 --> 00:39:33,224
Tell us what it is.

806
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:36,016
My advantage, 
I can add another vote

807
00:39:36,141 --> 00:39:37,617
to any advice.

808
00:39:41,104 --> 00:39:43,520
Tai's advantage 
is an extra vote.

809
00:39:43,645 --> 00:39:46,001
It counts 
like any other vote.

810
00:39:46,126 --> 00:39:48,128
Tai, go vote a second time.

811
00:39:57,006 --> 00:39:58,563
It's number 2.

812
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:00,288
You must go.

813
00:40:11,014 --> 00:40:12,744
I will count the votes.

814
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:22,929
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

815
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:25,131
now is the time to do it.

816
00:40:30,424 --> 00:40:33,076
Good. Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

817
00:40:33,201 --> 00:40:35,834
The eliminated person 
will leave the council immediately.

818
00:40:35,959 --> 00:40:37,335
I will read the votes.

819
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:40,772
First vote:

820
00:40:47,702 --> 00:40:48,703
Michele.

821
00:40:51,371 --> 00:40:52,372
Jason.

822
00:40:52,497 --> 00:40:53,985
Tied: two votes Michele,

823
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,353
two votes Jason.

824
00:40:58,199 --> 00:40:59,477
A vote Joe.

825
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:03,917
Jason.

826
00:41:04,042 --> 00:41:05,396
That's three votes Jason,

827
00:41:05,521 --> 00:41:06,763
two votes Michele,

828
00:41:06,888 --> 00:41:07,953
a joe vote,

829
00:41:08,078 --> 00:41:09,475
one vote remains.

830
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:16,930
Eleventh person eliminated 
and sixth member of the jury...

831
00:41:17,055 --> 00:41:19,255
Jason. 
Bring me your torch.

832
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:33,128
Jason, the tribe has spoken.

833
00:41:35,748 --> 00:41:36,995
It's time to go.

834
00:41:45,929 --> 00:41:48,050
It seems that by eliminating Jason,

835
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:51,232
you have eliminated 
the only person still isolated.

836
00:41:51,357 --> 00:41:53,150
Which leaves you five

837
00:41:53,275 --> 00:41:56,322
and not enough room 
for everyone on the raft.

838
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:59,125
Take your torches, 
return to camp. Good night.

Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

842
00:42:13,763 --> 00:42:15,873
Next time in Survivor...

843
00:42:15,998 --> 00:42:17,566
Like I was the easy vote.

844
00:42:17,691 --> 00:42:20,036
Tai's plan to take Michele out 
backfires.

845
00:42:20,161 --> 00:42:22,170
Aubry tricked me.

846
00:42:22,295 --> 00:42:24,473
But an unlikely alliance 
could change everything.

847
00:42:24,598 --> 00:42:26,884
I have an idol. 
Who do we choose?

848
00:42:27,009 --> 00:42:30,254
If he feels betrayed, he could 
take a completely different direction.

849
00:42:31,213 --> 00:42:33,591
Who knew 
Tai and I would collaborate?

850
00:42:33,841 --> 00:42:36,339
I've been watching Survivor for 15 years.

851
00:42:36,464 --> 00:42:38,724
I love the show 
as much as the first day.

852
00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:41,933
I didn't give up, didn't give up, 
even kept away,

853
00:42:42,058 --> 00:42:43,109
alone against all,

854
00:42:43,234 --> 00:42:45,929
I was still trying 
to go back and fight.

855
00:42:46,054 --> 00:42:49,027
I'm proud of how I played, 
proud of my game,

856
00:42:49,152 --> 00:42:51,059
and I think my family 
will be too.

857
00:42:51,184 --> 00:42:52,777
I love you girls.
