>> JEFF: Previously on<i> Survivor:</i>

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,129
Erik was the last man left in

3
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:05,380
the game.

4
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:06,673
And the women's alliance

5
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:08,258
desperately wanted him out.

6
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:09,300
>> It's us and Erik.

7
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,677
>> We need to figure out what we

8
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,428
need to do.

9
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,221
>> JEFF: But when he won the

10
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:14,723
immunity challenge, Erik threw a

11
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:15,265
wrench into their plans.

12
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,600
>> What are we all thinking?

13
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:18,643
>> I couldn't win against

14
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:19,144
Amanda.

15
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:22,731
>> JEFF: So Natalie, Alexis, and

16
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,524
Erik decided to vote out Amanda.

17
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:26,067
>> ♪ Da, da, da, da. ♪

18
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,485
>> JEFF: Cirie was still tight

19
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:28,862
with Amanda and Parvati, but

20
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:29,404
reluctant to force a tie.

21
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:30,196
>> So what do I do, make it a

22
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:37,954
tie?

23
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:40,123
>> You know that I would.

24
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,583
>> JEFF: At tribal council,

25
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,042
Amanda tore into Erik for

26
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,252
turning his back on her.

27
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,295
>> I helped you stay here

28
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,212
through the merge, and then I

29
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,881
was asking for your help, and

30
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,466
you clearly denied me of that.

31
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,759
>> JEFF: Then Amanda pulled off

32
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,010
the biggest blindside yet by

33
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,219
playing the hidden immunity

34
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,679
idol.

35
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,848
>> ♪ But I got it. ♪

36
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:57,932
>> JEFF: The rest of the tribe

37
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:58,975
was stunned as Alexis was sent

38
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:00,143
home.

39
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,102
Alexis, the tribe has spoken.

40
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,228
Only five are left.

41
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,315
Who will be voted out tonight?

42
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,535
>> I didn't have it when I told

43
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:21,206
you guys I didn't have it.

44
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,458
I got it afterwards.

45
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,460
>> Whoo-ee, tribal council, boy,

46
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,670
is getting dangerous, from the

47
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,631
idols floating around and people

48
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,592
using them and not using them.

49
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,052
You want me to make a fire?

50
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,261
>> Can do you it in the dark?

51
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,346
>> I mean, Amanda put me through

52
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,388
the wringer.

53
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,306
She is good, though, because she

54
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,766
had me right at the brink of

55
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,434
being willing to make it a tie

56
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,269
vote.

57
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,395
You know, I guess that's what

58
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,355
she needed to see to know that

59
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,773
she can trust me.

60
00:01:46,856 --> 00:02:02,247
>> It was a pretty wild night.

61
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,207
>> They took out Alexis.

62
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,459
That's... if Parvati and Cirie

63
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,962
are smart, they'll recognize

64
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,630
that Amanda is very popular with

65
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,675
the jury, and they won't take

66
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,385
her.

67
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,261
>> It just doesn't make sense

68
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,680
for anyone to take her to the

69
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:19,848
final three.

70
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:20,390
It doesn't make any sense.

71
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,017
>> Yeah.

72
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,144
I would like to see Amanda

73
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,398
just... outie.

74
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,190
At tribal council, Amanda made

75
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,484
me feel like a fool, and I

76
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,986
definitely am pissed off about

77
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,279
that.

78
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,446
But everything can be switched

79
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,489
up with the hidden immunity

80
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,782
idol.

81
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:38,825
I want us to find the hidden

82
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:39,993
immunity idol.

83
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,161
That's the problem with Exile

84
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,829
Island, though, because if they

85
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,539
win, they can send anybody.

86
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:45,707
And I don't know if they would

87
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,249
send me.

88
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,417
To go to Exile Island at this

89
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,335
point, you have to find that

90
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,962
idol, because it's the last

91
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,297
chance you get to use it.

92
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,423
So whoever gets the idol, that's

93
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,841
pretty much like winning

94
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,426
individual immunity.

95
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,261
And then if I win, like if I

96
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,429
win... I'm going to try and win.

97
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,805
Okay.

98
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,974
Okay.

99
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,309
>> And if I win you want me to

100
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,727
send you?

101
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,312
I mean, that's in our best

102
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,272
interest right now.

103
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,024
>> I think so, yes.

104
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,317
You need to.

105
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,359
Probably... like, I don't want

106
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,361
to go, because it's Exile, but

107
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,488
we have to at this point.

108
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,032
At this point, I'm weighing the

109
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:19,574
pros and cons of different

110
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,242
choices I could make in this

111
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:21,451
game.

112
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,327
I might have to listen to

113
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,203
Natalie and go with Natalie.

114
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,204
But nothing is set in stone

115
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,080
right now.

116
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:26,998
I mean, everything is just...

117
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:27,874
it's still moving, it's still

118
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:28,833
kind of evolving.

119
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,001
So at this point I don't trust

120
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,169
anybody in this game.

121
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:31,711
I really can't 100% trust

122
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,630
anybody.

123
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,965
But I do have to pick sides.

He's going.

130

>> Exactly.

131
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,029
That's what I'm thinking.

132
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,030
I don't really have a question

133
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:41,531
mark about Cirie anymore.

134
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,741
I pretty much tested her trust

135
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:44,993
when... she was pretty much

136
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,411
ready to pick rocks, so I'm not

137
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,912
too worried about Cirie's

138
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,622
loyalty.

139
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,623
You know, I trust my girls

140
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,499
again.

141
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:52,709
I trust Parv and Cirie, and it's

142
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,378
us three to the end.

143
00:04:58,881 --> 00:04:59,757
>> It matters if he wins...

144
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,342
>> I know.

145
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,969
We don't want Erik or Natalie

146
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,388
going to Exile, because if one

147
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,889
of them gets the hidden immunity

148
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,975
idol, it could be the end of the

149
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,768
game for me, Parvati, or Cirie.

150
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,145
>> Erik is whoever gets to him

151
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:12,520
first.

152
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:15,565
It Amanda could get in his head

153
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,442
that she forgives him...

154
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,443
>> Yeah.

155
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,027
>> ...he'll do whatever she

156
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,195
says.

157
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,865
>> You.

158
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:24,449
Mm-hmm.

159
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,576
Yeah, talk to him.

160
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,870
Try to get him...

161
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,586
>> So, what are your thoughts

162
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,837
now about things going on?

163
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,088
>> I'm looking to whatever this

164
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:39,505
reward is.

165
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:44,218
And... I don't know.

166
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:44,844
I feel like I could win it, like

167
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,971
I want to win it, because I am

168
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:47,388
starving.

169
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,389
I feel like it's going to be

170
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:52,393
food.

171
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,895
>> Amanda is a very, very

172
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,480
strategic player.

173
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,148
So I don't know if I can trust

174
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,649
her after she ripped me over the

175
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,068
coals at the last tribal

176
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,277
council.

177
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:01,819
And now she is pushing for

178
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,654
herself to go with me on the

179
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:04,405
reward.

180
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,573
>> I'm not going out of this

181
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:06,532
game without a fight.

182
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,367
>> Right.

183
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,327
>> And I think it's better that

184
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,203
we team up, you being the most

185
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,162
physical player on the team and

186
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:11,788
me the most strategic and battle

187
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,498
against the odds rather than...

188
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,791
>> Than play into what they're

189
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,666
doing.

190
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,793
>> ...possibly lose a challenge

191
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,044
and be out.

192
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,670
>> That's how I do feel.

193
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:20,755
I feel very stressed.

194
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:21,714
>> You think?

195
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,632
Me, too.

196
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,509
>> It's true.

197
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,427
>> Erik's very, very naive, so I

198
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,555
think I can definitely

199
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,474
manipulate his mind into sending

200
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,268
Parvati to Exile.

201
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,353
>> What are your thoughts on

202
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:35,645
Exile today?

203
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,522
Natalie was pushing for me to

204
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,149
possibly go.

205
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:40,691
Like, she wanted me to go.

206
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:41,484
>> Of course she wants you to.

207
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,319
>> And I don't want to go at

208
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,278
all.

209
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:44,862
>> Because she wants you to be

210
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:45,655
weaker for the next challenge.

211
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,614
>> I don't want to go there at

212
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,490
all.

213
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,283
>> You're playing a physical

214
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:49,992
game.

215
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,077
Why would you weaken yourself?

216
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,245
>> That's true.

217
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,871
>> It doesn't make any sense.

218
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:54,831
>> True.

219
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:55,873
>> Why not send Parvati?

220
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:56,958
Parvati is so weak right now,

221
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:57,875
she won't even want to look for

222
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,626
it.

223
00:06:58,709 --> 00:06:59,502
She'll just sit there on the

224
00:06:59,585 --> 00:06:59,752
island.

225
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,504
>> It's really weird, because I

226
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,839
feel like I have some kind of

227
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,632
choice to make on the fact that

228
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:05,800
I'm starting to win some

229
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,135
challenges, and now I feel like

230
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:07,677
it's basically Natalie and

231
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,929
Amanda who are trying to talk me

232
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,223
into some different plan.

233
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:12,765
So it's very... who do you

234
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,600
trust?

235
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,227
Who do you really trust here?

236
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,270
>> You're good at thinking,

237
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,187
Erik.

238
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,980
Like, you're almost there

239
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:19,897
sometimes.

240
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,440
>> Almost there.

241
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,316
I mean, it's not all hair up on

242
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,651
my head.

243
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,740
>> JEFF: Come on in, guys!

244
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,540
>> Sweet.

245
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,041
>> You guys ready to get to your

246
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:39,750
challenge?

247
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:40,001
>> Yeah.

248
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,252
>> Yeah.

249
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,128
>> JEFF: Today's challenge is

250
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:42,753
going to test how well you know

251
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,756
this game you love so well.

252
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,883
For today's challenge, I'm going

253
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,384
to ask you questions about

254
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:49,677
favorite moments from past

255
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,389
seasons of<i> Survivor.</i>

256
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:54,515
Every time you get one right,

257
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,558
you score a point.

258
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,185
First to four wins reward.

259
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,144
Want to know what you're playing

260
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:58,895
for?

261
00:07:58,978 --> 00:07:59,812
>> Yes!

262
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:00,771
>> JEFF: The winner of this

263
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:01,772
challenge will board a

264
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:02,690
helicopter.

265
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,108
You will take a beautiful flight

266
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,443
over the rock islands.

267
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:05,985
You will land at a luxury

268
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,695
resort.

269
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:08,821
>> Oh, my god!

270
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:09,530
>> JEFF: Massage, meal.

271
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,824
>> Meal!

272
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,034
>> JEFF: You'll return to camp

273
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,160
in the morning.

274
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,369
In addition, the winner of the

275
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,455
challenge will send one person

276
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:17,830
to Exile Island.

277
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,291
Because Amanda played the hidden

278
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:20,917
immunity idol at the last tribal

279
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,543
council, there is yet another

280
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,296
hidden immunity idol.

281
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,465
The last time you can use the

282
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,633
hidden immunity idol is the next

283
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,218
tribal council.

284
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,802
That means you have one chance

285
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,471
to find the idol, one time to

286
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:33,721
play it.

287
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:34,639
Big enough stakes?

288
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,474
>> Yeah.

289
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,350
>> JEFF: All right, we'll get

290
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,186
started.

291
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,812
All right, first question.

292
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,273
On which season of<i> Survivor</i> did

293
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,109
a castaway have a pet snake?

294
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:53,574
Everybody locked in?

295
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,743
Cirie makes a last-minute

296
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:56,786
change, and it's a good thing

297
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:57,912
she did.

298
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:58,996
The correct answer is Pearl

299
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,081
Islands.

300
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,415
Cirie gets it right.

301
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,917
Erik gets it right.

302
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,418
Rupert had a pet snake named

303
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,586
Balboa.

304
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,797
One point Cirie, one point Erik.

305
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,383
Next question.

306
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,009
In which season of<i> Survivor</i> did

307
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,594
a shark bite a survivor, and in

308
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,097
retaliation the survivor bit it

309
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,433
back?

310
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,851
If you are a fan of this game,

311
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,562
you should know this.

312
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:27,275
Erik says it was the first

313
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,068
season of<i> Survivor.</i>

314
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:29,610
That is not right.

315
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,988
Parvati and Cirie says Palau.

316
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,447
Palau is wrong.

317
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,407
Natalie and Amanda say<i> Survivor</i>

318
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,325
<i>All-Stars.</i>

319
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,535
All-Stars is right.

320
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,619
Amanda and Natalie both score a

321
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,745
point.

322
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,622
Richard Hatch got bitten by a

323
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,332
shark and he bit it back.

324
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,333
>> His teeth, right there, he's

325
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,461
got me.

326
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,796
>> JEFF: Cirie, Amanda, Natalie,

327
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,755
and Erik all with one.

328
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,966
Playing to four.

329
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,342
Next question:

330
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,094
In which season of<i> Survivor</i> did

331
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,054
a tribemate ask another

332
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,473
tribemate to pee on their hand

333
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,017
after being stung by a sea

334
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,393
urchin?

335
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,312
If you saw the season, you'll

336
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:08,274
remember this moment.

337
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,443
One person got it right.

338
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,694
The correct answer was<i> Survivor:</i>

339
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,530
<i>Marcasis.</i>

340
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:15,072
Erik, the only one to get it

341
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:15,865
right.

342
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,326
John asked Kathy to pee on his

343
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:18,951
hand after being stung by a sea

344
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:19,869
urchin.

345
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:20,703
>> I need somebody who can pee

346
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,746
on my hand.

347
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:27,335
Okay, okay.

348
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,419
>> JEFF: Erik moves into the

349
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,378
lead with two.

350
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,504
Cirie, Amanda, Natalie with one.

351
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,340
Parvati with zero.

352
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,841
Next question.

353
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:34,759
During which season of<i> Survivor</i>

354
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,136
was one of the castaways

355
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,554
evacuated after falling into the

356
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:39,805
fire?

357
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:51,317
Cirie, Parvati, and Erik all say

358
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,818
<i>Survivor: Australia.</i>

359
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:53,903
Erik is nodding, certain he's

360
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,071
right.

361
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,155
The correct answer is<i> Survivor:</i>

362
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,240
<i>Australia.</i>

363
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,034
Michael fell in the fire.

364
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,411
>> You're coming right now.

365
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,288
>> JEFF: That was 2001.

366
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,748
Erik was 14 years old.

367
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,918
Proof of your superfan status.

368
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,753
Erik now in the lead with three,

369
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,713
Cirie with two, Parvati, Amanda,

370
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,424
and Natalie with one.

371
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:15,841
Next question.

372
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,718
Erik, get this one right, you

373
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:22,807
win reward.

374
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,767
During which season of

375
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,435
<i>Survivor</i> did we first divide

376
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,061
the castaways into four separate

377
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:31,941
tribes?

378
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,734
When was the first time we

379
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:34,819
divided the castaways into four

380
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,946
separate tribes?

381
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:45,996
Parvati and Amanda both say the

382
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,997
Cooks.

383
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,457
Both wrong.

384
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,917
Cirie, Natalie, and Erik all

385
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,461
say<i> Exile Island.</i>

386
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,547
For the first time ever, you

387
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,215
have been divided into four

388
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,842
tribes by age and gender.

389
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,052
<i>Exile island</i> is correct.

390
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,971
Erik wins reward.

391
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,974
>><i> Survivor!</i>

392
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,351
>> Spin it, baby.

393
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,352
>> JEFF: Nice job.

394
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,478
>> Thank you.

395
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,062
>> JEFF: Okay, first decision.

396
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,856
Who you sending to Exile Island?

397
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,734
Big strategy at this point.

398
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,778
>> I'm pretty sure that I want

399
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,364
to send Parvati to Exile Island.

400
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,242
>> Bye, guys.

401
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,285
>> JEFF: Parvati, boat's waiting

402
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,870
for you.

403
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,288
All right, Erik, next decision.

404
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,414
You have three people left.

405
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,540
You're going to choose one

406
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,500
person to go with you.

407
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,710
>> Before the challenge, I gave

408
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:33,335
Amanda my word that I would take

409
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,171
her.

410
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,672
And if she won, she had her word

411
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,132
that she would take me.

412
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,467
So I'm going to pick Amanda.

413
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:44,972
>> JEFF: Come on over, Amanda.

414
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:45,890
>> Thank you for keeping your

415
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,017
word.

416
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:49,935
>> JEFF: All right, Cirie,

417
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:50,478
Natalie, grab your stuff.

418
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:50,853
Head back to camp.

419
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,646
I got nothing for you.

420
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:52,980
>> Bye, guys.

421
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:53,856
>> JEFF: Erik, Amanda, nice

422
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,775
reward-- massage, nice meal,

423
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:57,818
good night's sleep.

424
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:58,903
>> Yes!

425
00:12:58,986 --> 00:12:59,195
High five.

426
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,613
>> JEFF: Helicopter's waiting

427
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,363
for you.

428
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,031
Enjoy it.

429
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,908
Head on out.

430
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,002
>> Well, that was a doozy.

431
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,546
>> Mm-hmm.

432
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,048
I'm so upset.

433
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,966
Just stunned.

434
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,260
Like, if Erik seriously wanted

435
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,138
to get Amanda out, it would have

436
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,932
been a sure-fire thing to send

437
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,935
me to Exile, not Parvati.

438
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,603
Had a reward challenge.

439
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:33,979
Erik won.

440
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,190
I was hoping for him to win,

441
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,274
considering the conversation we

442
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,442
had this morning about it.

443
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,110
He said he'd send me to Exile or

444
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,612
take me on the reward.

445
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:42,988
Well, Parvati's on Exile, and he

446
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,282
chooses to take Amanda on the

447
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,577
reward, which adds up not one

448
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:48,953
iota.

449
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:53,624
>> Erik is a little weasel.

450
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:54,250
To me, where do his loyalties

451
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,960
lie if he told you he'd take

452
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,254
you, and he told her he'd take

453
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,256
her, and he took her, but she's

454
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,091
the one he's going to vote out?

455
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,593
I was kind of just yanking

456
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,177
Natalie around a little bit,

457
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,513
which is fun for me because it's

458
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,556
killing her.

459
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,515
She thinks she has Erik in her

460
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,516
pocket.

461
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,309
You do not feed and take care of

462
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,104
the person that you plan on

463
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,605
beating in the next immunity

464
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,147
challenge to make sure that

465
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,983
she's the one he's going to vote

466
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,317
out.

467
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,611
I mean, maybe that's a new

468
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,989
tactic that I don't know about.

469
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,657
>> Yeah.

470
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,950
>> "Let me make you as strong as

471
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,118
possible so I can vote you out."

472
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,162
The only pleasure I'm getting

473
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:32,913
out of today in not going on the

474
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:36,000
reward is seeing Natalie stress

475
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,545
out over Erik taking Amanda and

476
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,339
Parvati being on Exile.

477
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,632
>> Looks like a rat, smells like

478
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:43,966
a rat.

479
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,343
>> Give it cheese.

480
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,095
>> Yeah.

481
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,096
Is that them?

482
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,682
>> Where?

483
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,445
>> Natalie out there?

484
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,279
>> They're waving.

485
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,405
>> Oh, my god!

486
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,824
>> Yeah, they were.

487
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:10,993
>> Oh, look at this view!

488
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:14,872
>> Oh, my god!

489
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,248
>> This is awesome!

490
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,791
Woo!

491
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,961
>> Woo!

492
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,380
>> I'm really glad that you came

493
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,590
with me, that I chose you.

494
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,799
Honestly, I would want a friend

495
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:26,884
on this trip rather than a

496
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:27,843
stranger.

497
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:30,554
>> I feel the same way.

498
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,096
>> I know I didn't do what

499
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,515
Natalie wanted me to do.

500
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,600
If I brought Natalie, there

501
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,851
would be no relaxation, I don't

502
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:37,519
feel, and there was a part of me

503
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,145
that legitimately wanted to

504
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,230
spend time with Amanda and just

505
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:40,981
get to know her more as a friend

506
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,234
again.

507
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,862
>> Oh, my god!

508
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:47,988
>> I want to enjoy this as much

509
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,032
as I can.

510
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,201
And I feel like I'm thinking

511
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,410
about the game way too much,

512
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,953
and, thinking, "Is Amanda

513
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,038
manipulating you, are you

514
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,706
manipulating Amanda, whatever?"

515
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,749
And I don't want to think about

516
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,918
that at all.

517
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:05,714
>> Woo-hoo!

518
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,008
>> Woo!

519
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,136
>> Oh!

520
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,057
>> Oh, my god.

521
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,436
>> This is the best reward ever.

522
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,063
>> Oh, yes.

523
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,107
>> Put them in.

524
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,150
>> Oh, my god.

525
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,610
We're getting foot treatments.

526
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,362
>> Whatever you're doing to the

527
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,239
toes...

528
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,616
I've never been to a spa in my

529
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,701
life.

530
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,576
>> Really?

531
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,577
>> Never been to a spa in my

532
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,538
life.

533
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,586
>> I feel like ever since I got

534
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,170
immunity last time, like, I'm,

535
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,215
like, the center of all that's

536
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,175
going on.

537
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,344
>> Well, you kind of are.

538
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,095
>> People are coming to me to

539
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,264
ask me, "What decision do you

540
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,474
want to make?"

541
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,767
And I'm just like, "I work in an

542
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,893
ice cream parlor.

543
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:00,728
I don't do this.

544
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:01,645
I don't make these decisions

545
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,730
about people."

546
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:03,939
>> Why not?

547
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:04,273
>> I just...

548
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,107
>> It's good to be in a power

549
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,942
position.

550
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:08,026
>> I'm just not used to it.

551
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,319
I'm going to kick myself

552
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,821
probably for whatever choices

553
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:11,363
that I made today, but I'm

554
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,657
trying to go with what I have.

555
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,033
I'm trying to go with what I can

556
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,243
see right now and make the best

557
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,578
decision.

558
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:18,662
I just need to step up, I think.

559
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,748
I mean, that's part of being a

560
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,083
man, being an ice cream man

561
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,627
instead of an ice cream boy.

562
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:40,517
>> I got here to Exile, and it's

563
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,894
gorgeous.

564
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:42,853
It's paradise for me.

565
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,062
This is kind of like my own

566
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,189
little private vacation.

567
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,231
I love it, because I really

568
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,775
needed this time to just chill,

569
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,109
maybe get a little tan, maybe

570
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,195
look for the idol if I want to.

571
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,988
If I don't want to, I don't have

572
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:54,907
to, because the reason for me

573
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,116
being here is just to prevent

574
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,827
Natalie and Erik from getting a

575
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,287
chance at getting the idol.

576
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,413
So it doesn't really matter if I

577
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,623
find the idol or not, because

578
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,083
Cirie, Amanda, and me, we have

579
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,418
the numbers.

580
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,473
>> I hate feeling bitter when

581
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,224
people come back from rewards.

582
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,266
But you just can't help it.

583
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,184
>> I'm not bitter about that.

584
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,603
I'm bitter about... well, we

585
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,312
promised each other if we won

586
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,397
we'd take each other.

587
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,649
What?

588
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,359
>> Where is everybody?

589
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,445
>> I don't know.

590
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,114
>> Probably sleeping.

591
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,156
>> Oh, yeah.

592
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,407
I think that's them.

593
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,161
>> Yeah.

594
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,621
>> Look who's back.

595
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,289
Bitches.

596
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,874
Don't try to look pitiful.

597
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:46,375
I know it was absolutely

598
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,334
wonderful.

599
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,795
I won that same challenge in my

600
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,088
season.

601
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,172
So I don't want to hear that it

602
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,382
wasn't fun and y'all didn't wake

603
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,843
up at 3:00 AM and eat more food.

604
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:56,426
>> We actually didn't eat more

605
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,178
food.

606
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,388
>> You should have.

607
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,389
That's what we did.

608
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,850
>> They had just dinner.

609
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:03,433
Like, you pick from the list.

610
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,309
>> We had, like, a waitress.

611
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,185
>> I wish we all could have

612
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,396
gone.

613
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,196
>> Returning to camp was very

614
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,490
bad.

615
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,533
I come back to camp, and Natalie

616
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,576
didn't even look at me.

617
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,577
She doesn't even talk to me.

618
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,911
It's no longer sunshine and

619
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:23,370
happiness.

620
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,706
I mean, she obviously had

621
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,708
resentment.

622
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,928
I know Nat is pissed off at me

623
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,763
for a lot of reasons.

624
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:42,973
>> Yeah.

625
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:43,724
I guess she thinks you should

626
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:44,349
have taken her, but she did...

627
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:44,766
see, I don't know.

628
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,184
Because she did say she wanted

629
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:46,560
to go to Exile.

630
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:49,104
>> Mm-hmm.

631
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:50,230
>> And I guess she feels like if

632
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,607
you were going to vote Amanda

633
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,150
out, how would you take her on a

634
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,860
reward?

635
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:55,944
>> I feel regardless of what

636
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:56,945
happens right now, I'm going to

637
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,405
piss somebody off.

638
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,073
>> See, that's the thing.

639
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,450
>> I'm either going to piss off

640
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,576
Nat or piss off Amanda right now

641
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,452
for sure.

642
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,036
>> Do you think if Natalie was

643
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,203
sitting next to you she would

644
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:05,996
beat you hands down, or you

645
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:06,747
think if Amanda was sitting next

646
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,456
to you she'd beat you hands

647
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,248
down?

648
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,207
>> That's what I have to think

649
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:09,958
about.

650
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:10,959
>> That's the question.

651
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:11,835
>> I feel like me, you, and

652
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:12,836
Parvati are still on the fence,

653
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,921
because we don't know which one

654
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,213
is most likely to win all the

655
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,382
votes.

656
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,008
We think that both of them have

657
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,217
a really good chance.

658
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,052
So maybe me, you, and Parv

659
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:20,928
should go to the end and do that

660
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,095
instead.

661
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,347
>> That would mean we would get

662
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,058
rid of who?

663
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,309
>> Either Nat or Amanda.

664
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,228
>> God, this idiot.

665
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,438
I literally walked right in

666
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,732
front of Erik and heard his

667
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,817
entire conversation with Cirie

668
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,945
about how Natalie and Amanda are

669
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,572
the biggest jury vote threats.

670
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,740
Everybody's going to vote for

671
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:42,908
them on the jury so they can't

672
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,618
go to the final three.

673
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,619
You know what?

674
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,912
I could have literally bitch-

675
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,121
slapped him, smack him like his

676
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,666
mother.

677
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,884
>> What just happened just now?

678
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:01,802
>> I just overheard a complete

679
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:02,761
conversation.

680
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,597
>> He just told me that it would

681
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,473
probably be beneficial for me,

682
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:09,142
him, and Parv to go to the end.

683
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:09,601
>> I'm not surprised.

684
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,895
Am I surprised?

685
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:16,149
No, I know this is him.

686
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,569
See, the problem with Erik's

687
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,321
strategy is that there's five

688
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,783
people left, and four of them

689
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,410
are women.

690
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,452
And when you go to each woman

691
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,454
and you tell her something

692
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,747
different, pretty soon the women

693
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,207
are going to talk.

694
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:38,296
>> Idiot.

695
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:38,922
>> I might have screwed up quite

696
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,049
a bit.

697
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:41,633
I've been telling these girls

698
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,802
all these different things, and

699
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:44,428
I walked up on all three of them

700
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,346
talking to each other, and I'm

701
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,015
worried.

702
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,516
I'm definitely worried.

703
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,649
I feel like all of the women

704
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,026
here think I'm full of crap.

705
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,068
>> Don't you know everyone is

706
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:00,902
going to talk?

707
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,946
>> Yeah, I know.

708
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:09,953
>> Well, you need to pick one

709
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:10,829
side or the other.

710
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,164
You can't keep flipping.

711
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,373
You don't want to be with me

712
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,583
because you think I'm a threat.

713
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,417
And then you want to vote me

714
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,376
out.

715
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,669
And then all of a sudden, we're,

716
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,920
like, best friends.

717
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:19,546
And then I hear from everyone

718
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,757
else that you still are planning

719
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,550
on voting me out.

720
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,427
>> I make so many mistakes.

721
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,137
I know the girls don't trust me

722
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:27,596
at all.

723
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,015
And I'm scared I'm the next to

724
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,308
go.

725
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,726
I can't stress how important it

726
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,144
is that I win the next immunity.

727
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,395
Right now it's just like the

728
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,521
animal kingdom.

729
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:37,564
It's either you win and survive

730
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:40,067
or you fail and you die.

731
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,907
>> JEFF: Come on in, guys!

732
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,581
I'll now bring in Parvati,

733
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,751
returning from Exile Island.

734
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,545
>> Hey, Parv.

735
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,463
>> JEFF: You guys ready to get

736
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,882
to today's challenge?

737
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,217
Erik, I'll take back the

738
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,303
necklace once again.

739
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:09,137
>> Here you go.

740
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:09,805
>> It's good to see you.

741
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:10,472
>> Hi, baby!

742
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:10,639
>> Hi!

743
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,058
>> Hey, girl.

744
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,017
>> JEFF: Once again, immunity is

745
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,852
back up for grabs.

746
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,062
For today's challenge, you will

747
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,605
work to solve three puzzles.

748
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:21,566
Using a set of coordinates, you

749
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,902
will cross two ropes.

750
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,238
Where the ropes intersect,

751
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,489
you'll dig down to find a bag of

752
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,116
puzzle pieces.

753
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,408
Race back to your answer board,

754
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:30,826
solve the puzzle.

755
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,536
That puzzle will give you your

756
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,413
next set of coordinates, leading

757
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,831
you to another bag of puzzle

758
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,290
pieces.

759
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,458
The first person to solve all

760
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,503
three puzzles wins immunity, and

761
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,754
is guaranteed a spot in the

762
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,005
final four.

763
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,674
Losers, after 36 days, somebody

764
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:46,675
will be going home.

765
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,927
We'll draw for lanes, we'll get

766
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,221
started.

767
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,562
Here we go, for immunity and a

768
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,604
guaranteed spot in the final

769
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,772
four.

770
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,817
Survivors ready.

771
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,069
Go!

772
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,406
First plank will give you your

773
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:13,326
first set of coordinates.

774
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,287
You'll cross two ropes.

775
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,164
Where the ropes intersect,

776
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:17,789
you'll dig down to find a bag of

777
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,624
puzzle pieces.

778
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,169
That will give you your next set

779
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,213
of coordinates.

780
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:35,557
>> Sorry.

781
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,808
>> JEFF: Erik's crossed his

782
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:37,809
first two ropes.

783
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,269
He's digging for those puzzle

784
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:39,561
pieces.

785
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,898
Parvati starts digging.

786
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,070
Erik has his first bag, heading

787
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,156
back to solve his first puzzle.

788
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,283
Natalie is now digging.

789
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,160
Cirie now starts digging.

790
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,329
Amanda thinks she has it.

791
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,622
Now Amanda is digging.

792
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,005
Cirie comes back with her bag of

793
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,299
puzzle pieces.

794
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,095
Amanda has her first bag of

795
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,765
puzzle pieces.

796
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:19,851
Erik has solved his first

797
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,603
puzzle, heading back out with

798
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,648
another set of coordinates.

799
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,359
Cirie has solved her first

800
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,361
puzzle.

801
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,451
Cirie now has her second set of

802
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:38,078
coordinates, heading back out.

803
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,412
Natalie has her first bag of

804
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,997
puzzle pieces.

805
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:41,706
>> Come on, baby!

806
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,917
>> JEFF: Erik has his second bag

807
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,584
of puzzle pieces.

00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:47,128
Amanda now heading out with her

809
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,714

Cirie has her two ropes in

813
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:56,930
place.

814
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,056
She's going to start digging,

815
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,266
hoping she remembered the right

816
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,685
symbols.

817
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,561
>> Turtle, white fish, bird,

818
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:04,396
seagull.

Turtle, white fish, bird,

820
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,731

00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:09,818
seagull.

825
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,987
>> JEFF: Erik solved his second

826
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,946
puzzle, heading out for that

third and final set of puzzle

828
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,408
pieces.

Natalie looking for that second

830
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,327
bag.

831
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,996
Erik with a big lead now.

832
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,664
Amanda, Cirie still digging.

833
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,292
Parvati nowhere close to being

834
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,626
in this challenge.

835
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,794
>> Oh, Jeff!

836
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:34,009
>> Bird, seagull.

837
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,427
Seagull.

838
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,595
Seagull, seagull, seagull.

839
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,766
>> JEFF: Erik lines up his

840
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,892
ropes, digging for that third

00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,227
and final bag of puzzle pieces.

842
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,478
Natalie, Amanda, Cirie trying to

843
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,522
stay in this.

844
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,571
Erik has his third and final bag

845
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:55,697
of puzzle pieces!

846
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,823
Heading back to solve that final

847
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,700
puzzle.

848
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,453
Cirie, Amanda, and Natalie still

849
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:01,828
digging.

850
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:05,248
Parvati now heading out, looking

851
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,541
for that second set of

852
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,667
coordinates.

853
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,003
>> Oh, come on!

854
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:12,422
>> JEFF: Erik with a huge lead.

855
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,845
It is Erik's challenge to lose

856
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:19,763
at this point.

857
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,681
Guaranteed spot in the final

858
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,892
four if you win it.

859
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,867
Erik thinks he has it.

860
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,119
Guaranteed final four.

861
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,789
Erik wins immunity once again!

862
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,336
>> Damn.

863
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,630
>> JEFF: Once again, immunity is

864
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,131
yours.

865
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,508
And with this around your neck,

866
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:57,467
are you safe at tonight's tribal

867
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,593
council.

868
00:27:58,676 --> 00:27:59,844
Erik is guaranteed a spot in the

869
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:00,887
final four.

870
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,805
Amanda, Natalie, Parvati, Cirie,

871
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,182
for one of you, your shot at the

872
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:04,933
million dollars will come to an

873
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,769
end tonight at tribal council.

874
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:08,853
Grab your stuff.

875
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,064
Head back to camp.

876
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,331
>> I just want you guys to tell

877
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,290
me.

878
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,291
>> Tell you what?

879
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,626
>> Just tell me if it's... if

880
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,837
it's me.

881
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,171
>> The way it's looking,

882
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,297
probably.

883
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,882
>> Yeah.

884
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,676
>> Yesterday, he worked us all

885
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,261
like cheap suits.

886
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,097
He told us all three same thing.

887
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,224
>> Wow.

888
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,642
>> Busted.

889
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:48,977
>> He got busted?

890
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,061
>> Mm-hmm.

891
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,313
>> That sucks that he won!

892
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,232
God.

893
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,400
If he didn't have that necklace,

894
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,026
he'd be gone.

895
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:04,993
Probably not, huh?

896
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:05,994
>> What?

897
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,871
>> If he would give you his

898
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:08,788
necklace.

899
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:09,330
Do you think you could talk

900
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:09,831
him into giving you the

901
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,542
necklace?

902
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:15,170
>> Nat, work your magic.

903
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,254
You can convince him to give it

904
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,088
to you.

905
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,089
>> Why would it benefit him

906
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,257
giving me the necklace?

907
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,383
>> Say, "I'll convince the

908
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,009
jury..." you know, "They'll know

909
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,927
everything you've done.

910
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,095
They're not going to vote for

911
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,054
you anyways.

912
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:25,930
Everyone is mad at you at this

913
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,056
point."

914
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:27,932
You know, "This is one way you

915
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,059
can redeem yourself."

916
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,311
Just go off.

917
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:32,687
>> Nat, tell him if he were to

918
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:33,813
give you the necklace, that

919
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,316
would redeem him, and we would

920
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:36,858
vote for Amanda.

921
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,486
>> Who would fall for that?

922
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,111
Like, I feel stupid listening to

923
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,071
you right now.

924
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,199
>> Ozzy, Jason, and Erik.

925
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:44,949
He belongs in that threesome.

926
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,744
He belongs in that trio.

927
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,079
>> You're good at this, Nat.

928
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,831
>> Yeah, but, I mean, this is

929
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,083
just ridiculous.

930
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,211
I mean, I'll try it, but... I'll

931
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,337
say I talked to Cirie about it,

932
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,671
she's down with voting Amanda.

933
00:29:58,755 --> 00:29:59,214
>> But the only way I'll go

934
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,216
along is if he saves you.

935
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,717
>> Right, right, right, right.

936
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,843
>> Because I don't believe him.

937
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,220
I have to see him save you to

938
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,721
believe that he'll vote Amanda,

939
00:30:06,804 --> 00:30:07,680
because of all the stuff he's

940
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:08,681
been saying.

941
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:09,724
Perfect.

942
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:10,934
>> I think it could work.

943
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,269
>> It depends on how good you

944
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,938
are with this right here.

945
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:22,737
>> Honestly, I'm on my way home

946
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,738
packing tonight.

947
00:30:23,821 --> 00:30:24,656
But I had the most harebrained

948
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:25,532
idea.

949
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:26,491
>> Okay.

950
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,367
>> I'll run it by you, you make

951
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,203
your decision.

952
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,079
>> Harebrained.

953
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:31,913
I can relate.

954
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:32,247
>> It's crazy.

955
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,790
>> Okay.

956
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:37,043
>> But it's brilliant.

957
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,336
Myself or Amanda are your

958
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,337
biggest threats, right?

959
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,129
That's who you want...

960
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:40,880
>> That's how I feel.

961
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:41,089
>> Okay.

962
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,174
>> Yeah.

963
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,594
>> Well, what if me, you, and

964
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,013
Cirie vote Amanda tonight?

965
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,267
>> Okay.

966
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,685
>> This is where it gets funny

967
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:54,852
and tricky.

968
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:55,395
You give me your necklace.

969
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,021
>> I'm not even going to

970
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:57,981
consider that.

971
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,107
>> Just hear me out.

972
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,400
If you give me your necklace

973
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,484
tonight, Cirie said she would

974
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,068
hands down vote for Amanda.

975
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,903
That's all we need.

976
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,905
>> What's wrong with voting for

977
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:06,948
Amanda without me giving up the

978
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,659
necklace?

979
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:10,868
Everybody thinks I'm an idiot

980
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,745
right now.

981
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,663
>> I'm just thinking jury votes

982
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,372
for you.

983
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,164
Because you're riding this thing

984
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:15,665
all the way to the end.

985
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:16,833
>> When I get there, I'm not

986
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:17,625
going to have anybody.

987
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,501
>> Right.

988
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:19,544
We were thinking you

989
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,588
redeem yourself with the jury.

990
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,964
I just think it would be a huge,

991
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,882
pivotal move for you.

992
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:25,633
Because you're going to need a

993
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,426
pivotal move if you want a jury

994
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,385
vote.

995
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,344
>> Mm-hmm.

996
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,929
I have felt like I don't have a

997
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:30,972
lot of jury votes.

998
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,890
>> Yeah.

999
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,684
>> All right, let me talk to

1000
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,019
Cirie.

1001
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:40,481
>> At this point, Amanda is a

1002
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,357
threat.

1003
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,358
There's no question.

1004
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,067
What is the problem with me

1005
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,110
keeping immunity and still

1006
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:46,362
voting Amanda?

1007
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,447
>> Because I don't... I don't

1008
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,656
know if I would believe that you

1009
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,824
would vote Amanda.

1010
00:31:49,907 --> 00:31:50,158
>> Right.

1011
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,951
>> I wish I could, like, trust

1012
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,829
you in the fact of just you

1013
00:31:54,912 --> 00:31:57,040
saying it, but you kind of...

1014
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,333
>> Blew that up.

1015
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,792
>> ...took that all away.

1016
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:00,877
>> My word isn't good anymore.

1017
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,919
>> No.

1018
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:02,420
>> And I'm all sketchy.

1019
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:03,004
>> Exactly.

1020
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,088
>> I'm like this.

1021
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,923
>> So what do I do?

1022
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:06,758
Do I... that's why it has to be

1023
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:07,634
that way.

1024
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:08,259
I mean, I know it's hard to ask

1025
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,095
somebody to give up immunity,

1026
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,056
but for me, if you were to save

1027
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,558
Nat, then I would believe you,

1028
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,268
and that would cue me that we're

1029
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,603
all going to vote Amanda.

1030
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:22,023
We've thrown the line out to

1031
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,608
Erik, and I think he's nibbling

1032
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,109
around the edges.

1033
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,444
>> I have to think about it.

1034
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,905
>> Yeah, of course, I'm sure.

1035
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:31,491
If Erik takes that necklace off,

1036
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,201
his torch would be snuffed so

1037
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,202
quick, I don't even think he

1038
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,245
could have time to blink his

1039
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,206
eyes.

1040
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,208
Oh, I just don't know, you know?

1041
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,125
Erik is a pretty smart guy.

1042
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,211
So it's like a 50-50 shot.

1043
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:46,381
Him being blasted at tribal

1044
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,006
could push him over the edge.

1045
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,258
Even if he doesn't make up his

1046
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,177
mind before we go, at tribal,

1047
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,804
you and Parvati blast him, and

1048
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:53,388
me and Natalie won't so he can

1049
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,432
be thinking, like, "Maybe this

1050
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:57,350
will be a good move."

1051
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,059
>> Okay.

1052
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:58,976
>> That's all I want to say.

1053
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,686
I don't want him to see me

1054
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:02,146
talking to you.

1055
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:03,606
>> I'm scared about immunity,

1056
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,150
the hidden immunity.

1057
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,527
Because I feel like Parvati

1058
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,111
found it, and she has it, and

1059
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,946
she's going to give it to

1060
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:10,196
Amanda.

1061
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,573
What is the possibility that you

1062
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,867
guys will vote Parv with me

1063
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,077
instead of Amanda?

1064
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,415
>> Well, if it makes more sense

1065
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,791
and you feel more comfortable

1066
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:22,917
going a different route.

1067
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,167
>> Right.

1068
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,253
Like, I feel like all the girls

1069
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,212
like, "Let's get Erik."

1070
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,047
>> I get your concern.

1071
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:32,009
I get you having to angle out

1072
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,803
every possible angle.

1073
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:34,846
I get it.

1074
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:35,763
>> I'm still scared... I'm just

1075
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:36,639
being honest.

1076
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,682
That's my fear.

1077
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,225
>> No, I get it, but just go out

1078
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:40,351
on a limb.

1079
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,686
Go out on a limb.

1080
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,397
>> I don't know.

1081
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:55,116
>> He's worried about the hidden

1082
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,409
immunity, and he would feel much

1083
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:57,618
better if the three of us voted

1084
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,036
for Parv.

1085
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,288
He is afraid Parv's going to

1086
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,331
pull the idol.

1087
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:03,750
>> All right, I'll agree with

1088
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:04,876
anything right now.

1089
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:05,460
Girl, we've got him on a hook.

1090
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,086
We've got him on the hook.

1091
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:07,670
We've just got to reel him in.

1092
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,297
It would be the ultimate Jedi

1093
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,048
mind trick.

1094
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,718
I just don't know-- will he buy

1095
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,178
it?

1096
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,568
>> JEFF: We'll now bring in the

1097
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,110
members of our jury.

1098
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:39,786
Eliza, Ozzy, Jason, James, and

1099
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,913
Alexis, voted out at the last

1100
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,581
tribal council.

1101
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,250
Erik, let's talk about the

1102
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,251
reward challenge.

1103
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,545
You decide to bring Amanda with

1104
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,506
you after she had completely

1105
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:54,008
worked you at the last tribal

1106
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:55,426
council.

1107
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,511
>> Well, I felt like I needed to

1108
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,762
redeem myself, and I felt like

1109
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:58,346
that she could see it as some

1110
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,264
kind of nice gesture to kind of

1111
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,724
bury the hatchet.

1112
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,685
>> JEFF: So, Parvati, tell me

1113
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,604
about your time on Exile.

1114
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,773
>> It ended up being, like, a

1115
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:09,357
little nice mini-vacation for

1116
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,150
me.

1117
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,777
But when I got back from Exile,

1118
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,946
I heard about Erik running

1119
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,364
around and making alliances with

1120
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,658
every single person, and then

1121
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:19,283
breaking their alliances, and

1122
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,369
then switching back up, and

1123
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,537
switching back over, when he

1124
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,663
didn't even need to do that.

1125
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,289
He'd won immunity for the past

1126
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,041
three times in a row.

1127
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:27,625
So I was happy to be on Exile,

1128
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,378
actually, to be away from that.

1129
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,170
>> JEFF: Erik, what's it feel

1130
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:34,674
like to hear Parvati out you,

1131
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:35,258
saying you made alliances with

1132
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,218
everybody here, you lied to

1133
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,469
everybody here, and all the

1134
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,679
women are nodding their head

1135
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:40,388
going, "Yep, yep, yep, yep"?

1136
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,473
>> I was nodding my head with

1137
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,850
them, because everyone

1138
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,143
basically turned around and went

1139
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,143
to each other and said, "Hey,

1140
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,062
Erik's full of crap.

1141
00:35:48,145 --> 00:35:48,980
Erik's telling everybody what

1142
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:49,772
they want to hear."

1143
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:50,565
It was stupid.

1144
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,566
It was just a mistake.

1145
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,525
And I feel like I need to come

1146
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:53,484
to this tribal tonight and ask

1147
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,069
for some kind of forgiveness,

1148
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:56,571
some kind of "I'm sorry."

1149
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,613
>> The thing, is Erik your word

1150
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,031
means nothing to anybody anymore

1151
00:35:59,115 --> 00:35:59,907
at all.

1152
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:00,741
>> Exactly.

1153
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,659
>> You say you're sorry, and,

1154
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:02,493
like, take me on a reward, and

1155
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,287
that's great and all, but you

1156
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,329
only took me to get my vote on

1157
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,999
the jury.

1158
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,041
And not only that, but

1159
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:09,959
everything that you were telling

1160
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:10,751
me on the reward you've told

1161
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:11,294
her, you've told her, you've

1162
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,754
told her.

1163
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,797
>> Well, that's what I'm coming

1164
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,173
forward about right now.

1165
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,133
That's what I'm trying to say

1166
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,092
right now.

1167
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:18,926
>> But it's too late!

1168
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:19,760
Don't you see?

1169
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:20,720
>> I mean, you've just lost a

1170
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:21,762
lot of respect among the women

1171
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,347
here you're sitting with.

1172
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,307
>> I know this.

1173
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,349
It's not like I can't... and I'm

1174
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,225
not going to deny it right now.

1175
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,226
I'm not going to pretend I did

1176
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,269
not say the things that I said.

1177
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,228
>> Because you can't!

1178
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:29,770
>> Because I can't, exactly.

1179
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,523
I mean, game aside, I'm hoping

1180
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,691
there's some sense of

1181
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,817
forgiveness, some sense of,

1182
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:35,860
"We'll try and trust you again."

1183
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:36,777
>> You can't say, "Game aside,"

1184
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:37,904
because we're playing this game.

1185
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:38,779
>> That's true.

1186
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:39,697
>> We're in this game right now.

1187
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,489
You can't say, "Game aside, I

1188
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:41,574
apologize."

1189
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,075
This is the game.

1190
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:43,409
>> I'm sorry.

1191
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,494
I am sorry.

1192
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:46,913
I just want to tell you that, if

1193
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:52,877
it means anything at all.

1194
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,878
>> JEFF: Erik, what's it going

1195
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,087
to take for you to actually win

1196
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:55,338
this game?

1197
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,464
>> That's been a question that's

1198
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,465
concerned me.

1199
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,467
I mean, I'm looking down the

1200
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,801
road here to the final, and I

1201
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,385
don't see any friendly faces.

1202
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,512
I don't see anybody on the jury

1203
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,097
that's going to say, "Hey, you

1204
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:05,598
did a pretty good job."

1205
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,475
Or, "You didn't backstab me,"

1206
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,893
or, "You didn't lie to my face."

1207
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,144
And especially after what I did

1208
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,395
to piss everybody off here.

1209
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,981
I mean, I need some kind of

1210
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:14,982
redemption before I can have a

1211
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,194
chance of considering myself in

1212
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:18,486
the finals.

1213
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,947
>> JEFF: Cirie, is it realistic

1214
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,405
to say, "I'm sorry?"

1215
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,366
Does it matter if you redeem

1216
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,700
yourself?

1217
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,244
>> I think it does matter, Jeff,

1218
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,371
because, ultimately, it lies in

1219
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,331
the hands of the people who are

1220
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,750
voted out this late and become

1221
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,126
jury members.

1222
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,045
So I think you are able to

1223
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,713
redeem yourself, and I think

1224
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:38,381
it's really important that you

1225
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,549
do, especially if you've been

1226
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,176
discredited.

1227
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:43,302
If you've been discredited, the

1228
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,012
words you say means absolutely

1229
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,347
nothing.

1230
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,390
It's your actions that will show

1231
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:48,516
and prove what's really going

1232
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,685
on.

1233
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,478
>> JEFF: All right, let's get to

1234
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:53,604
the vote.

1235
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,981
Erik, you have the individual

1236
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,107
immunity necklace.

1237
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,191
As always, you can give it up to

1238
00:37:57,274 --> 00:37:58,234
somebody if you choose to.

1239
00:37:58,317 --> 00:37:59,568
Otherwise, it is yours, and you

1240
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:03,364
are safe tonight.

1241
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,991
>> This is a very tough decision

1242
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,742
for me, for a lot of reasons.

1243
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:07,535
As a competitor, I always say,

1244
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,536
"You know what?

1245
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,163
Keep your fate in our own

1246
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,164
hands."

1247
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:12,957
But there is so much weighing on

1248
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,666
my mind.

1249
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:14,417
I've made a lot of mistakes in

1250
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:14,875
the past couple days.

1251
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:15,543
And I know that actions do speak

1252
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,128
louder than words.

1253
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,087
I want to give individual

1254
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,256
immunity to Natalie.

1255
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,187
>> JEFF: Suddenly, Natalie, you

1256
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,647
are safe.

1257
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,317
Big change right before the

1258
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,609
vote.

1259
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,069
Natalie is now safe from the

1260
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,112
vote.

1261
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,447
Everybody else is fair game.

1262
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,573
And it is time to vote.

1263
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,825
Erik, you're up.

1264
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:04,800
>> I'm voting for Parvati.

1265
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:05,509
You've got to take some risks

1266
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,594
sometime and hope people keep

1267
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,138
their word.

1268
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,223
Oh, god!

1269
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,023
>> I don't even know what to

1270
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:20,107
say.

1271
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,610
But thank you.

1272
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,825
>> You know...

1273
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,878
>> My mother always told me,

1274
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,630
"You may not be able to beat

1275
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,673
them with these all time, but

1276
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:45,883
you can always beat them with

1277
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:46,634
this."

1278
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,762
Sorry.

1279
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,643
>> You're crazy!

1280
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,852
You officially go down as the

1281
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,562
dumbest survivor ever in the

1282
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,565
history of<i> Survivor,</i> ever.

1283
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:10,699
>> JEFF: I'll go tally the

1284
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,285
votes.

1285
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,047
>> JEFF: If anybody has the

1286
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:25,631
hidden immunity idol and you

1287
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:26,549
want to play it, now would be

1288
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:29,718
the time to do so.

1289
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,517
Okay, once the votes are read,

1290
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,643
the decision is final.

1291
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:38,644
The person voted out will be

1292
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:39,562
asked to leave the tribal

1293
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:40,729
council area immediately.

1294
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,274
I'll read the votes.

1295
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,402
First vote.

1296
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:48,988
Erik.

1297
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,659
Parvati.

1298
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,661
One vote Erik, one vote Parvati.

1299
00:40:58,706 --> 00:40:59,623
Erik.

1300
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:02,877
Two votes Erik.

1301
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:06,630
13th person voted out and the

1302
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,799
sixth member of our jury, Erik.

1303
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:09,758
That's three.

1304
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:10,718
That's enough.

1305
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,803
You need to bring me your torch.

1306
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:16,098
>> You guys drive me crazy.

1307
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,142
>> I've lost my reign as dumbest

1308
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,560
survivor ever.

1309
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,480
>> I should have known better.

1310
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,444
>> JEFF: Erik, the tribe has

1311
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,571
spoken.

1312
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,711
>> JEFF: I think that is what

1313
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:48,172
you call a life lesson.

1314
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,257
Three days left in this game.

1315
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:50,799
Who knows what is going to

1316
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,551
happen?

1317
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:53,761
Grab your torches.

1318
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:54,595

>> JEFF: Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>

1329
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,951
The season with the most

1330
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:20,871
injuries, evacuations...

1331
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:24,375
Jason.

1332
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,376

00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:25,751
Alexis.

1335
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,389
>> Damn, damn!

1336
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:38,681
They got me!

1337
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:39,640
I should have known better.

1338
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:40,641
Those damn girls.

1339
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,559
I mean, there's one thing to be

1340
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:43,435
said about surviving the

1341
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,228
elements and there's another

1342
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:45,854
thing to be said about surviving

1343
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,816
four crazy, sexy women.

1344
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:49,775
I never thought I would be

1345
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:50,359
shoulder to shoulder with all

1346
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:51,527
these people that I've seen on

1347
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,194
TV.

1348
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:52,903
These are my heroes.

1349
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:53,654
And they're talking to me.

1350
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:54,571
They acknowledged me as a

1351
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:55,239
person.

1352
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:56,031
This whole experience is

1353
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,117
undescribable.
