<i>Survivor: Tocantins</i> have seen

3
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:21,771
some of the most memorable

4
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,064
castaways yet.

5
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:26,025
They've been competing fiercely

6
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,319
in one of the most unforgiving

7
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,947
environments in the world.

8
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:31,489
This is what you've seen so

9
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:34,826
far.

10
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:35,243
Survivors ready?

11
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:38,288
Go!

12
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,166
Timbira wins immunity!

13
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,083
>> That's not okay.

14
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:42,625
>> Who the hell do you think

15
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:43,793
you are?

16
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:44,627
>> That will get old really

17
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,295
quick.

18
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,087
>> PROBST: Carolina, the tribe

19
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,213
has spoken.

20
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:50,216
Candace trying to take Taj down.

21
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,843
J.T. fakes out Jerry!

22
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:52,469
Jalapao wins.

23

member of Timbira to Exile

25
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:58,349
Island.

26
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,476
>> Now, to the twist, choose

27
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,227
one member of the winning tribe

28
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,145
to join you.

29
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,190

30
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,399
>> You work Sierra.

31
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,650
I'll work Steve.

32
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,402
We would have a four-way

33
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,070
alliance that nobody knows

34
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:11,863
about.

35
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:12,655
>> That nobody knows about.

36
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,531
>> Exactly.

37
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,824
>> You're the best accomplice

38
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,242
ever.

39
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,286
>> I think they're going to be

40
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,579
under- or overcooked.

41
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,413
>> Hopefully, Candace has her

42
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,706
bags packed because she is out

43
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,124

>> Debbie, where's our bucket?

48
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:28,546
>> I don't know.

49
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,672

she's crazy.

history?

63
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:51,528
>> Yes, I do.

64
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,362
>> Okay, stuff this in your

65
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,530
pocket.

66
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,197
Do something with it.

67
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,365
Hide it.

>> Yeah, J.T.!

74
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,793

76
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,462

>> Somebody has to go tonight.

78
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,339
It's gotta be Spence.

heat of the Brazilian highlands,

94
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,481
traveling on a dusty, endless

road to nowhere, this season's

96
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,944
castaways were split into two

97
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,071
tribes, and they were about to

98
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,156
begin a cutthroat game where

99

good amount of time to just

104
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,081
kind of size everybody up and

into it with too many because

109
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,504
I think that gets you in trouble

girl in the gray striped

113
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:23,096
T-shirt, obviously, was upset;

114
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,597
she had her head down, and, yes,

115
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,182
it was hot, we were all hot, but

116
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:27,725
we weren't showing it.

117
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,393
And so, I really didn't feel

118
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,394
like she wanted to be here with

119
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,478
us.

120
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:33,898

00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,316
I had a fever.

can.

child of Stephen Segal and the

skills like an Indian or, uh,

142
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,942
karate moves like Stephen Segal,

143
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,277
he's a good guy to have on your

144
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,862
side, I think.

00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:23,823
Now, is that going to be a

148
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:24,824
shared role?

149
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:25,700

qualities that I have as an

152
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,579
individual has been forged like

153
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,790
an iron thrown into the fire and

154
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:33,499
coming out unshakable,

155
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,460
unbreakable, invincible like a

156
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,836
sword.

157
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:37,503
I know who I am.

158
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,504

159
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,631
They have Stephen Segal.

160
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,507
What the hell are we going to

161
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,593
do against the (indistinct) man?

162
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,219
I have no idea.

163
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:45,803
We clearly have, physically, a

164
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:46,554
weaker tribe.

165
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,597
Um, there's the hot, blonde

166
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,431
girl.

167
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,515
It really is going to be a

168
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,392
shame when we have to vote her

169
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,643
off.

170
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,228
>> I guess I'm, you know, a

171
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,772
professional model now.

172
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,023
I mean, I've been doing it for

173
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,566
three and a half years, but, um,

174
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,276
yeah, I don't know, it's still

175
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,527
kind of funny to me because I

176
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:05,073
just, I laugh at myself a lot.

177
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,449
>> PROBST: You guys have a long

178
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,784
journey ahead of you.

179
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,452
You need to get to camp.

180
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,787
You need to start working on

181
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,914
shelter.

182
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,793
The tribes began an epic

183
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,460
four-hour journey toward their

184
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,504
camps, but Jalapao stumbled out

185
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,505
of the gate.

186
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,508
>> This was our mark, right?

187
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,885
I'm not afraid to run back to

188
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,678
the road and look at it.

189
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,971
>> I think that might be our

190
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,515
best point, our best idea.

191
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:30,890
>> You think so?

192
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,350
>> Yeah, I would definitely

193
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:32,975
because I'm not sure what tree

194
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,520
we're looking at.

195
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,107
>> As long as we don't veer off

196
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,399
that line, I know we do avoid

197
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:40,983
trees and stuff, it will still

198
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,693
be the same degree.

199
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,569
>> That's true.

200
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,612
That's true, all right.

201
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:45,905
>> If we just hit that strip

202
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,323
of palm trees, we'll be fine.

203
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:47,990
>> Well, J.T.'s, he's from 'Bama

204
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,326
>> That's right.

205
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,286
>> J.T. is more of a brawn guy,

206
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,330
not your sophisticate,

207
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,958
intellect, academia-type guy.

208
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,084
>> People's impression of me

209
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,293
might be that I'm a hillbilly

210
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,545
sometimes, uh, but I consider a

211
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,505
hillbilly someone uneducated.

212
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,258
I don't think a hillbilly would

213
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,676
make it very far in this game.

214
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,511
Uh, there's no doubt in my mind

215
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,053
I can win or I'd have stayed

216
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,471
at home.

217
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,597
I'm here to win and I'm going

218
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,723
to win.

219
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:13,850
>> Are we going the right way,

220
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,059
y'all?

221
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,060
My biggest strategy going in

222
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,061
will just be "kill them with

223
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:17,812
kindness."

224
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:18,729
I'll be so nice to them, they're

225
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:19,730
not going to want to kick me

226
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,565
off.

227
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:20,898
You guys okay?

228
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,401
Okay.

229
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,694
Because another thing I think

230
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:25,570
that they're probably

231
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,029
underestimating about me is

232
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,574
that I look fat.

233
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,160
But I'm not really fat.

234
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,163
I'm muscular.

235
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:35,788
So, when I'm winning challenges,

236
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,707
they won't have a reason to try

237
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,040
to kick me off.

238
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:38,499
They can't.

239
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,626
I'm going to be so good at this

240
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,753
they won't be ready for me.

241
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,672
>> Whoo!

242
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,133
(cheering)

243
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:57,435
(squealing)

244
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,311
>> Chew it! Chew it!

245
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,145
Don't waste it.

246
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,021
>> I guess it's like God's

247
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,063
candy.

248
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,064
>> Is this for real?

249
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,192
>> Thanks, God.

250
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,722
>> PROBST: On their first full

251
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:35,681
day at camp, but without fire to

252
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,850
cook their beans...

253
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:38,809
>> What happens if you just eat

254
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:39,894
dry beans?

255
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:40,728
>> PROBST: ...Timbira had to

256
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:41,562
resort to other sources of food

257
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,941
for much-needed protein.

258
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:45,691
>> Did you get it?

259
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:45,900
>> No.

260
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,652
>> I think it's going to be a

261
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,569
lot harder than anybody

262
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,238
realizes out here.

263
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,447
Foraging for food is going to be

264
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,199
difficult.

265
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,450
Dang.

266
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:55,785
>> I'm getting slower, I think.

267
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,078
Want to give it a try?

268
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:57,662
>> We're trying to catch fish.

269
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,747
We've got a burlap bag and

270
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,998
we try to drop different things

271
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,041
in and grab fish.

272
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:02,833
>> You got one?

273
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:03,960
>> Yes, a teeny little one.

274
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,004
>> At least it's one.

275
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:07,880
>> Eat it.

276
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,590
Eat that.

277
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,259
>> You go, you go, Debbie.

278
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,301
>> I'll eat that one that

279
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,219
you've got in your hands.

280
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,220
>> Why, because this guy...

281
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,429
>> Yeah, 'cause that one's

282
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:15,638
gross.

283
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,639
Ugh!

284
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,475
>> Put your mouth there.

285
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:21,811
>> Uh, okay.

286
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,271
>> Chew it! Chew it!

287
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:23,896
>> Chew it.

288
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,855
Don't just waste it.

289
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,774
Yummy, sushi, sashimi.

290
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:27,692
Mmm.

291
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,695
>> Okay, it actually did taste

292
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,280
a little like sushi.

293
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,406
That is definitely not in my

294
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,699
character, but I threw it in my

295
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:35,783
mouth and chewed it up as quick

296
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:36,742
as I could to get a little

297
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,202
protein.

298
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,495
I cannot believe I just chewed

299
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:43,040
up a live fish in my teeth.

300
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:43,916
>> I'm gonna clean these

301
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,834
things out.

302
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,127
>> The fish, we have just those

303
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,753
little minnows to eat, but we

304
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,339
found, uh, that fruit that

305
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,549
smells like foot.

306
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:52,300
>> Jerry!

307
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,092
>> Yeah.

308
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,552
>> All that jatoba.

309
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,680
Shut your mouth!

310
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,889
>> No, it's really, it's better

311
00:09:58,973 --> 00:09:59,807
than eating the...

312
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,350
>> I'm having a hard time

313
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,351
sticking this in my mouth.

314
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,269
>> Come on. It's good.

315
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,520
>> This is a Brazilian fruit

316
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:07,732
called a jatoba, and, uh, it's

317
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,900
got like a really hard, like,

318
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,486
pod shell on it, and then inside

319
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,488
it's got this almost powdery

320
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:14,780
flesh.

321
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,325
It really makes you thirsty.

322
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:17,950
It kind of sucks all the saliva

323
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,454
out of your mouth.

324
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:27,793
>> Is this for real?

325
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:28,794
>> Yeah.

326
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,921
>> Come on. How is it?

327
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,682
>> Uh-uh.

328
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,310
>> But here, there's nothing

329
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,895
else to eat, so, it's, I guess

330
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,772
it's like God's candy in Brazil.

331
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,899
So, thanks, God.

332
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,571
>> PROBST: On day seven, after

333
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:56,739
winning comfort items in a

334
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:57,782
reward challenge, Jalapao's

335
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,825
campfire was out and getting the

336
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,244
fire restarted proved to be a

337
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,038
tough task.

338
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,165
(metal and wood scratching)

339
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,376
>> I'm doing something wrong

340
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,628
here.

341
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,840
>> Try to strike into it more.

342
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:15,966
>> Like that?

343
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:22,515
>> Strike it.

344
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:22,848
>> Strike it.

345
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:23,474
>> There you go.

346
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,141
>> Strike it. Like, hit it.

347
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:24,934
>> There you go.

348
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,771
>> That's how I did it.

349
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,272
>> Stephen really wanted to

350
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,315
make a fire because he's never

351
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,149
made a fire.

352
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:32,942
He's out there with the flint,

353
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,653
with the machete, dinging away.

354
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:36,695
It was hilarious.

355
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,156
He could not make a freaking

356
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,283
spark.

357
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,668
>> On the scale of 1 to 100,

358
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:51,752
my wilderness skills are at

359
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,963
about a 1.

360
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,382
I cannot make fire, and that is

361
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,134
embarrassing.

362
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,220
Aah!

363
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,346
I'll do it some other time.

364
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:02,888
This is stupid.

365
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:03,931
>> Sure?

366
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:04,640
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

367
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,892
>> All right.

368
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:07,893
I might not be able to start

369
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:08,602
it, either.

370
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,729
(chuckles)

371
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,650
>> I grew up fishing with my

372
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,652
dad outdoors all the time, so

373
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:17,570
I've-I...

374
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:18,612
you know, I've lived the

375
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,739
outdoors.

376
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,660
I'm not just a girly girl, you

377
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:24,994
know.

378
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,620
I'm not just some pretty girl

379
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,329
that they're...

380
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,998
You know, they can flirt with.

381
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,879
(sighing)

382
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,223
>> Yes.

383
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,308
>> Good job, Syd.

384
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,018
>> Oh, nice, Sydney.

385
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,686
<i>Fuego.</i>

386
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:51,812
(chuckles)

387
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,189
>> At first, Sydney was

388
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,315
definitely getting by on her

389
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,484
looks, on her charm, on her

390
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,610
girlish laugh.

391
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:58,777
But Sydney made fire for us,

392
00:12:58,861 --> 00:12:59,153
you know?

393
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,197
She's a woodland goddess and I

394
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:01,822
think, for that reason, she's a

395
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,616
big threat to me.

396
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:07,703
(laughing)

397
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,580
>> PROBST: At Timbira, Tyson was

398
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,080
busy enhancing the first

399
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,458
impression he'd made on his

400
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,168
fellow castaways, proving that

401
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,961
value to a tribe can come in

402
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,004
many ways.

403
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,464
>> I smell like a man today.

404
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,425
(laughing)

405
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,635
They think I just always smell

406
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,387
like flowers and exotic fruits.

407
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,140
Who am I?

408
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,267
Um...

409
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,981
Oh, that question.

410
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,526
Who am I?

411
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,696
Pretty well-balanced individual,

412
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,197
I'd say.

413
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,324
>> Oh, my God!

414
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:45,866
>> Let's win!

415
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,076
>> Oh, God.

416
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,161
(gasping)

417
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,080
>> Tyson never, ever ceases to

418
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,915
amaze me.

419
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:53,832
>> I can do that.

420
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,586
(laughing)

421
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,880
>> Oh, my God.

422
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,257
>> See?

423
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,299
>> Did you see the arch in his

424
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:02,883
back?

425
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:03,842
>> Yeah, you have to do the

426
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:04,051
arch.

427
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:04,426
It pops better.

428
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,010
>> I don't even know how to do

429
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,012
the arch thing.

430
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,015
Honestly, I think Tyson is

431
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:10,599
somebody that everybody better

432
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,725
watch out.

433
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,185
I think Tyson has the real

434
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,312
potential to win this game.

435
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:22,695
>> Try and get through this.

436
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,113
>> A little Tai Bo here, or

437
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:24,280
what?

438
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,281
Are you sparring?

439
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:25,990
What are you doing?

440
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:26,865
>> I was going to kick her in

441
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,325
the (bleep).

442
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:28,909
(laughing)

443
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,537
>> Tyson, he's always cracking

444
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,371
a joke.

445
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,455
One of a kind.

446
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,164
I mean, that's probably what

447
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,124
attracts me to him so much,

448
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:39,253
you know, not in a sexual way.

449
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,629
>> Take you to the ground right

450
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,756
here.

451
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,634
(laughing)

452
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:45,968
Ow.

453
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:49,888
>> What you doing, Debbie?

454
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,016
(laughing)

455
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:52,308
>> Debbie.

456
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,518
>> I want you to stop.

457
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,228
>> Stop doing that to me.

458
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,187
My parents are going to see

459
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:57,938
that, Debra!

460
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,233
>> You weren't very quick to

461
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:01,483
get off.

462
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,444
>> That is not lady-like.

463
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,945
>> I slipped and got stuck!

464
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:05,529
>> I don't know what you were

465
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:06,530
doing.

466
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,573
I was bent over looking at the

467
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,157
ground and you jumped right on

468
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,658
top.

469
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,285
Your boobs popped out?

470
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:11,952
>> Maybe.

471
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,579
>> That's fitting.

472
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,747
I'm not the stereotypical

473
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,205
Mormon.

474
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,082
I respect the church and the

475
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,419
people in it, but for myself,

476
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,087
personally, you know, there's

477
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,756
things I want to do and not

478
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,174
necessarily that are sinning.

479
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:29,053
>> Oh, no!

480
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,013
>> We'll see what happens when

481
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,056
I get home and everyone disowns

482
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,307
me.

483
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,099
Okay, team, I got tired of the

484
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,601
rope.

485
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,270
>> Oh, yeah, look at that.

486
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,772
(laughing)

487
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:40,481
>> Debbie!

488
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,316
>> Oh, my God.

489
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,443
>> Debbie!

490
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:47,696
>> You'll never be able to have

491
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,030
children again.

492
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:51,241
>> I don't care.

493
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,159
I'll probably have to move

494
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,912
somewhere else, somewhere less

495
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,039
Mormony.

496
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:01,710
>> Make beans?

497
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,419
I've always seen two people do

498
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:02,586
it.

499
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,755
>> Sierra, we've got to do

500
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:05,798
chores by ourselves.

501
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:06,632
We can't all hold each other's

502
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:07,007
hands.

503
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:07,549
>> Don't talk to me like I'm

504
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,467
stupid.

505
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,301
>> I'm just saying it doesn't

506
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,135
take two people.

507
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,805
I was not being condescending.

508
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,307
>>> I'm pissed.

509
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,177
>> How many handfuls of beans

510
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,221
should I do?

511
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,973
>> PROBST: Sierra made a bad

512
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:56,974
first impression with her

513
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,767
Timbira tribemates, but by day

514
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,060
eight, her strength seemed to

515
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,729
be returning and Coach was

516
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,021
ready to put her to work.

517
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,356
>> Sierra, how about you cook

518
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:04,606
the beans?

519
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,734
>> Make fire and the beans?

520
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:07,901
>> You'd have only one person

521
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:08,360
doing it.

522
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,653
One person putting the firewood

523
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,864
on the fire, same person cooking

524
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,115
the beans, and nobody stomping

525
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,116
around.

526
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,200
>> I've always seen two people

527
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,161
do it.

528
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:17,745
>> That's why we're getting

529
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,705
stuff in our beans and our

530
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,247
rice because there are too

531
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,874
many people around there.

532
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,417
I'm watching the stuff fly up

533
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,835
in the air while stuff is

534
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,755
cooking.

535
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:28,881
Sierra, you put a log on the

536
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,758
fire, then put another log on

537
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,217
the fire, and then stir the

538
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,344
beans, and then wait.

539
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,387
>> Yeah, I understand.

540
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,930
>> Put another log on the fire.

541
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:37,890
It doesn't take two people.

542
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:38,682
>> Don't talk to me like I'm

543
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:38,932
stupid.

544
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:39,516
>> I'm just saying it doesn't

545
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,310
take two people.

546
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,353
>> Yeah, but it's nice to have

547
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,189
someone, like a female, like

548
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,524
tending the fire and then one's

549
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,859
cooking and then...

550
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:49,902
You know what I mean?

551
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:50,736
It's nice to...

552
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,112
>> Sierra, we've got to do

553
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,155
chores by ourselves.

554
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,323
We can't all hold each other's

555
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,199
hands, and for to you say that

556
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,325
you want somebody there to talk

557
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,243
to, I mean, there's a lot of

558
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:58,535
stuff to do.

559
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,828
>> Yeah.

560
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:00,370
>> You know, we got to...

561
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,497
>> I know and I've been part

562
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,581
of it since day one.

563
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:03,332
>> I know that, but I'm

564
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,833
just saying we got to start

565
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:05,417
doing stuff independently, as

566
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,668
well.

567
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,461
>> Okay, that's fine.

568
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,045
What are you guys going to be

569
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:08,629
doing while I'm doing that?

570
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:09,338
>> Fishing.

571
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,340
>> All of you are going to go

572
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,800
fishing?

573
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:13,550
>> We're going to take about

574
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,343
four of us down there and

575
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,177
see if we can just surround

576
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,304
them and fish.

577
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,183
>> Okay.

578
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,184
>> Is that going to stress you

579
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:22,351
out?

580
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,310
It looks like it's stressing

581
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,895
you out.

582
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:25,896
>> Why don't you talk to me from

583
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:26,522
over here, so you don't get dirt

584
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,189
in the beans?

585
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,232
(chuckling)

586
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,108
I'm one of the ones working the

587
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,276
hardest, so...

588
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,028
I'm really getting tired of

589
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:33,529
people like Coach saying

590
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,823
things, "You need to do this,"

591
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:36,365
and shaking their finger and

592
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,950
coming down on me.

593
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:38,867
They think they can 'cause

594
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:39,785
they think they're older than me

595
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:40,452
and they think they're more

596
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,703
knowledgeable.

597
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,247
Um, it's only going to make me

598
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:48,001
turn on them faster.

599
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,336
>> I can be very condescending,

600
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,505
but as a leader or just as a

601
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,506
person, that's not somebody

602
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,550
that I want to be.

603
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,843
I was not being condescending

604
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:56,218
towards Sierra.

605
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,846
I was actually just trying to

606
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,765
wean her from the (bleep),

607
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,100
so to speak.

608
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:03,892
I don't think she's going to

609
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:04,434
fully realize her potential

610
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,980
when people keep coddling her.

611
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:12,234
There's a bunch of big, juicy

612
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,778
ones up there.

613
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,116
>> Uh-huh.

614
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:21,618
>> It's been a bountiful tree,

615
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,202
hasn't it been?

616
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,289
>> Yeah.

617
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,332
>> Not very talkative.

618
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:31,545
>> I'm pissed.

619
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,838
>> So, you want me to tell you

620
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:33,964
why I was picking on you?

621
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:37,593
>> Yeah.

622
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,302
>> I was gently trying to push

623
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,762
you out of the nest.

624
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,014
And I just...

625
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,140
I wanted to see you like,

626
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,684
expand yourself because I know

627
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:46,226
you can.

628
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:46,977
>> Mm-hmm.

629
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,728
>> You know, there's this part

630
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:48,937
of your personality that is

631
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,647
very dependent and there's this

632
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,690
part of your personality that's

633
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:52,107
very independent.

634
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:52,858
>> That's true.

635
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:53,859
>> Same as me.

636
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,320
But you can never coast in

637
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,113
life, in this game, and you

638
00:19:58,196 --> 00:19:59,156
know that.

639
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,824
>> Now that I think about it

640
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,993
and start to, like, cool off,

641
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:03,952
I don't think Coach thinks I'm

642
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:04,536
stupid.

643
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,454
I think he has higher

644
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,788
expectations for me than he

645
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:07,873
does for other people.

646
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,207
He thinks of me as a strong

647
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:09,875
female.

648
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,335
You're going to be harder on

649
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,419
that one just so that they play

650
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,379
harder in a game.

651
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,547
And I think that's what...

652
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,007
where his mind's really at.

653
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,258
And I could very well be wrong,

654
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,676
but I think there's some good

655
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,761
intent behind it.

656
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,305
>> Thanks, Coach.

657
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,311
>> PROBST: Later that day, at

658
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,355
Jalapao, the muck and grime of

659
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,397
the game gave Sydney another

660
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,733
chance to prove her worth.

661
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:35,901
>> Look at this.

662
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,194
Is that a...

663
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,195
That is wild.

664
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,655
Nice.

665
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,280
Look at...

666
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:40,989
Looky here.

667
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:41,448
Birthmark there.

668
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,742
It is so dirty out here.

669
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:47,412
We live in ash, and it clings

670
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,455
to you.

671
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:52,042
>> Get away from me.

672
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,961
>> Every morning we get dirtier

673
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,921
and dirtier, so it's, um...

674
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:56,505
It's been kind of annoying for

675
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,173
us.

676
00:20:58,256 --> 00:20:59,883
I mean, I'm totally down for a

677
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,552
floor.

678
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,721
And that would solve all of our

679
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,140
problem with the soot, with the

680
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,266
palms.

681
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,936
J.T. has had the plan to lift

682
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,021
our shelter off the ground, and

683
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,231
it's a good idea.

684
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:14,773
You know, why not try it?

685
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,858
And I wanted to show him that

686
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,402
I'm behind him 100%, and let's

687
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,861
just do it.

688
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:20,696
Let's go.

689
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,824
This is going to be awesome.

690
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,325
>> I don't think I'm the leader

691
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:25,617
of Jalapao.

692
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,369
I've just always been one where

693
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,328
I'm ready to get something done,

694
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:28,704
I do it myself.

695
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,455
So, I'm not doing it just to be

696
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,916
the leader or do anybody else

697
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,417
any favors.

698
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,042
I'm doing it because I want to

699
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:34,584
get it done, and that's the

700
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,295
best way to do something.

701
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,422
>> Wow.

702
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,972
>> Can I contribute here?

703
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:53,270
Is there anything I can do here?

704
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,187
Tying?

705
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,439
Digging?

706
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:55,772
Posting?

707
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,110
>> Uh...

708
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:00,652
>> I did think Stephen was

709
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,238
somewhat nerdy when we started

710
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:04,197
out.

711
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,407
It feels like I have a little

712
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,159
brother or sidekick.

713
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,703
He's definitely a city boy.

714
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:10,829
>> I think we're kind of going

715
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,372
along as we go, but we could

716
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,417
definitely use your help, yeah.

717
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,593
I think J.T. holds the power

718
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,677
right now.

719
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,012
So I'm definitely trying to get

720
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,346
on his good side a little bit.

721
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,973
I think people have their first

722
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,350
impressions of me, and, you

723
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,894
know, and I always try to prove

724
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:34,853
that wrong.

725
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,063
I think we did a really good

726
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,981
job on... on, you know, getting

727
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:38,899
the floor off the ground.

728
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:39,649
I'll sleep better tonight.

729
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,735
That's for sure.

730

Brendan and Coach at Timbira,

734
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,665
and on day eight, they went

735
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:56,500
toe-to-toe to provide comfort

736
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,585
for the tribe.

737
00:22:58,668 --> 00:22:59,127

738
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,170
the seat...

739
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:00,712
>> Yes.

740
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:01,630
>> ...can you... any chance you

741
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,298
could put ropes in between it?

742
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:03,924
I think it's more comfortable...

743
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,592
>> I was actually going to put

744
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:06,218
three together.

745
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:06,927

together.

748

>> But it's got to be

749
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:10,305
comfortable this time.

750

751
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,015

the good...

00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,354
making your own personal seat.

00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:23,944
>> Give me some twine.

763
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,071
I'll undo the twine.

764
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,783
>> A bench-making contest?

765
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:30,700
>> Yes.

766
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,078
>> Ooh, I love to see the alpha

767
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:33,537
men go at it.

768
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,330
>> Coach is definitely a

769
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:36,248
character.

770
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,290
We're competing here and there

771
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,583
but to me, this is about having

772
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,376
a good time.

773
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,460
That's what we came out here to

774
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,670
do, and so any time, you know,

775
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,214
you're not, you should kind of

776
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:44,798
check yourself and be like,

777
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:47,551
let's do it.

778
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:55,433
>> Coach needs it more than I

779
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,601
do.

780
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,978
>> I've got longer rope.

781
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,312
Funky.

782
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,857
>> There is a very serious vying

783
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,607
for the spot of alpha male

784
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,235
contest happening right now.

785
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,194
I don't think it has anything to

786
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:06,778
do with benches or swings or

787
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,572
seats.

788
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:09,948
I think it's who can come out

789
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,366
on top, as usual.

790
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:11,992
>> Put your ass going in between

791
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,368
the two.

792
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:14,035
>> That's even worse.

793
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:14,536
>> Oh, please.

794
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,996
>> This is terrible, man!

795
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:16,913
>> Tearing the tribe apart,

796
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,540
guys.

797
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:19,082
>> The ladies will come over

798
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,041
and judge.

799
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,126
>> So we're having a bench-

800
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,294
building contest, which we love.

801
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,378
Because now we have more places

802
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:23,587
to sit.

803
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,129
>> Now we have more seats.

804
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:24,754
And what my idea is, like, let's

805
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,464
start having contests of who can

806
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,716
get the river water faster.

807
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,592
>> All the time, yeah.

808
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:29,634
>> Who can get the beans going

809
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,219
the fastest.

810
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,053
>> Who can collect the most

811
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:32,304
firewood?

812
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:33,847
We'll judge them all.

813
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,222
It will be great.

814
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,515
>> Oh, see, I can't leave that.

815
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,975
>> Oh, this is very comfortable!

816
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,060
(Tarzan yell)

817
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,020
>> I haven't sat on that one

818
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,646
yet.

819
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,189
>> That's definitely going

820
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,273
to be more comfortable.

821
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,274
>> Yeah, and we said that it

822
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:44,858
was only about comfort, man.

823
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:45,734
It was not about time.

824
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,069
It was not about people.

825
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:48,737
>> It was about taking care of

826
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:48,987
the tribe.

827
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,322
>> Yeah, I think I know where

828
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:50,739
Coach's button is.

829
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,908
>> We did not say it.

830
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,242
>> Coach, it's not about you.

831
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,285
It's about the tribe.

832
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,494
>> I know it's about the tribe.

833
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,329
Why do you think I wanted to

834
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:57,913
have a bench-building contest

835
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,915
in the first place?

836
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:00,665
>> This is the most fun I've had

837
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:00,957
in a while.

838
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,667
I'm an entrepreneur, so I

839
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,835
started a business.

840
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:04,961
When I think about business,

841
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,004
you know, every day, when you

842
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,172
build something from scratch,

843
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,089
interacting with people that

844
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,132
you've never met before is

845
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,051
something I adore.

846
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,093
You know, Coach tries to act

847
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,428
like a coach all the time.

848
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:14,221
We're not out here to have a

849
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:14,846
coach.

850
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,889
We don't need one.

851
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:16,765
You know, we're out here to have

852
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:17,682
friends; we're out here to work

853
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:18,600
with people.

854
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,517
>> 'Cause it will fall down

855
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,310
when you sit on it.

856
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,394
>> This is delicious.

857
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:21,645
Good job.

858
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:24,773
>> That was good.

859
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:31,196
>> PROBST: At Jalapao, Taj, used

860
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,073
to a high standard of living

861
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,783
back home, was having a hard

862
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,452
time adjusting to the elements.

863
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:38,370
>> Your back is really, really

864
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,372
bad.

865
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,499
>> Yeah.

866
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,461
I can't believe I look like

867
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:46,628
this.

868
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,713
I feel like a leper.

869
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,853
>> How are you feeling?

870
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,149
Are you all right?

871
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:08,692
>> No, I'm fine.

872
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,568
>> No, you can come on.

873
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,152
We're just... I'm chitchatting

874
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,362
with her, man.

875
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,113
I know she had a...

876
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,114
>> I can't look at myself.

877
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:14,698
>> I just feel so ugly.

878
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,574
>> It must have been really hard

879
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,826
last night.

880
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,995
>> Oh, God.

881
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,206
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

882
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:23,957
I'm sorry.

883
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,667
(sobbing)

884
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,003
>> I got a little emotional

885
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,170
because I just looked at

886
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,299
myself...

887
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,261
and I just had a moment

888
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,013
because I just... I don't know

889
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,597
what's going on.

890
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,809
My back is just destroyed.

891
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,020
And I still have to go home.

892
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,479
So I just don't want to go home

893
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,939
looking like a wreck.

894
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:48,940
>> One of the hardest things

895
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:49,691
you've ever done?

896
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:50,650
>> You know, it wasn't so much

897
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:51,735
hard.

898
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,987
I swear, I can handle this.

899
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,031
It's just the after-effect

900
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,032
looking at myself.

901
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,575
I'm just like, "Ew!"

902
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:00,243
What am I doing to myself?

903
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,870
What am I doing?

904
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,204
>> To my body, yeah.

905
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,497
>> I never felt so ugly before

906
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,750
in my life.

907
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:07,751
Stephen came down and he talked

908
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,878
to me and they made me feel

909
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,005
better, but...

910
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,230
I'm just having a moment.

911
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,482
Everyone has their moments out

912
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,150
here, and today is mine.

913
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,610
I'm just more determined now.

914
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,278
I cannot go home empty-handed

915
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:35,779
looking like this.

916
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,906
(laughs)

917
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,873
>> I thought I saw a snake

918
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,625
going through the rafters.

919
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,752
>> Oh, my gosh!

920
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,922
>> Oh!

921
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,176
>> Coach-- just the biggest joke

922
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:01,221
on the planet.

923
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,532
>> PROBST: After a restless

924
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,909
night of sleep, on morning ten,

925
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:23,952
Timbira was still making

926
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,870
discoveries about the dangers of

927
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,997
their environment.

928
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,669
>> I heard something about a

929
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:33,962
snake, too.

930
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:34,754
>> It was a nightmare, a

931
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,257
flashback from when I was on the

932
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:37,799
Amazon and a snake wrapped

933
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,176
around my neck.

934
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,344
I was having that nightmare

935
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,887
sometimes; it's reoccurring.

936
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:43,763
(indistinct audio)

937
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,432
>> That's okay.

938
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,558
I was just like, well...

939
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:47,517
>> It's one thing to have that

940
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,018
dream at home and talking in

941
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,812
your sleep, but when...

942
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:54,065
>> When it could happen here.

943
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,900
>> Last night, Coach woke up

944
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,902
and screamed, "Snake."

945
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,487
Well, we thought he was dreaming

946
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,489
and being silly or whatever.

947
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,490
Oh, my gosh!

948
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,408
Okay, has anybody else seen

949
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,367
this?

950
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:04,951
>> What?

951
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,327
>> That is a snake skin.

952
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,454
>> Oh, gross.

953
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,289
>> This wasn't here yesterday.

954
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,832
Oh, my gosh!

955
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,208
A snake has shed his skin

956
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,042
right here.

957
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,961
Brendan, come see what we found.

958
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,005
>> I told you I saw a snake in

959
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,423
there last night, man.

960
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:19,215
>> I thought you were you were

961
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,133
dreaming about it.

962
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,009
>> Maybe it wasn't a dream.

963
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,136
>> Oh, my God!

964
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,137
>> I swear, man, I looked up

965
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,346
and I thought I saw a snake

966
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,598
going through the rafters.

967
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:27,056
>> Really?

968
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:27,515
>> I'm not kidding.

969
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,641
But then I thought it was my

970
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:29,684
reoccurring dream of being in

971
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:29,976
the Amazon.

972
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,519
>> They're not going to just

973
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,353
come up and bite us while we're

974
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,354
sleeping, would they?

975
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,022
>> They could.

976
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,941
>> Okay, this is really freaky.

977
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,443
We really got to be careful

978
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:39,611
out here.

979
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,738
This place is infested with

980
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:42,906
snakes, with nasty, poisonous

981
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,324
snakes.

982
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,409
So I'm being very careful as to

983
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,660
where I step.

984
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:48,745
>> Hey, we're in the wild.

985
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,288
That's what happens.

986
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:53,124
We're part of their environment.

987
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,753
>> That just really bums me out.

988
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:09,891
>> PROBST: While over at

989
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,018
Jalapao...

990
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,688
...J.T. and Joe enjoyed some

991
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:16,189
good, sporting fun.

992
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:17,482
Though it didn't stop Joe from

993
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,609
thinking about the game.

994
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,612
>> A little jatoba ball.

995
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,080
>> Oh!

996
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:32,956
Right now, it's probably J.T.

997
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,958
leading Jalapao.

998
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,960
And I don't think there's a lot

999
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,920
of tension between J.T.

1000
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,673
and I right now.

1001
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:42,215
>> Oh!

1002
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:44,342
You brought the heat.

1003
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,555
>> It's kind of nice to have

1004
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:49,138
somebody you can just let take

1005
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,890
over and then also, you know,

1006
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,016
the spotlight isn't on you.

1007
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,059
>> Take a little saliva off

1008
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,602
that ball.

1009
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,729
Maybe it will fly straight.

1010
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,612
>> That's at least a triple.

1011
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,905
>> My kind of ace in the hole,

1012
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,240
as compared to J.T.,

1013
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,783
is going to be my strategy and

1014
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:10,535
kind of my social game moving

1015
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:11,035
forward.

1016
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,162
>> All right, here you go.

1017
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:18,960
Single.

1018
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,920
>> Is that all?

1019
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:21,296
>> That was it.

1020
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,548
He's more of the basic just

1021
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:26,050
kind of provider, you know,

1022
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,094
kind of just alpha male type of

1023
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,262
guy.

1024
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,639
>> A little fungo.

1025
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,766
>> Oh!

1026
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:39,022
Oh, dude. Ow.

1027
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,148
>> Right back at ya.

1028
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,899
You tried to get me off the

1029
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,610
plate.

1030
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,737
My bad.

1031
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,617
>> Oh, that's gone.

1032
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,497
>> What in the hell?

1033
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,208
>> I'd imagine that as we go

1034
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,501
further on in the game, it will

1035
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,587
get a little tense, and, you

1036
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:03,963
know, that's something that I'm

1037
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:04,297
prepared for.

1038
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,674
I know that's going to happen.

1039
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,884
>> We better quit or we'll lose

1040
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,052
an eye.

1041
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:12,180
>> I think I won, dude.

1042
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:18,561
(sighs)

1043
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,733
>> PROBST: After two visits to

1044
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,401
Tribal Council, spirits were

1045
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,695
down at Timbira, so Coach called

1046
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:28,321
upon his conducting skills to

1047
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,114
orchestrate some smiles.

1048
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,032
>> Tonight we're gonna play

1049
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,660
Peter Tchaikovsky's "March

1050
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:36,371
Slav," and it goes like this.

1051
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:36,579
>> Okay.

1052
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:39,248
(humming lively melody)

1053
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,001
(voice deepens, continues

1054
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,128
singing)

1055
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,217
And then I cue the strings.

1056
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,552
Ready and...

1057
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,805
(singing minor-key melody)

1058
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,515
And that means I want a little

1059
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:56,766
crescendo and then a

1060
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:57,934
decrescendo.

1061
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:01,062
(continues minor-key melody)

1062
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:12,156
(continues singing melody)

1063
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,952
>> Who is this jackass?

1064
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:19,038
(singing melody)

1065
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,541
Coach-- just the biggest

1066
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,875
joke on the planet.

1067
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,335
Like, I'm in a weird position

1068
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,128
because I don't really like my

1069
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,630
tribe all that much.

1070
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,590
And I don't have the alliances

1071
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,342
out here, but I think it would

1072
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,635
be kind of fun to pretend for a

1073
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,219
while, like, "We are one big

1074
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:34,137
happy family!

1075
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,263
We're in love.

1076
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,474
Everything's great."

1077
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:39,976
You know, every time I get a

1078
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:40,601
couple more days out here, it's

1079
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,895
that much closer to a merge.

1080
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,355
If I can make it that far, it'll

1081
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,148
be interesting to see how it

1082
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,817
plays out.

1083
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,193
(whooping)

1084
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,320
>> Bravo! Bravo!

1085
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,326
(wind whistling)

1086
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,036
(thunder rumbling)

1087
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,538
>> I have never been so close to

1088
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,290
another man.

1089
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,249
What is that?

1090
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,042
>> You're solid, right?

1091
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:05,626
>> Yes, dude.

1092
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,003
>> I'll never vote you out.

1093
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,379
>> I don't perceive him as being

1094
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,798
near the player that I am.

1095
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,382
>> We have two immunity idols.

1096
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,258
We have the control.

1097
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,260
>> But is he entirely

1098
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:14,552
trustworthy?

1099
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,512
(thunder rumbles)

1100
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,639
Maybe he's not.

1101
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,995
>> PROBST: On day 13, Coach and

1102
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:42,371
Tyson took advantage of an early

1103
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,790
morning walk to make some

1104
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,917
long-term plans.

1105
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,177
I think that, uh, we get rid of

1106
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,970
Erinn 'cause she's a cancer.

1107
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:58,888
>> Here's the thing.

1108
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,223
We can use... we can use Erinn

1109
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,349
for a few votes.

1110
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,725
She'll stick with us for that

1111
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:03,392
long.

1112
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,811
>> Oh, no. I hate doing that.

1113
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:05,394
I hate doing that, and I don't

1114
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:06,896
trust her.

1115
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:07,814
A lot of people don't want to

1116
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:08,815
talk about who's gonna be

1117
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:09,440
eliminated.

1118
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,733
Tyson and I-- we're thinking

1119
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:11,484
about it every day.

1120
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:11,692
>> Yeah.

1121
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,152
>> I'm gonna tell you this.

1122
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,445
I told you from the first day,

1123
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,530
I'll never vote you out.

1124
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:15,738
>> Yeah.

1125
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,114
>> And I'm telling you right

1126
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,241
now, man to man, I'll never go

1127
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:18,574
back on that.

1128
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:19,992
>> Yeah, me, neither.

1129
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:20,576
>> Like I told you, you're the

1130
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,495
most popular guy in this tribe.

1131
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:23,830
You'll be the most popular guy

1132
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:24,497
in this game.

1133
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,581
I ruffle people's feathers.

1134
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,874
You know, that's just me.

1135
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:27,625
>> Yeah.

1137
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:29,752
do, and everybody laughs.

1138
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:30,920
I say what you say, and

1139
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,421
everybody's, like, "Whoa!

1140
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,216
That was wrong."

1141
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,926

1142
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:37,844
let you know that.

1143
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,972
>> Yeah. I'm the same way.

1144
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,280
>> Okay.

1145
00:35:57,363 --> 00:36:01,200
Coach. He's the coach, you know?

1146
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,911
Right now I'm mostly agreeing

1147
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,079
with what he says.

1148
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,498
But in this game, I... don't

1149
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,042
perceive him as being near the

1150
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:13,045

river at Jalapao, J.T. and

1154
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,929
Stephen were also discussing the

1155
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:22,430
future of the game.

1159
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,393
There are four of us;

1160
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:28,311
we could find two of them.

around.

1163
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,355
I mean, he's just from such a

1164
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,523
different part of the world, and

1165
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,900
it's hard to imagine we'd ever

1166
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:34,400

But I know we'll always be

friends now.

1169
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,529
I think you should lay 'em there

1170
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:39,947
and go down there and check it

1171
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:40,448

He is the likeable Everyman with

1176

the sweet Southern drawl and the

1177
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,415
charming smile.

1178
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,833

of his sidekick, but is J.T.

1184
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,426
entirely trustworthy?

1185
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,385
Maybe he's not.

1186
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,345
I mean, you're solid, right?

1187
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,013
>> Yes, dude.

1188
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,056
>> Yeah, okay, me, too.

1189
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:05,973
>> No doubt.

1190
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,184
I'm solid with you.

1191
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,810
And then we go to the merge,

1192
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:10,394
then we start looking towards

1193
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,688
the final... final three.

1194
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:13,689

you.

You win, you take me?

1198
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,279
We go to final two.

1199
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,573

as our tribe leader, and, um, I

1202
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,870
hope to put myself into a power

1203
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:28,621
position.

1204
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,830
But I'm not the strongest

1205
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,831
physical competitor, and so I

1206
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,583
need to be with J.T. as much as

1207
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:32,833
possible.

1208
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:33,501
Things are definitely improving

1209
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,586
for me in this game, but I know

1210
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,921
better than to, you know, say

1211
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,048
that with certainty.

piece of his Exile alliance with

1217

>> Oh, that's kind of

1221
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,487
disgusting, actually.

1222
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,571
How tall?

1223
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:03,364
What, three, four feet?

1224
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,408
>> Yeah, and there's some that

1225
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:05,866
fell off down there.

1226
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,034
>> Oh, man.

1227
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:07,326
>> Here.

1228
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,036
It'll be a good boa for you.

1229
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,037
>> A little, uh, a little

1230
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:10,371
decoration?

1231
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:10,705
Oh, thank you.

1232
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,039
>> There you go.

1233
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:12,999
>> I feel pretty, finally.

1234
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:13,624
>> When I came out to Exile this

1235
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:14,500
time, um, I wanted Stephen's

1236
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,502
trust.

1237
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:17,420
I think Stephen didn't

1238
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,630
necessarily believe all this was

1239
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,090
going on, didn't know me, didn't

1240
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,466
know Sierra, and so I think it's

1241
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,926
important that the four of us

1242
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,052
trust each other and know that

1243
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,303
we're going to the finals

1244
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,888
together.

1245
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:28,431
Are you guys solid in your

1246
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:29,557
tribe?

1247
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,891
Like, there's no fear of you

1248
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:31,434
getting eliminated?

1249
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:32,518
>> I don't think so.

1250
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:33,728
I mean, we thought Erinn might

1251
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:34,520
be on the outs.

1252
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:34,729
>> Yeah.

1253
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,273
I needed to be very honest with

1254
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,482
him, and so I tried to tell him

1255
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,567
as much as could about my tribe,

1256
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,527
about how we could work

1257
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,445
together, just to make him feel

1258
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:45,281
comfortable with that alliance.

1259
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,323
All right, you ready?

1260
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,450
>> Mm-hmm.

1261
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,624
Damn, you're quite the woodman.

1262
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:05,051
(thunder rumbling)

1263
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,552
>> Oh, come on, dude.

1264
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:10,056
Who's doing this?

1265
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,183
>> Oh, no!

1266
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,645
>> (laughs): Are you serious?

1267
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:19,774
(thunder rumbling)

1268
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,871
I have never been so close to

1269
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:34,705
another man.

1270
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,957
He and I spooned for all we were

1271
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,959
worth.

1272
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,503
Oh, my God, it was raining.

1273
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:41,378
It was cold.

1274
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,172
Nothing could prepare me for

1275
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:46,217
lying huddled against, you know,

1276
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,595
a hunk of-of man.

1277
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:51,722
(thunder rumbles)

1278
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:03,526
>> I'm exhausted. I'm...

1279
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,403
>> Um, the night Steve and I had

1280
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,280
out here on Exile was probably

1281
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:08,906
the worst night I've had, and so

1282
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,242
we huddled up and spooned all

1283
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:11,826
night and had a great bonding

1284
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,285
experience.

1285
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,495
Another 20 minutes?

1286
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,372
What do we got here?

1287
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,790
>> It's actually coming over the

1288
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:20,584
mountain, a little bit.

1289
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,128
>> Ah, there it is.

1290
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,337
>> Ah, feels good, doesn't it?

1291
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:23,796
>> Yeah.

1292
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,548
And that's the one really cool

1293
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,091
thing about Exile: it's just a

1294
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,843
bonding experience far greater

1295
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:29,927
than what... than could happen

1296
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,011
back at our tribes.

1297
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:31,637
Look how long our shadows are.

1298
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,181
>> Oh, God.

1299
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,850
>> Uh... what kind of shapes

1300
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:36,475
can you make?

1301
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,227
(laughs)

1302
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,146
>> What I<i> love</i> about our group

1303
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:40,646
is we have a four-person

1304
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:43,232
alliance: you have myself;

1305
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,275
you have Sierra;

1306
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,609
you have Taj and Stephen;

1307
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:46,652
and we're all, like,

1308
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:47,945
it's, like, it's kind of a

1309
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:48,237
motley crew.

1310
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,281
We have two immunity idols.

1311
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:51,490
We have the control, and, you

1312
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:52,950
know, hopefully, it'll be

1313
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,034
smooth sailing from there.

1314
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,036
Can you make a... I guess, a

1315
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:56,745
"T"?

1316
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,706
>> A cross, yeah.

1317
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,666
>> "H."

1318
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:01,500
Sort of.

1319
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,836
>> I've just met Brendan.

1320
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,337
We've bonded because we have...

1321
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:05,880
we have spooned quite a bit.

1322
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,424
And I'm glad right now that I'm

1323
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:09,425
in his alliance.

1324
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,010
But there's a lot that's going

1325
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:11,635
on in my tribe right now, and my

1326
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,929
priority has to be to make sure

1327
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,389
that I get to the merge in a

1328
00:41:15,472 --> 00:41:15,806
really strong place.

1329
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,975
>> No more cuddling once we get

1330
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:20,769
back to the merge tribe, yeah.

1331
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,146
>> Much as I would love to.

1332
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:23,689
(laughs): Yeah.

1333
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,487
>> PROBST: 11 castaways are

1334
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,197
left.

1335
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,615
Of the first five votes,

1336
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:35,451
three have been blindsides.

1337
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:35,993
What will happen when the

1338
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:39,496
challenges get more intense...

1339
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,790
the rewards bigger...

1340
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:42,708
the stakes higher?

1341
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:43,918
>> You are such a liar!

1342
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,377
>> PROBST: Will friendships and

1343
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,545
alliances that formed early

1344
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:47,588
continue through the game?

1345
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,216
And what twists await?

1346
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:50,674
(yelling)

1347
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,636
>> PROBST: Join us next time...

1348
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:58,349
as the adventure continues.

1349
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:00,476
(bird screeches)

1350
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,773
Stay tuned for scenes from our

1351
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,900
next episode.

1352
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,029
>> PROBST: Next time on

1353
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:15,366
<i>Survivor:</i>

1354
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:16,909
Timbira turns on Coach.

1355
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,160
>> We all were frustrated with

1356
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:18,786
Coach.

1357
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:19,662
>> And the truth shall set you

1358
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,163
free!

1359
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,331
>> PROBST: And at Jalapao...

1360
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:22,831
>> We're going to merge.

1361
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,625
>> We're going to the end.

1362
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,085
>> PROBST: ...the tribe turns on

1363
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:28,045
each other.

1364
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,338
>> It's terrible.

1365
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:31,382
I'm going to hell.

1366
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,638
>> Remember when you kind of...

1367
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:38,931
>> Yeah.

1368
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:39,848
>> ...when you wouldn't stop?

1369
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,642
>> Yeah, I remember.

1370
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,270
When can we do it again?

1371
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:45,312
>> You'd probably have to give

1372
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:45,813
me, like, ten minutes or

1373
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:46,981
something.

1374
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:47,606
>> Ten minutes in between?

1375
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,316
>> Yep.

1376
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,150
>> You're a stud.

1377
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:50,818
>> I know.

1378
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,611
I can go all night.

1379
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:56,323
(laughs)
