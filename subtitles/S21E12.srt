1
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:04,045
>> Jeff:
PREVIOUSLY ON<i> SURVIVOR,</i>

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:05,588
DURING THE PAST FOUR WEEKS,

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:09,968
THESE CASTAWAYS
HAVE ENDURED SEVERE STORMS

4
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,595
THAT NEARLY WASHED
AWAY THEIR CAMP.

5
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,932
>> HAVING THREE NIGHTS
OF HORRIBLE RAIN IS MISERABLE.

6
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:19,269
>> Jeff: AND AN ACCIDENTAL FIRE
THAT BURNED UP THEIR FOOD.

7
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:22,105
>> OH MY GOD!

8
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,273
>> Jeff: A MONTH IN NICARAGUA

9
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,150
HAD MADE ONE THING CLEAR--

10
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:27,152
THIS IS NO PLACE FOR THE WEAK.

11
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:30,947
BACK ON DAY FIVE,

12
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,323
HOLLY MELTED DOWN
AND WANTED TO QUIT.

13
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,284
>> I CAN'T DO IT.

14
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,618
>> Jeff: BUT AFTER A PEP TALK

15
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,828
FROM COACH JIMMIE JOHNSON...

16
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:38,246
>> WE REALLY DO NEED YOU.

17
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,415
>> Jeff: ...SHE STAGED
A COMPLETE TURNAROUND

18
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:43,501
AND FORGED A STRONG ALLIANCE
WITH CHASE AND JANE.

19
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,795
>> ONE LESSON
I'VE LEARNED OUT HERE

20
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,255
IS QUITTING IS AN EASY WAY OUT.

21
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,298
YOU SIGNED UP FOR SOMETHING.

22
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,092
SUCK IT UP AND FINISH.

23
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,802
>> Jeff: ON DAY 13,

24
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,764
RAIN AND BITTER COLD
MADE NAONKA WANT TO BAIL,

25
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,265
BUT KIND WORDS FROM CHASE
WARMED HER UP

26
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,309
AND KEPT HER IN THE GAME.

27
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,351
>> WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

28
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,436
WE'LL MAKE IT THROUGH THIS.

29
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,854
THIS AIN'T NOTHING.

30
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:05,190
>> Jeff: ON DAY 15,

31
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,149
PURPLE KELLY HIT THE WALL.

32
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,318
>> I HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN,
LIKE, WARM.

33
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,278
LIKE EVERY NIGHT
HAS BEEN FREEZING.

34
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,155
IT'S KILLING ME OUT HERE.

35
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,281
I JUST WANT TO QUIT.

36
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,824
>> Jeff: BUT SHE STAYED

37
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,451
BECAUSE HE WAS BLINDLY OBEDIENT

38
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,285
TO TRIBE LEADERS BRENDA
AND SASH.

39
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,204
>> WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT,

40
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:25,043
IT'S REALLY WHATEVER SASH
AND I WANT.

41
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,253
>> Jeff: AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL,

42
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,506
HOLLY AND JANE LED A CONSPIRACY

43
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,007
TO TAKE BRENDA OUT.

44
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,177
SO SHE TRIED TO DIVERT ATTENTION
TO NAONKA.

45
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,845
>> IT WAS NAONKA WANTING
TO JUMP SHIP.

46
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,348
>> Jeff: BRENDA'S
LONG-TIME ALLY, SASH,

47
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,557
COULD HAVE SAVED HER

48
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,392
IF HE COUGHED UP
HIS HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

49
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:44,312
IF ANYBODY HAS THE IMMUNITY IDOL
AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

50
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,523
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

51
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,191
BUT HE DIDN'T.

52
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,193
11th PERSON VOTED OUT,

53
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,319
AND THE THIRD MEMBER
OF OUR JURY, BRENDA.

54
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,738
>> BRENDA WAS VOTED OUT

55
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,532
AND PURPLE KELLY
WAS THE ONLY ONE

56
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,783
WHO DIDN'T SEE IT COMING.

57
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:57,867
NINE ARE LEFT,

58
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,953
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

59
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,257
>> I CAN'T SEE A THING.

60
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,175
I'M HITTING A BRANCH.

61
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,553
>> IT'S A LITTLE FURTHER.

62
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,720
>> SASH.

63
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:18,847
>> THANKS, BUDDY.

64
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,931
>> YEP.

65
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,182
>> TONIGHT WAS WILD.

66
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,600
>> IT WAS TOO WILD.

67
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,185
>> LIKE, I DON'T...

68
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,562
I DON'T UNDERSTAND AT ALL

69
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,563
WHAT IS GOING ON.

70
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,605
>> I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT...

71
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,898
>> WHO DID YOU END UP
VOTING FOR?

72
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:29,899
>> BRENDA.

73
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,025
>> OH, YOU DID?

74
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,027
>> YEAH, DID YOU HEAR
ALL SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT ME?

75
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,696
>> SHE REALLY CALLED YOU
OUT ON EVERYTHING.

76
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:38,074
BRENDA LEAVING THE GAME, LIKE,
COMPLETELY SCREWED ME OVER.

77
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:40,243
I WAS JUST COMPLETELY LEFT
IN THE DARK,

78
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,911
AND IT'S, LIKE,

79
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,371
THANK GOD I HAVEN'T BEEN LEFT
IN THE DARK FOR 28 DAYS

80
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:46,916
BECAUSE I'D BE GOING... NUTS.

81
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,711
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT TO EXPECT FROM HERE ON OUT.

82
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,463
HAVING NAONKA, CHASE,
AND SASH TURN ON ME

83
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,508
PUT ME AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE TOTEM POLE

84
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,468
OF ANY ALLIANCE
I WERE TO BE A PART OF.

85
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,555
>> SO I FEEL WE SENT THE RIGHT
PERSON HOME TONIGHT.

86
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:01,764
>> YEAH, ME, TOO.

87
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,266
>> I THINK WHAT SHE SAW

88
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,976
IS THAT YOU HAD FLIPPED,

89
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,270
AND SHE KNEW YOU WERE
GETTING INFORMATION OUT OF HER

90
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,938
AND COMING BACK AND TELLING US.

91
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:09,939
>> UH-HUH.

92
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:10,982
>> BUT THAT MAKES ME
TRUST YOU MORE.

93
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,108
>> RIGHT.

94
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,401
>> WHEN YOU TELL ME STUFF
LIKE THAT.

95
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,194
SO DON'T THINK IT'S GOING
TO WORK AGAINST YOU.

96
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,112
>> OKAY.

97
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,114
TONIGHT AT TRIBAL,
BRENDA SHOWED HER ASS.

98
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,074
SHE LITERALLY THREW ME
UNDER THE BUS

99
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,243
AND RAN OVER ME FORWARD
AND BACKWARDS

100
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,329
AND THEN HAD THE NERVE
TO WRITE MY NAME DOWN.

101
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,622
>> SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

102
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,749
>> OKAY. DO I LOOK LIKE
BOO BOO THE FOOL?

103
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,792
YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE
MAKING ME LOOK BAD?

104
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,170
BITCH, YOU MADE ME LOOK GOOD.

105
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,338
>> I AIN'T GONNA WORRY.

106
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,506
WHAT BRENDA SAID
ABOUT YOU TONIGHT

107
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,008
WAS IN ONE EAR
AND OUT THE OTHER.

108
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,009
>> OKAY.

109
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,010
>> SO DON'T PANIC.

110
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,053
>> ALL RIGHT.

111
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:40,720
AND I'M NOT AFRAID OF NOTHING.

112
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,471
NOBODY INTIMIDATES ME HERE.

113
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,765
IF ANYTHING I INTIMIDATE THEM

114
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,767
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID
OF THE WORDS THAT I'LL USE

115
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,268
WHEN I GO OFF ON THEM.

116
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,686
WHATEVER, SHE'S GONE.

117
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,438
>> SO, AT THIS POINT, I MEAN,

118
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:53,358
IF YOU, ME, HOLLY AND JANE
STICK TOGETHER...

119
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,776
>> YEAH, WE HAVE TO.

120
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:58,321
>> SO, TWO PEOPLE ON THE OUTS
IS PURPLE AND SASH.

121
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,614
>> YEAH.

122
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:00,365
>> THE PROBLEM IS GONNA BE
GETTING OUT SASH,

123
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,492
'CAUSE HE HAS AN IDOL.

124
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,160
>> SO YOU JUST BLINDSIDE HIM.

125
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:06,371
>> NOW MY FOUR ALLIANCE

126
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:10,041
IS HOLLY, JANE, AND NAONKA.

127
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,502
AND HOPEFULLY,
I GO THROUGH SASH,

128
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:13,670
PURPLE KELLY AND FABIO,

129
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,965
BUT THIS GAME AIN'T SEEMED
TO WORK LIKE THAT SO FAR,

130
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,092
SO I'M EXPECTING SOMETHING
TO CHANGE, I'M SURE.

131
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,653
>> OH, MY GOD!

132
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:21,446
>> LOOK AT THAT, BRO.

133
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,365
>> LOOK AT THAT MUD.

134
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,908
>> IT'S CRAZY.

135
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,411
>> WE WOKE UP

136
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,079
AND RAIN HAD SET IN.

137
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,415
I MEAN, IT'S JUST A DELUGE.

138
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,584
>> OH, MY GOD.

139
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,128
>> AND WHAT WAS
OUR NICE LITTLE POND

140
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,589
IS NOW A RAGING RIVER.

141
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,924
>> SEE THAT BIG LOG GOING DOWN?

142
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,676
>> IT'S LIKE CLASS-3 RAPIDS.

143
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,765
>> HOPEFULLY,
THIS IS GOING TO LET UP

144
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,934
BECAUSE THIS MAKES
CAMP LIFE MISERABLE.

145
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,484
>> THIS IS INSANE.

146
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,947
AS IT RAINS AND IT POURS,

147
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:05,656
IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE CRAP.

148
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,743
I AM ANEMIC, SO WHEN I GET COLD,

149
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,954
MY JOINTS,
THEY GET STUCK AND THEY HURT.

150
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:12,455
THEY, LIKE, THEY FREEZE.

151
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:16,125
IT HURTS.

152
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,960
IT'S THE END OF THE GAME,

153
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,339
AND I'M-- I'M JUST TRYING,

154
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,548
I'M TRYING, I'M TRYING.

155
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,301
>> THERE'S NO WAY
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND

156
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,803
WHAT YOU GO THROUGH OUT HERE.

157
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,431
>> HERE IT COMES, BABY.

158
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:34,811
>> THERE'S JUST ONLY
SO MUCH I CAN DO.

159
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,605
I KEEP TRYING TO TELL MYSELF

160
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,316
ANYTHING I CAN JUST
TO STAY IN THE GAME,

161
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,819
JUST GET THROUGH IT DAY BY DAY.

162
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,655
I JUST DON'T KNOW,
LIKE, PHYSICALLY,

163
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,949
HOW MUCH LONGER
I CAN PUT UP WITH THIS.

164
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,700
>> IT'S REALLY AFFECTING YOU,
HUH?

165
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,495
>> IT'S JUST, LIKE, WEIRD, TOO,

166
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:57,041
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I NEVER FELT
ANYTHING LIKE THIS, YOU KNOW.

167
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,127
>> YEAH.

168
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,628
>> AND I DON'T WANT TO JUST,
LIKE, GIVE UP.

169
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,713
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

170
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,549
IT'S, LIKE,
HOW MUCH CAN I REALLY TAKE?

171
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,009
IT'S LIKE I MADE IT SO FAR

172
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,512
AND I JUST WANT TO, LIKE,
TRY AND STICK IN THERE,

173
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,680
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

174
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:15,309
>> THE ELEMENTS ARE DEFINITELY
A FACTOR OUT HERE.

175
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,812
I MEAN, SOMETIMES IT WILL RAIN

176
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,856
FOR FOUR OR FIVE HOURS,
YOU KNOW.

177
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:20,523
OUR TARP WAS OBVIOUSLY BURNED.

178
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,775
IT WAS COMING IN THE FRONT.

179
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:23,901
IT WAS COLD.

180
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,820
YOU JUST HAVE TO,
YOU HAVE TO, LIKE,

181
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:26,863
FIND A MENTAL HAPPY PLACE

182
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,532
AND YOU'VE JUST GOT TO SAY,
"THIS IS TEMPORARY.

183
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,700
I CAN DEAL WITH IT."

184
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,201
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU GUYS?

185
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,703
THIS IS ALL GOING TO MAKE US
STRONGER PEOPLE.

186
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,830
>> I KNOW.

187
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:36,914
>> YOU OKAY, NAY?

188
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,958
>> MY ASS HURTS.

189
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,962
>> OH, BABY!

190
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,394
>> FRANKLY, YOU KNOW,

191
00:07:58,477 --> 00:07:58,895
I DON'T REALLY CARE.

192
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,105
I'D LOVE FOR NAONKA

193
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,398
AND PURPLE KELLY TO WALK OUT.

194
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:03,399
>> YEAH, ME, TOO.

195
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:06,068
IT LOOKS LIKE WE COULD
BE LOSING A COUPLE.

196
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,612
AND I'M SITTING BACK, LIKE, HEY,

197
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,447
WE'RE IN THE FREAKING
RAIN FOREST.

198
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,698
I MEAN, COME ON, YOU KNOW.

199
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:11,908
FOUR HOURS OF RAIN,

200
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,742
AND YOU'RE GOING TO QUIT
THAT EASILY.

201
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,952
YOU DON'T BELONG HERE.

202
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,038
SO, YOU KNOW,
GO AHEAD AND PACK YOUR BAGS

203
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,956
AND GET OUT, FOR ALL I CARE.

204
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,834
>> WHAT'S GOING ON?

205
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:22,960
YOU SAID YOU WERE READY TO QUIT.

206
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,587
>> WELL,

207
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,714
YOU ALREADY KNOW
SINCE THE SWITCH HAPPENED,

208
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:29,258
HOW I WAS FEEL WITH THE WEATHER

209
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:29,926
AND I WANTED TO LEAVE.

210
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,636
BUT YOU TALKED ME OUT OF IT,

211
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,096
AND YOU WAS LIKE,
YOU GOTTA STAY.

212
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,097
WE SAID OUR PRAYERS.

213
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,390
WE DID ALL OF THAT.

214
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,601
MY HEART'S NOT IN THE GAME

215
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,602
LIKE IT SHOULD BE.

216
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:39,936
AND I'VE HAD THIS KEY FOREVER.

217
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,146
>> I KNOW.

218
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,898
>> YOU KNOW,
AND I'M GOING TO GIVE IT TO YOU

219
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,274
BECAUSE YOU'RE MY BOY.

220
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,901
I WOULDN'T GIVE IT
TO NOBODY ELSE.

221
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:50,279
SO, ANYWAY, I'M GOING
TO GIVE YOU THE KEY TO THE GAME.

222
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,074
THERE'S THE IDOL.

223
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,785
>> THAT'S THE FIRST TIME
I'VE SEEN IT.

224
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,787
>> YEAH?

225
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,038
>> YEAH.

226
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,331
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET.

227
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,333
I KNEW IT WAS A KEY,
BUT I AIN'T SEEN IT.

228
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,000
>> YEAH.

229
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,627
>> WELL, JUST KNOW, I MEAN,

230
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,962
I APPRECIATE THE HELL
OUT OF THIS.

231
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,422
NAONKA GAVE ME IDOL

232
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,132
BECAUSE SHE THINKS
I CAN DO WELL WITH IT, I GUESS,

233
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,135
AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL
HELP ME OUT IN THE LONG RUN.

234
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,971
>> YOU JUST GOT
TO WORK YOUR MAGIC.

235
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,806
NOW YOU GOT
TO TURN YOUR SWAG ON.

236
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,474
>> IF NAONKA DOESN'T QUIT,

237
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:20,142
THEN I'M STILL NOT GOING
TO GIVE HER THE IDOL BACK.

238
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,477
>> DON'T GET SCATTER BRAINED.

239
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,479
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

240
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:28,818
>> YOU AND I AND SASH AND CHASE
NEED TO STICK TOGETHER.

241
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:29,860
>> OH, HELL, YEAH.

242
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,487
>> YEAH, TOP FOUR, BABY.

243
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,446
THAT'S A NO-BRAINER.

244
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,865
>> BECAUSE IF KELLY DECIDES
TO STAY IN...

245
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:35,950
>> NO, SHE'S GOING THROUGH...

246
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:39,161
>> SHE MIGHT CHANGE HER MIND
AFTER SHE GETS WARM.

247
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,164
BUT SEE, RIGHT NOW,

248
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,125
I THINK SASH IS GOING
TO STAY WITH US,

249
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:44,834
BUT THEN YOU'VE GOT DANNY...

250
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,378
>> THERE'S THREE OF THEM.

251
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,170
>> THERE'S ONLY THREE OF THEM?

252
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,798
>> YEAH, DANNY, BENRY,
AND FABIO.

253
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,301
>> OH, OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

254
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,679
IF PURPLE KELLY AND NAONKA
DECIDE TO LEAVE,

255
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,889
I THINK WE STILL HAVE
A FOUR-WAY ALLIANCE

256
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:04,437
BETWEEN SASH, HOLLY,
CHASE AND ME,

257
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,023
SO THAT ONLY LEAVES
THE OTHER THREE PEOPLE

258
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:07,857
ON THEIR OWN,

259
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,026
AND IF WE KEEP FOUR STRONG,

260
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,736
WE CAN VOTE THEM OUT.

261
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,363
>> HERE'S MY THING.

262
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:14,864
US THREE AND JANE.

263
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:15,865
>> RIGHT.

264
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:16,866
>> YEAH

265
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:17,908
>> THIS IS NO...

266
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:18,909
I'M NOT FLOPPING.

267
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,037
>> YOU DON'T... YOU CAN'T!

268
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,038
>> OBVIOUSLY NOT.

269
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,372
I'D BE STUPID TO.

270
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,540
>> BECAUSE YOU LEARNED
FROM THE FIRST TIME.

271
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:25,875
LOOK IF YOU HAD FLOPPED
WITH BRENDA,

272
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,376
YOU'D BE THE NEXT ONE TO GO.

273
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,502
>> I KNOW.

274
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:32,882
I DO NOT TRUST CHASE,
HOLLY AND JANE

275
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,217
AS MUCH AS I DO PURPLE KELLY
AND NAONKA

276
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,844
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE TWO

277
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,055
THAT I'M CLOSEST WITH
AT LIBERTAD.

278
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:44,018
SO THE PERSON THAT DOES NOT
BENEFIT THE MOST IS ME.

279
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,062
IT CROSSED MY MIND TO TEAM UP

280
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,105
WITH BENRY, FABIO, AND DAN,

281
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,650
BUT I ABSOLUTE WISH NAONKA
AND PURPLE KELLY WOULD STAY.

282
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,465
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

283
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,892
GUYS READY TO GET
TO TODAY'S REWARD CHALLENGE?

284
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:25,893
>> YES.

285
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,186
>> OH, YEAH.

286
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,521
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT,
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE,

287
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,439
YOU WILL BE DIVIDED
INTO TWO TEAMS.

288
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,274
YOU'LL BE TETHERED TOGETHER.

289
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,568
EACH TEAM WILL HAVE

290
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,905
AN EIGHT-FOOT, STUFFED DUMMY

291
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,783
NAMED GULLIVER TIED TO A TABLE.

292
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,743
ON MY GO,

293
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,453
YOU WILL RACE TO UNTIE GULLIVER,

294
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:48,082
AND PICK HIM UP AND CARRY HIM
OVER A SERIES OF OBSTACLES.

295
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,917
IF YOU DROP GULLIVER,

296
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,837
YOU HAVE TO GO BACK
TO THE PREVIOUS OBSTACLE.

297
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,256
FIRST TEAM TO CROSS
THE FINISH LINE

298
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,799
WITH GULLIVER WINS REWARD.

299
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:57,925
WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING FOR?

300
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,802
>> OH, YEAH.

301
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:00,970
>> Jeff: THE WINNING TEAM
WILL LEAVE HERE

302
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,265
AND BE TAKEN
TO OUR<i> SURVIVOR</i> CINEMA

303
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:07,685
WHERE YOU WILL ENJOY
A MOVIE PREMIERE.

304
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,979
IT'S A SNEAK PEEK OF A MOVIE
CALLED<i> GULLIVER'S TRAVELS,</i>

305
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,481
NOT YET BEEN RELEASED

306
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,775
STARRING JACK BLACK
AND JASON SIEGEL.

307
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:15,901
WHILE YOU ARE WATCHING
THIS MOVIE,

308
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,903
YOU WILL ENJOY MOVIE FOOD,

309
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:21,824
NACHOS, HOT DOGS,

310
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,994
POPCORN AND LOTS
AND LOTS OF CANDY.

311
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,537
>> YES.

312
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,539
>> Jeff: NOW, THERE'S A THEME
TO THIS MOVIE.

313
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:32,668
THE THEME IS IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW BIG YOU ARE ON THE OUTSIDE.

314
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:36,213
IT MATTERS HOW BIG YOU ARE
ON THE INSIDE.

315
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,841
YOU GUYS HAVE SURVIVED 28 DAYS.

316
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,177
YOUR ABILITY TO DRAW FROM WITHIN

317
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,013
WILL BE WHAT GETS YOU
THROUGH THESE LAST 11,

318
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,973
AND WILL HELP YOU WIN
TODAY'S CHALLENGE.

319
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,433
WORTH PLAYING FOR?

320
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,476
>> YEAH.

321
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,519
>> EVERY TIME WE GO
TO CHALLENGE,

322
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,021
I'M NOT GOING
TO JUST BE MEDIOCRE

323
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,190
BECAUSE I'M READY TO GO.

324
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,858
I'M STILL GOING TO GO 100%.

325
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,026
I'M NOT GOING TO LET
MY TEAM DOWN.

326
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,695
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOING
TO DO A SCHOOL YARD PICK

327
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:00,696
TO GET OUR TEAMS.

328
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,823
WE'LL GET STARTED.

329
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,369
ALL RIGHT,
AFTER THE SCHOOL YARD PICK,

330
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,871
WE HAVE OUR TWO TEAMS.

331
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:13,834
FOR YELLOW, FABIO, SASH,
JANE, PURPLE KELLY.

332
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:18,339
FOR BLUE WE HAVE HOLLY,
NAONKA, CHASE, AND BENRY.

333
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,549
DAN WAS NOT SELECTED.

334
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,885
HE AWAITS YOU AT THE FINISH.

335
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,888
DAN HAS OPTED
TO BACK THE BLUE TEAM.

336
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,057
IF THE BLUE TEAM WINS,
DAN WILL JOIN YOU ON REWARD.

337
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,726
HERE WE GO.

338
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,102
SURVIVORS READY?

339
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,103
GO!

340
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,064
>> I GOT THIS ONE.

341
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,941
>> Jeff: FIRST THING
YOU HAVE TO DO

342
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,234
IS GET GULLIVER UNTIED.

343
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,527
>> OH, MY GOD.

344
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,737
>> Jeff: RESCUE THIS
8-FOOT DUMMY.

345
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,572
>> NO, DON'T DO THAT ONE, KELLY.

346
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,574
NO, I'M ALREADY UNTYING IT.

347
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,785
>> Jeff: YELLOW TEAM
ALREADY HAVING

348
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:48,786
SOME COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS.

349
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,622
>> OKAY, I GOT THE FEET.

350
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:55,251
>> Jeff: HOLLY, NAONKA, CHASE
AND BENRY DOING A GREAT JOB.

351
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,669

00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,695
THAT'S THE ONLY ONE
WE'VE GOT LEFT.

365
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:26,115
>> Jeff: YELLOW TEAM NOW
HAS THEIR DUMMY RELEASED.

366
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,449
>> I CAN'T GET THE LAST ONE.

367
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,742
I CAN'T GET THIS ONE.

368
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,912
>> Jeff: YELLOW TEAM PICKS UP

369
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:35,082

00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,495
YOU'VE GOT TO CARRY HIM,

387
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,246
AND THAT'S WHERE
IT GETS DIFFICULT.

388
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,625
GULLIVER WEIGHS A LOT.

389
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,461
>> HOLD HIM, BENRY.

THROUGH THE HAY.

415
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,393

417
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,313

00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,424
YELLOW WITH A SLIGHT LEAD.

429
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,927
>> COME ON, BEN, PULL HIM!

430
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:55,931

00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,472
NAONKA TAKES A HARD FALL,

00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,348

455
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,477
AS THE BLUE TEAM WINS REWARD!

456
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,520
>> YAY!

457
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,691
>> WE CAN'T LOOK BACK ON IT.

458
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,318
>> SHOULD WE ASK THEM
IF WE CAN EAT THE CHICKEN?

459
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,820
>> WHO GIVES A FLYING...

460
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:52,863
THEY'RE EATING TONIGHT.

461
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:53,489

00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,294
NO EFFORT.

00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,629
YOU GET ALL THE REWARD.

471
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,339
HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

472
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,715
YOU'RE GOING TO LEAVE HERE.

473
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,550
YOU'LL BE TAKEN
TO OUR<i> SURVIVOR</i> CINEMA.

474
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,511
YOU'LL ENJOY A SCREENING,

475
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,221
A SNEAK PEEK
OF<i> GULLIVER'S TRAVELS,</i>

476
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,264
NACHOS, HOT DOGS,

477
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,351
POPCORN,
AND ALL THE CANDY YOU CAN EAT.

478
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,311
>> OH, MY GOD.

479
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,354
>> JEFF, CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

480
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,355
>> Jeff: YES.

481
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:30,526
>> I'VE GIVEN THIS GAME 110%.

482
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,610
THIS LAST CHALLENGE,

483
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,321
I GAVE EVERY LAST BIT
OF EVERYTHING THAT I HAD.

484
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:37,366
AND MY BODY IS JUST WEARING DOWN

485
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,743
AND IT'S TEARING DOWN,

486
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:40,577
AND THIS WILL BE MY LAST DAY,

487
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,163
AND I WANTED TO GO OUT
WITH A BANG

488
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:43,831
WITH MY WINNING TEAM.

489
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,707
>> Jeff: SO YOU'RE QUITTING.

490
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,875
>> YES.

491
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,711
>> Jeff: ANYBODY ELSE HERE WANT
TO QUIT?

492
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,547
>> I...

493
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,007
28 DAYS,

494
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,218
IT'S BEEN 28 DAYS
OF AN ADVENTURE, BUT...

495
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,594
>> Jeff: YOU'RE QUITTING, TOO?

496
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,388
>> ONE MORE DAY OFF A COUPLE
OF SPOONS OF RICE

497
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,683
PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY
IS EXHAUSTING.

498
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,893
AND A COUPLE OF HOURS A SLEEP...

499
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:05,853
THIS IS MY LAST DAY.

500
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:10,482
>> Jeff: NAONKA, YOU'VE GOT
11 DAYS LEFT.

501
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,902
YOU DON'T SEEM LIKE A QUITTER.

502
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,404
>> I'M NOT A QUITTER.

503
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,905
I GUESS I COULD SAY, ULTIMATELY,

504
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:17,906
THIS IS MY FIRST TIME QUITTING,

505
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,784
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I GOT TO LISTEN TO MY BODY.

506
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,245
AND I'M CONTENT
WITH THE DECISION.

507
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,621
>> Jeff: PURPLE KELLY,
HOW ABOUT YOU?

508
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,248
YOUNGEST PERSON OUT HERE.

509
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,083
YOU'VE DONE AN AMAZING JOB.

510
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,751
YOU'RE GOING TO WALK AWAY?

511
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,589
>> IT'S CRAZY,
BUT AFTER THE FIRST NIGHT,

512
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,257
I CAN'T BELIEVE I LASTED
27 MORE DAYS AFTER THAT.

513
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,051
THAT WAS INSANE.

514
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,761
AND I HAD INTEGRITY
THE WHOLE TIME.

515
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,221
SO...

516
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,264
I'M GOOD.

517
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,307
>> Jeff: WELL, I'M NOT GOOD.

518
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,935
NAONKA, YOU HAVE DONE THINGS
OUT HERE

519
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,770
THAT YOU HAVE REGRETTED
DAYS LATER,

520
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,063
LIKE STEALING FOOD.

521
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,773
PURPLE KELLY,
YOU JUST SAID IT YOURSELF,

522
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,650
YOU WANTED TO QUIT EARLY ON,
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

523
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,111
SO I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU GUYS

524
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:57,946
THE THIS AFTERNOON
TO THINK ABOUT IT,

525
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,323
AND WE'RE GOING TO MEET
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

526
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,117
AND IF AFTER THINKING ABOUT IT,

527
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,745
YOU STILL WANT TO WALK AWAY
ON DAY 28

528
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:08,749
AND GIVE UP A SHOT
AT A MILLION BUCKS, THEN, FINE.

529
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:09,333
I'M SURE EVERYBODY ELSE HERE
WOULD LOVE IT.

530
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,501
SOUND GOOD?

531
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,669
SOUND GOOD?

532
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:13,962
>> IT DOES.

533
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,632
>> Jeff: YOU'RE THIS CLOSE TO
BEING ABLE TO SAY, "I DID IT."

534
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,635
AND YOU'RE THIS CLOSE
TO BEING ONE OF THOSE OTHERS,

535
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,470
THE QUITTERS,
THAT NOBODY REMEMBERS.

536
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,598
THINK ABOUT IT.

537
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,516
IN THE MEANTIME,

538
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,310
WE HAVE A REWARD TO DEAL WITH,

539
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,145
AND HERE'S A LITTLE DILEMMA.

540
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:33,815
28 DAYS OUT HERE HAS BEEN VERY,
VERY TOUGH.

541
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,525
YOU JUST HAD A FIRE.

542
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,903
YOU LOST HALF YOUR TARP
AND MOST OF YOUR FOOD.

543
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,780
YOU'RE LIVING
ON A SPOON FULL OF RICE.

544
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,658
IF THERE'S ONE PERSON
FROM THIS WINNING TEAM,

545
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,452
NAONKA, BENRY, HOLLY OR CHASE,

546
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,997
THAT IS WILLING TO GIVE UP THE
REWARD,

547
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,499
FORGO THE BREAK FROM CAMP,

548
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:54,169
YOU CAN TAKE BACK
FOR THE ENTIRE CAMP

549
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:58,382
TARP AND ENOUGH RICE

550
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,467
TO GET YOU
THROUGH THE LAST 11 DAYS.

551
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:04,638
ONE PERSON STAYS BEHIND,

552
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,182
EVERYBODY ELSE GOES.

553
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:08,642
THIS IS A HERO MOVE

554
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:12,396
OR A HEROINE MOVE.

555
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,029
>> I'LL DO IT.

556
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,906
>> Jeff: HOLLY, NOT HESITATING.

557
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,366
>> I NEED TO TAKE CARE
OF THESE GUYS.

558
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,369
WHEN I GO HOME,

559
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,370
I'LL EAT AS MANY HOT DOGS
AS I WANT.

560
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,206
I HAVE 11 DAYS OF MY LIFE.

561
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:32,040
>> YOU SHOULD TO IT, MAN.

562
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,042
>> TELL HER TO SIT DOWN
AND YOU DO IT.

563
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,335
>> AND FOR THESE GUYS.

564
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,379
YOU GUYS GO HAVE FUN.

565
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,046
>> YOU'RE GOING
TO GO EAT TONIGHT.

566
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,715
>> EAT MY SHARE OF HOT DOGS.

567
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,009
HAVE MY SHARE OF CANDY,

568
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,885
BUT WE HAVE 11 DAYS LEFT.

569
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,053
>> SHE NEEDS TO EAT.

570
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:45,470
>> TO HAVE RICE.

571
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,430
I'LL TAKE IT.

572
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,640
>> Jeff: COME GET THE REWARD.

573
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,683
(APPLAUSE)

574
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:50,892
>> WOW.

575
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,893
>> THANK YOU, HOLLY.

576
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,061
>> THAT'S AMAZING, HOLLY.

577
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:57,232
>> AFTER I STOOD UP AND I TOOK
THE RICE AND THE TARP,

578
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:59,568
I TURNED AND I LOOKED AT NAONKA,

579
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,445
AND I GAVE HER A LOOK LIKE,

580
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:06,742
"I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU DIDN'T STEP UP

581
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:10,078
AFTER YOU ARE LEAVING."

582
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,580
IT TOLD ME RIGHT THEN AND THERE

583
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,875
I MISJUDGED
NAONKA'S PERSONALITY.

584
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,753
I MISJUDGED THE PERSON
THAT SHE REALLY WAS.

585
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,047
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT,
WE ARE GOING TO MEET

586
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,089
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT

587
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,591
AND WE ARE GOING TO FIGURE
THIS OUT.

588
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,301
IN THE MEANTIME,

589
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,302
SMILES OVER HERE

590
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,553
BECAUSE THE FOUR
OF YOU ARE ENJOYING A REWARD.

591
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:27,596
>> THANKS, MOM.

592
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,890
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, YELLOW TEAM,

593
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,975
HEAD ON BACK,
GET SOME RICE COOKING,

594
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,394
GET THAT TARP PUT UP, GET DRY.

595
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:37,230
BLUE TEAM, YOU'VE GOT
A FUN AFTERNOON IN STORE.

596
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,774
GRAB YOUR STUFF AND HEAD OUT.

597
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:42,069
HAVE A GOOD TIME AT THE CINEMA.

598
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,241
>> UNBELIEVABLE.

599
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,843
>> GET THAT TARP UP!

600
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:10,597
>> IT'S GOING TO BE RAINING HERE
IN ABOUT 15 MINUTES.

601
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,975
>> AS MUCH FIREWOOD
AS WE CAN REAL QUICK.

602
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:14,643
>> LET'S GET AS MUCH FIREWOOD
AS WE CAN.

603
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,520
>> WHO WANTS TO DO THE TARP?

604
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,939
>> HOLLY, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THAT.

605
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,273
>> YES.

606
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,608
>> I JUST WANT TO BE DRY
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

607
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:22,651
LAST NIGHT WAS MISERABLE.

608
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,819
>> IT WAS BAD.

609
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,487
>> GRAB THAT CORNER.

610
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,447
>> AFTER THE CHALLENGE TODAY,

611
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,615
HOLLY STEPPED UP AND SAID,
"YOU KNOW WHAT?

612
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:32,035
I'LL FORFEIT MY REWARD
FOR TARP AND RICE.

613
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,329
I CAN EAT HOT DOGS WHENEVER."

614
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,289
IT WAS A PRETTY COOL GESTURE,
YOU KNOW.

615
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,666
HOLLY IS A GENUINE PERSON.

616
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,001
SHE LIKES DOING NICE THINGS
FOR PEOPLE.

617
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,962
IT WAS GREAT FOR ME.

618
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,505
I WASN'T GOING
ON THE REWARD ANYWAY.

619
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,841
SO NOW WE'VE GOT EXTRA RICE
AND AN EXTRA TARP.

620
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:46,675
>> GET IT OVER THAT OTHER ONE.

621
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,510
>> WE'RE GOING TO GO
GET FIREWOOD.

622
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,554
>> OKAY.

623
00:23:58,728 --> 00:23:59,896
>> I JUST DON'T THINK...

624
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,189
>> I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
SOME ADVICE.

625
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,191
>> OKAY. PLEASE DO.

626
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,818
>> OKAY, THIS IS WHAT I TELL
MY DAUGHTER.

627
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,027
>> OKAY.

628
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,904
>> YOU CAME HERE FOR A REASON.

629
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,030
>> YES.

630
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,532
>> THE REASON IS
TO PLAY<i> SURVIVOR.</i>

631
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,867
>> YEAH.

632
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,535
>> YOU NEED TO SUCK IT UP

633
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,537
AND YOU NEED TO PLAY THE GAME.

634
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,539
IF YOU QUIT,

635
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,623
YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING
TO BE REMEMBERED

636
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:23,086
AS THE GIRL WHO QUIT
<i>SURVIVOR: NICARAGUA 21.</i>

637
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,838
>> I KNOW.

638
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,174
>> WHAT IS YOUR
NUMBER ONE REASON FOR QUITTING?

639
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,050
>> I JUST FREEZE AND FREEZE.

640
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:29,885
AND IT'S, LIKE,

641
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,762
THE SUN IS OUT
AND SO I CAN GET THROUGH

642
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,055
AND WORK THROUGH IT,

643
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,557
BUT IT'S LIKE
WHEN THERE'S RAIN...

644
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,434
>> BUT NOW I GOT YOU A TARP.

645
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:38,059
>> I KNOW, I KNOW.

646
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,228
I JUST THINK IT'S STILL...

647
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,897
THE WHOLE FOOD ISSUE.

648
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,065
>> I JUST GOT YOU MORE RICE.

649
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:44,774
>> I KNOW YOU DID.

650
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,943
>> YOU WOULD RATHER WALK AWAY

651
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,779
FROM THIS GAME
BEING VOTED OUT THAN TO QUIT.

652
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,699
>> BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH LONGER I CAN...

653
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,076
I CAN, LIKE, PUT UP WITH THIS.

654
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,912
LIKE, EMOTIONALLY,
I'M, LIKE, A WRECK.

655
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,706
>> HONEY, WHY?

656
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,958
WE GOT A TARP.

657
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,251
WE GOT MORE FOOD.

658
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,628
YOU GOT TO...

659
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:05,837
YOU GOT TO BE TOUGH INSIDE.

660
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:09,049
THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT WORSE
THINGS IN LIFE THAN THIS.

661
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,551
>> HOLLY BRINGING
IN THE TARP AND THE RICE

662
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,345
DEFINITELY GIVES ME HOPE,

663
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,722
BUT FROM THE MOM'S POINT OF VIEW
SHE SAID,"SUCK IT UP.

664
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:16,765
YOU ONLY HAVE A FEW MORE DAYS."

665
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,768
BUT IT'S LIKE I'VE BEEN
SUCKING IT UP FOR 28 DAYS.

666
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:23,146
I HAVE NOTHING LEFT TO SUCK.

667
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,107
>> MY DAUGHTERS WANTED
TO QUIT CROSSCOUNTRY.

668
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,609
I SAID, "ABSOLUTELY NOT.

669
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:28,735
YOU STARTED.

670
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,779
YOU'RE FINISHING."

671
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,658
THEY ENDED UP BEING
STATE CHAMPIONS THAT YEAR.

672
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,290
YOU NEED TO SERIOUSLY THINK
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

673
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:42,791
>> I WILL.

674
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:43,625
I KNOW I NEED TO.

675
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:47,003
>> ON DAY 5,
WHEN I WANTED TO LEAVE,

676
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,630
JIMMY JOHNSON SAID TO ME,

677
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:49,839
"IF YOU STICK THIS OUT,

678
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,883
EVEN YOU MAKE IT 10 DAYS,

679
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,637
THINK OF HOW PROUD YOUR HUSBAND

680
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,514
AND YOUR CHILDREN ARE GOING
TO BE OF YOU."

681
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,307
AND THAT HIT ME LIKE A WALL.

682
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,642
AND I'M LIKE, "I'M STAYING."

683
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,102
AM I HUNGRY?

684
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,478
I'M STARVING!

685
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:06,147
BUT I'M LOOKING TOWARDS THE END.

686
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,816
AND BY ME NOT QUITTING,

687
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,151
I HOPE THAT I'M GOING
TO BE AN INSPIRATION

688
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,487
FOR MY CHILDREN
THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.

689
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,822
>> OKAY, SO MAMA HOLLY
JUST SAID WHAT SHE THOUGHT.

690
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,824
>> I THANK YOU.

691
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,922
>> YEAH!

692
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,674
YEAH, BABY.

693
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:36,344
>> OH, MY!

694
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,305
>> NOW SHOWING
<i>GULLIVER'S TRAVELS.</i>

695
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:41,349
LITTLE MOVIE NIGHT, BABY.

696
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:41,891
>> WOW!

697
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:42,934
>> YES!

698
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,520
>> THIS IS AMAZING!

699
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,772
>> OH, MY GOD!

700
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,487
>> LOAD IT UP.

701
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,405
>> I'M HAVING A HOT DOG.

702
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,032
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

703
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,867
>> KETCHUP I HAVEN'T HAD KETCHUP
IN 20-WHATEVER DAYS.

704
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,869
>> WALK INTO
THIS LITTLE GRASS HUT

705
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,871
AND FRANKFURTERS WERE COOKING.

706
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,707
THERE WAS FRESH-POPPED POPCORN,

707
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,335
THERE WAS EVERY KIND
OF CHOCOLATE CANDY YOU WANTED.

708
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,878
EVERYTHING, AND SO IT WAS GREAT.

709
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,004
IT WAS SUPER.

710
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,213
>> THIS IS CRAZY.

711
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,214
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

712
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,841
>> GOD!

713
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:18,011
THIS IS FREAKING RIDICULOUS,
Y'ALL.

714
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:20,930
>> I WISH HOLLY WAS HERE, MAN.

715
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,015
>> SHE TOOK ONE FOR THE TEAM.

716
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:26,061
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS
EXTREMELY SELFISH OF NAONKA

717
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,020
TO OPT OUT OF THE GAME

718
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,730
AND THEN CHOOSE TO STILL GO
ON THE REWARD.

719
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,441
I MEAN, GO HOME,
GET A LITTLE BIT OF RICE,

720
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,401
AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING
TO EAT WELL BECAUSE YOU'RE DONE.

721
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,944
AND THAT'S WHAT NAONKA
SHOULD HAVE DONE.

722
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,196
>> THIS IS INSANE.

723
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,238
>> THIS IS HEAVEN.

724
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,406
>> I WASN'T ABOUT TO STEP DOWN

725
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,201
BECAUSE I DIDN'T GIVE 110%
IN THAT CHALLENGE TO SAY,

726
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,411
"OKAY, WELL, YOU KNOW,

727
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:47,415
I'M ABOUT TO GO HOME ANYWAY,
SO I GUESS I'LL GO AHEAD

728
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,042
AND GET YOU GUYS THE RICE
AND THE TARP."

729
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,585
UH-UH,
I WASN'T ABOUT TO DO THAT.

730
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:51,586
I'M NOT NO FOOL.

731
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:51,961
>> OH, MY GOD!

732
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,922
CHEERS, BRO!

733
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,048
>> CHEERS.

734
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,966
JALAPEÑO ON THAT.

735
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,760
>> I LOVE JALAPEÑOS.

736
00:27:58,843 --> 00:27:59,928
>> SHOULD WE WATCH THIS FLICK?

737
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:04,432
>> WE'RE JUST HAVING
A COLD DRINK.

738
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,101
>> OH, SHE'S SEATS
ARE COMFY-COZY.

739
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,310
>> OH, MAN!

740
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,603
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

741
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,271
>> OH, MY GOD!

742
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,189
>> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

743
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,857
WE SAT IN A COMFORTABLE SEAT
IN 28 DAYS.

744
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,527
>> I THINK THIS MOVIE
IS GOING TO BE AMAZING.

745
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,486
I LOVE JACK BLACK.

746
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,612
>> JACK BLACK IS FUNNY AS HELL.

747
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:18,738
>> HE'S HILARIOUS.

748
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,280
>><i> GULLIVER'S TRAVELS,</i> BABY.

749
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,783
BLACK IS THE NEW BIG.

750
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,952
>> PLEASE DON'T BE...

751
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:24,953
F-FANS.

752
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,955
(SCREAMING)

753
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,630
>> JACK BLACK!

754
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:38,258
>> FIRE!

755
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:48,935
>> SO FAT.

756
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:53,314
>> WE HAD SOME FUN AND,
YOU KNOW,

757
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,525
WE WERE LAUGHING, BUT, YOU KNOW,

758
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,777
NAONKA DEFINITELY CONCERNS ME
A LITTLE BIT.

759
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,155
THE WHOLE TIME
I WAS JUST THINKING,

760
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,657
YOU KNOW, PLEASE LEAVE,
PLEASE LEAVE.

761
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,326
GET OUT OF THIS GAME AND MAKE IT
A LITTLE BIT EASIER FOR ME.

762
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,085
(LAUGHTER)

763
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,966
(APPLAUSE)

764
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,009
>> ALL RIGHT.

765
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,928
>> THAT WAS REALLY CUTE.

766
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,972
>> THAT'S A GOOD FLICK.

767
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:28,349
>> WE'RE GOING
TO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

768
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,185
AND IT FEELS GOOD, YOU KNOW,

769
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,644
TO HAVE THIS ENERGY.

770
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:32,479
AND I JUST FEED OFF THAT ENERGY

771
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,522
AND IT JUST MAKES ME
FEEL EXPLOSIVE.

772
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,191
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHERE LIFE WILL TAKE YOU.

773
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,692
IT MADE ME REALIZE

774
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:39,027
THAT I HAVE TO PUT EVERYTHING
INTO PERSPECTIVE.

775
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,863
IF I STAYED,

776
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,908
DANG, I COULD WIN
A MILLION DOLLARS.

777
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:55,543
>> WE'LL BE EXCITED ABOUT THE
FIRE RIGHT HERE

778
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,252
TO KEEP THE BUGS OUT.

779
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,671
>> GUYS, THIS IS A COOL SETUP.

780
00:29:58,755 --> 00:29:59,214
>> UH-HUH.

781
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,049
>> HOLLY, THAT'S, LIKE,

782
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,384
ONE OF THE SMARTEST DECISIONS
YOU YOU COULD HAVE MADE.

783
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,719
>> THANKS, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

784
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:06,012
JANE WOULD HAVE DONE
THE SAME THING.

785
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,055
>> I KNOW.

786
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,389
>> YEAH.

787
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,891
>> I WANT TO WIN.

788
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,518
QUITTING HAS NOT CROSSED
MY MIND.

789
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,019
WE'RE GOING
TO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT,

790
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:15,772
WHICH AUTOMATICALLY IS NOT FUN,
YOU KNOW.

791
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,106
AND PURPLE KELLY AND NAONKA

792
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,068
ARE GOING TO DECIDE
IF THEY WANT TO GO HOME.

793
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,069
SO WE'LL SEE.

794
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,362
IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING.

795
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,572
>> WHEN JEFF
SAID TODAY THAT, LIKE,

796
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,074
TAKING THE TARP AND THE RICE
COULD REALLY, LIKE,

797
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,451
MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR GAME.

798
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,578
I THINK THAT IT, LIKE,
DEFINITELY CAN.

799
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:31,913
>> THINK POSITIVE.

800
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,748
>> ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN TONIGHT.

801
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:35,416
NOTHING IS SET.

802
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,085
AND I THINK
THAT'S THE SCARIEST PART.

803
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,962
THE TARP AND THE RICE

804
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:41,256
CANNOT REALLY GET ME
THROUGH THE NEXT 11 DAYS.

805
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,924
I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT IT CAN,

806
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,843
BUT I JUST NEED
TO REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.

807
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:46,928
>> THAT'S A LOT OF RICE.

808
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,138
>> I THINK HAVING A
GOOD AMOUNT OF RICE TONIGHT

809
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,974
IS BETTER THAN HAVING
A BUNCH OF CANDY AND POPCORN.

810
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:51,975
>> YEAH.

811
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,393
>> PRETTY HOT.

812
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:54,769
>> REALLY HOT.

813
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:56,646
>> DEFINITELY THE HARDEST
TRIBAL COUNCIL FOR ME,

814
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,940
THE DECISION
IS NOT GONNA BE FINAL

815
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,609
UNTIL I'M EITHER
WALKING BACK OUT

816
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,986
WITH MY TORCH OR LEAVING.

817
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,601
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING
IN THE PEOPLE

818
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,603
RETURNING FROM THE REWARD.

819
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,408
NOW WE'LL BRING IN OUR JURY.

820
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:57,915
ALINA, MARTY AND BRENDA,

821
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,917
VOTED OUT
AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

822
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,217
ALL RIGHT,
SO LET'S GET INTO THIS.

823
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,012
WE ARE HERE BECAUSE TODAY
AT THE REWARD CHALLENGE,

824
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,348
NAONKA AND PURPLE KELLY

825
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:17,894
BOTH SAID THEY WANTED TO QUIT.

826
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,688
BOTH OF YOU GUYS
AT DIFFERENT TIMES

827
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,065
HAVE SAID AND DONE THINGS

828
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,816
THAT YOU LATER RETGRETTED.

829
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,485
SO I SAID TAKE THE AFTERNOON,

830
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:26,527
THINK ABOUT IT,

831
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,739
MAKE SURE THIS IS A DECISION
YOU WANT TO MAKE.

832
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:32,867
HOLLY, THERE WAS A TIME

833
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,202
WHEN YOU WANTED TO QUIT
THIS GAME.

834
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,328
>> UH-HUH. DAY FIVE.

835
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,205
>> Jeff: WHAT HAPPENED
THAT MADE YOU STAY IN THE GAME?

836
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,874
>> WHAT MADE ME STAY
IN THIS GAME

837
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:41,959
IS I WENT AND TALKED
TO JIMMIE JOHNSON.

838
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,503
AND HE SAID,

839
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,005
"HAVE YOU EVER QUIT ANYTHING
IN YOUR LIFE?"

840
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,049
AND I SAID, "NEVER."

841
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,509
AND HE LOOKED AT ME AND HE SAID,

842
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:51,719
"THEN WHY DO YOU WANT
TO QUIT THIS?"

843
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,721
HE SAID,
"YOU'RE A STRONG PERSON.

844
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,765
YOU NEED TO GO FORWARD."

845
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,559
AND IF IT WASN'T FOR HIM
TELLING ME THOSE WORDS,

846
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,353
I WOULD HAVE PROBABLY BEEN GONE.

847
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,230
AND NOW I'VE MADE IT THIS FAR,

848
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,273
AND IF YOU'RE GOING
TO MAKE IT THIS FAR,

849
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:08,194
WHY NOT TRY TO GO
AS FAR AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN?

850
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:12,115
>> Jeff: JANE,
LISTENING TO YOU TALK,

851
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,242
LISTENING TO WHAT
OTHER PEOPLE SAY,

852
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,744
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE EVERY DAY'S
A WALK IN THE PARK.

853
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,247
>> NO, EVERY DAY IS NOT
A WALK IN THE PARK WITH ME.

854
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,248
I KNEW I HAD DRIVE.

855
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,583
I KNEW I HAD DETERMINATION,

856
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,419
AND I KNEW I HAD THAT SPUNK

857
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,838
THAT WOULD HELP ME GET OVER

858
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,297
ANY HURDLE THAT CAME.

859
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,550
AND I'M HANGING IN THERE.

860
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,885
I WISH THEY WOULD HANG IN HERE.

861
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,595
YOU KNOW,

862
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,805
YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE DRIVE.

863
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,390
DO YOU HAVE
TO HAVE DETERMINATION.

864
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,933
YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE HEART.

865
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:40,143
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE
THAT WILLINGNESS

866
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,603
TO GO FORTH THAT EXTRA MILE

867
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,146
TO GET IT DONE.

868
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,773
>> Jeff: SO, NAONKA,

869
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,608
TAKE ME BACK TO THIS MORNING.

870
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,402
WHEN DID THIS START FOR YOU,

871
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,028
THIS THOUGHT OF QUITTING?

872
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,947
>> UM, WHEN IT'S RAINING
LIKE THIS

873
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,657
AND IT GETS REAL WINDY,

874
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,075
MY JOINTS GET TO HURTING.

875
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,410
SO THIS MORNING IT HIT ME, LIKE,

876
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,245
REALLY, REALLY, HARD
BECAUSE IT STARTED POURING

877
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,747
AND IT GOT REALLY, REALLY WINDY,

878
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,330
AND I'M FREEZING.

879
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,958
I'M LITERALLY FREEZING.

880
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:06,836
I'M PROUD TO SAY
THAT I LASTED 28 DAYS.

881
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,129
I'M THE ONLY AFRICAN-AMERICAN
STILL HERE,

882
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,798
AND I'M A STRONG WOMAN.

883
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,134
I COME FROM A BACKGROUND
OF STRONG BLACK WOMEN.

884
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,761
>> Jeff: PURPLE KELLY,

885
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:15,803
HOW ABOUT YOU?

886
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,305
WHEN DID IT FIRST COME
TO YOUR HEAD

887
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,098
THAT MAYBE YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH?

888
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,600
>> IT CAME TO MY HEAD
THIS MORNING

889
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:21,934
AND EARLY THIS MORNING.

890
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,311
>> Jeff: WHAT HAPPENED?

891
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,312
>> IT WAS LIKE
THERE WAS GOING TO BE

892
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,272
NO END TO THE WEATHER.

893
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,025
IT WAS, LIKE,
THIS COULD GO ON FOR DAYS.

894
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,319
AND I KNOW THAT WE CAN ALL
PHYSICALLY TAKE THIS,

895
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:35,114
BUT MY BODY, I JUST FEEL
LIKE I AM BREAKING DOWN,

896
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:38,159
AND, LIKE, I KEEP THINKING,
CAN I REALLY STICK IT OUT

897
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:41,954
WHEN I PUT UP WITH SOME
OF THE WORST DAYS I'VE EVER HAD?

898
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:45,958
>> Jeff: BENRY,
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON THIS?

899
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,210
>> I DON'T KNOW.

900
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,461
I JUST DON'T LIKE, YOU KNOW,

901
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:49,587
WINNERS NEVER QUIT,

902
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,088
QUITTERS NEVER WIN SORT
OF THING.

903
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,715
I WAS RAISED BY THAT MOTTO.

904
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,675
AND IT'S JUST FRUSTRATING FOR ME

905
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,343
TO SIT HERE AND LISTEN,

906
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,846
YOU KNOW, TO THESE TWO GIRLS

907
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,057
THAT ARE OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW,

908
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,391
VERY CAPABLE OF STICKING
OUT THE LAST 11 DAYS.

909
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,520
>> Jeff: FABIO,
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IN AGE

910
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,021
BETWEEN YOU AND PURPLE KELLY?

911
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,022
>> ONE YEAR.

912
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:09,357
>> Jeff: DO YOU THINK
THIS IS AN AGE THING?

913
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,526
>> NO, I DON'T THINK IT'S AGE.

914
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,944
I THINK IT'S MENTAL WILL POWER

915
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,195
AND THE WILL TO BE HERE

916
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,905
AND WHAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN
GO THROUGH.

917
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,198
WE'RE THE SAME AGE,

918
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,699
AND I'M GOING TO STAY
TILL THE END, MAN.

919
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,408
I DON'T CARE
IF IT'S SNOWING OUT HERE.

920
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:22,161
I KNOW WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF,

921
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,246
AND I'M GOING TO STAY.

922
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,414
>> Jeff: SO, NAONKA,

923
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,499
WE RUN THE CHALLENGE.

924
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:27,500
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

925
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:28,626
YOUR TEAM WINS.

926
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,211
SO NOW YOU HAVE
THIS GREAT REWARD.

927
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,546
>> THE REWARD WAS BEAUTIFUL.

928
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,256
IT WAS LIKE A CELEBRATION.

929
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,383
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT NOTHING

930
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,051
BUT THE GREAT THINGS
THAT HAVE HAPPENED.

931
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:37,593
I HAD A BALL TODAY.

932
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,554
AND I LOOKED AT IT LIKE,

933
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,055
LET'S HAVE A GOOD TIME.

934
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:42,431
>> Jeff: REALISTICALLY,

935
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,059
YOU THINK YOU HAD
ANY SHOT TO WIN THIS GAME?

936
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,102
>> YES.

937
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,562
>> Jeff: BASED ON WHAT?

938
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,397
>> BASED ON MY DRIVE

939
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,773
ONCE UPON A TIME.

940
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:51,774
>> Jeff: THIS IS AMAZING.

941
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,067
PLEASE, GO ON.

942
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,569
REGALE ME WITH A STORY, WOMAN.

943
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,280
>> WELL,
MY DRIVE AND MY ATTITUDE,

944
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,447
MY SPUNK, MY CHARM.

945
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,408
I MEAN, IT'S 28 DAYS.

946
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:03,244
>> Jeff: AND I JUST WANT
TO BE CLEAR.

947
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,371
YOU THINK YOU HAD A SHOT
AT WINNING THIS GAME?

948
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,707
>> I DON'T THINK, I KNOW I DID.

949
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,251
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT,
SO AFTER THIS GREAT REWARD,

950
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,753
YOU WATCH<i> GULLIVER'S TRAVELS.</i>

951
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,213
DID YOU LIKE
<i>GULLIVER'S TRAVELS?</i>

952
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,214
>> I LOVED IT; IT WAS FUN.

953
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,215
>> IT WAS AWESOME.

954
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,216
>> GOOD MOVIE.

955
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:17,884
>> Jeff: YEAH,
YOU DUG IT, BENRY?

956
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,385
>> YEAH, IT WAS INTERESTING.

957
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:21,929
VERY RELATIVE
TO WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH.

958
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,306
HE HAD TO FIND IT IN HIM

959
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,433
TO OVERCOME A LOT
OF DIFFERENT OBSTACLES

960
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,394
AND IT DEFINITELY SORT
OF HIT HOME,

961
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,605
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE
IN WATCHING IT,

962
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,607
IT WOULD HAVE HIT HOME
FOR HER, TOO.

963
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:36,110
>> Jeff: SO AFTER NAONKA, CHASE,

964
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:38,112
BENRY, AND HOLLY WON THE REWARD,

965
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:40,489
I SAID,
"IF JUST ONE OF YOU IS WILLING

966
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,450
TO GIVE UP THE REWARD
THEY JUST EARNED,

967
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,953
YOU COULD TAKE HOME WITH YOU

968
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,581
A TARP AND A BIG TIN OF RICE."

969
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:51,584
NAONKA, YOU'D ALREADY TOLD ME

970
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:52,919
YOU WANTED TO QUIT.

971
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,629
YOU WERE ALREADY READY
TO GO HOME,

972
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,130
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN VOLUNTEER

973
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:57,506
TO TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM.

974
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,925
>> I DIDN'T WANT TO.

975
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,801
I WAS GOING TO GO OUT
WITH A BANG.

976
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,470
>> Jeff: DO YOU SEE THAT
AT ALL AS SELFISH?

977
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,305
>> I DON'T CARE
WHAT ANYBODY THINKS.

978
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,099
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT ANYBODY'S OPINIONS.

979
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,185
I'M STILL THE SAME NAONKA
I WAS BEFORE,

980
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,604
AND I'M STILL GOING TO BE NAONKA
AFTER I LEAVE HERE.

981
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,481
>> Jeff: CHASE,
YOU'RE SHAKING YOUR HEAD.

982
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,524
>> THAT WAS THE ONE THING

983
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,652
THAT I DID DISAGREE WITH.

984
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:18,819
IF I WAS GOING HOME,

985
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:19,487
I WOULD HAVE GIVEN
THE REST OF EVERYONE

986
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,322
THE TARP AND RICE.

987
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,990
>> EVERYBODY HAS
THEIR OWN OPINIONS.

988
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,159
EVERYBODY IS GOING TO THINK
THAT I MADE A MISTAKE,

989
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:27,119
OR I'M PUTTING MY FOOT
IN MY MOUTH,

990
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,162
BUT I'M CONTENT.

991
00:37:28,245 --> 00:37:31,958
>> Jeff: JANE, WHAT IS IT
THAT A YOUNG PERSON

992
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,001
CAN'T SEE RIGHT NOW,
THEY CAN'T GRASP,

993
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,878
BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T
HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE?

994
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:39,674
>> WELL, THE YOUNG KIDS
ARE GOING TO FIND OUT

995
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,550
LIFE IS NOT A PIECE OF CAKE

996
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,344
UNLESS THEY'VE GOT AN EASY RIDE
FROM THEIR PARENTS.

997
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,389
YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE

998
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:47,848
WHAT'S AROUND THE CORNER.

999
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,767
LIFE IS FULL OF ROCKY ROADS.

1000
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,352
I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH.

1001
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,855
AND LIFE IS NOT AN EASY RIDE
FOR, LIKE,

1002
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,149
90% OF THE PEOPLE OUT THERE.

1003
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,527
AND WITH THE ECONOMY
THE WAY IT IS RIGHT NOW,

1004
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,736
JOBS ARE SCARCE.

1005
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,531
SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE SOME SORT
OF DRIVE AND DETERMINATION

1006
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,408
TO SHOW AN EMPLOYER

1007
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,827
THAT YOU'RE BETTER
THAN SOMEBODY ELSE,

1008
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,370
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET HIRED.

1009
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,414
THERE'S PEOPLE OUT THERE
THAT'S A WHOLE LOT WORSE OFF

1010
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,040
THAN US RIGHT NOW,

1011
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,583
AND THEY'RE NOT
PLAYING<i> SURVIVOR.</i>

1012
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,502
WE ARE.

1013
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:20,381
>> Jeff: ON THAT,

1014
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,424
LET'S GET DOWN TO THE DECISION.

1015
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:24,385
RIGHT NOW, NAONKA,

1016
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:28,347
YOU HAVE A ONE IN NINE SHOT

1017
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,724
AT A MILLION DOLLARS.

1018
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:30,558
YES OR NO,

1019
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,060
ARE YOU GOING TO STAY
IN THIS GAME

1020
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,729
AND FIGHT FOR A SHOT TO WIN IT,

1021
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,772
OR ARE YOU GOING TO QUIT?

1022
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,569
>> I'M GOING TO QUIT.

1023
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,571
>> Jeff: NAONKA'S GOING TO QUIT.

1024
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,073
PURPLE KELLY,

1025
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,576
YOU NOW HAVE A ONE IN EIGHT SHOT

1026
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:49,452
AT WINNING THIS GAME.

1027
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,746
YOUR ODDS JUST IMPROVED

1028
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:52,538
WITH NAONKA QUITTING.

1029
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:55,416
YOU'RE GOING TO STAY AND FIGHT

1030
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:59,253
OR ARE YOU GOING TO QUIT?

1031
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:00,588
>> I'M GOING TO QUIT.

1032
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,632
>> Jeff: PURPLE KELLY'S GOING
TO QUIT.

1033
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:04,467
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

1034
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:08,262
>> Jeff: THAT MEANS
THE REST OF YOU

1035
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,597
JUST MOVED UP TWO NOTCHES

1036
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,433
AND DIDN'T HAVE
TO VOTE ANYBODY OUT.

1037
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,478
NAONKA, WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD DO WITH YOUR TORCH?

1038
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:18,481
>> WHAT HAPPENED TO THEIRS?

1039
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:19,565
IT GOT SMUFFED.

1040
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:20,900
>> SMUFFED!

1041
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,110
>> IS THAT THE WORD, SMUF?

1042
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,653
>> Jeff: BUT, NAONKA,

1043
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,238
THEY DIDN'T QUIT.

1044
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,783
PURPLE KELLY,

1045
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:29,450
WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE DONE
WITH YOUR TORCH?

1046
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,452
YOU GUYS ARE QUITTERS?

1047
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:34,455
>> I THINK IT SHOULD BE SNUFFED,
TOO.

1048
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:38,125
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT,

1049
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,460
SO I'LL SNUFF YOUR TORCHES,

1050
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,088
BUT WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THEM
HERE AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1051
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,589
THEY'LL BE A REMINDER
TO YOU GUYS

1052
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:46,092
WHEN YOU COME BACK IN HERE
AS PART OF THE JURY

1053
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:49,136
OF THE DECISION YOU MADE
TO QUIT.

1054
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,013
ALL RIGHT, NAONKA,

1055
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,057
GRAB YOUR TORCH.

1056
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:55,684
>> THAT'S DISGUSTING.

1057
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,686
>> I HATE THAT, MAN.

1058
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,730
>> I WANT TO PLAY.

1059
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,653
(KISSING NOISES)

1060
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,161
>> Jeff: YOU WANT TO GO?

1061
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,162
>> YES.

1062
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,206
>> Jeff: GO.

1063
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,596
>> Jeff: PURPLE KELLY,
GRAB YOUR TORCH.

1064
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,152
HEAD OUT.

1065
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:02,042
WELL,
THERE'S A VERY CLEAR THEME--

1066
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,711
DESIRE.

1067
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:07,047
THAT WILL POWER THAT COMES
FROM WITHIN.

1068
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,591
THERE ARE 10 DAYS LEFT.

1069
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,718
YOU GUYS NOW HAVE
A ONE IN SEVEN SHOT.

1070
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:11,260
NO MORE EXCUSES.

1071
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:14,013
IT IS TIME TO STEP UP

1072
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:16,390
AND START PLAYING THIS GAME.

1073
00:41:16,473 --> 00:41:18,350
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

1074
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,351
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1075
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,353
GOOD NIGHT.

1076
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,608
>> THAT'S REALLY... UP, MAN.

1077
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,067
I MEAN, THAT'S REALLY TWISTED.

1078
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:30,070
>> I GAVE HER
SO MUCH MORE CREDIT.

1079
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:47,588
>> JEFF: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

1080
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,593
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON<i> SURVIVOR:</i>

1081
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,720
THE SEVEN PLAYERS
STILL IN THE GAME WANT IT,

1082
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,222
AND THEY WANT IT BAD.

1083
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,306
>> IT'S GOING TO BE A FIGHT
TO THE FINISH.

1084
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,766
>> Jeff: THE KNIVES COME OUT,
AND NO ONE IS SAFE.

1085
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:02,102
>> THE ONLY PERSON THAT COULD
BEAT YOU AT THE END IS JANE.

1086
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,437
>> WE'RE VOTING JANE OFF.

1087
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,772
>> AND HOLLY WILL ABSOLUTELY
BE GOING HOME.

1088
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,899
>> I JUST DON'T TRUST SASH.

1089
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,275
>> FABIO'S GOING HOME.

1090
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,486
>> CRAZY WHAT A COUPLE
OF HOURS CAN DO AROUND CAMP.

1091
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,995
>> I AM VERY SORRY FOR ALINA,
MARTY AND BRENDA.

1092
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,747
IT'S HARD TO LOOK AT THEM

1093
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,625
AND KNOW THAT THEY COULD HAVE

1094
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,668
POSSIBLY BEEN IN THE TOP THREE.

1095
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,294
I FEEL BAD.

1096
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,296
>> I FEEL LIKE I OWE NOBODY

1097
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,798
AN APOLOGY, NOT EVEN MYSELF.

1098
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:31,715
AND I HAVE
NO REGRETS WHATSOEVER.

1099
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,759
I MADE IT FAR.

1100
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:34,843
SO TO SAY THAT I DID THAT

1101
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,304
IS A HELL OF AN ACCOMPLISHMENT
FOR ME.
