<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,676
With his back against the wall,

4
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:11,511
Kenny, along with his trusted

5
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:13,138
ally, Crystal, engineered three

6
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,472
blindsides in a row.

7
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:15,181
Charlie, the tribe has spoken.

8
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,183
...to create the most powerful

9
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,184
alliance in the game.

10
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,561
>> I'm like a little rat.

11
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:20,562
I go...

12
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:21,980
You mess with me, then you're

13
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:22,814
gone in this game.

14
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,065
>> PROBST: His smartest play was

15
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,233
when he convinced Susie to

16
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:26,443
switch alliances and join him.

17
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,153
>> It's going down, Kenny.

18
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:29,446
I knew you were my boy.

19
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,321
>> PROBST: The only potential

20
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,656
roadblocks on his path to the

21
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,074
finals are the two hidden

22
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,452
immunity idols: a real one...

23
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,162
>> Mm. Okay.

24
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,163
>> PROBST: ...owned by Sugar...

25
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:39,205
>> I found it.

26
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,123
>> PROBST: ...and an

27
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:40,707
amazing-looking counterfeit

28
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,166
created by Bob.

29
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,334
>> This is my new fake idol.

30
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,461
>> PROBST: If either idol comes

31
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,253
into play, the game changes, and

32
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:47,255
Kenny's plans could go up in

33
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,298
smoke.

34
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,591
>> It's sort of like when you're

35
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:50,675
holding up a bank.

36
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,676
You don't necessarily need the

37
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,635
gun.

38
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,178
If they think you got a gun,

39
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,138
they might leave you alone.

40
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,181
>> PROBST: Eight are left.

41
00:00:56,264 --> 00:01:08,318
Who will be voted out tonight?

42
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,069
>> Let's get it going, man.

43
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:10,779
>> That's right.

44
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:11,321
>> Nobag back in the hizzy.

45
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,113
(laughter)

46
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,114
>> Nobag.

47
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:16,743
>> Kenny and Crystal know

48
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:17,368
exactly what's going on in camp.

49
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:20,246
They know the power is shifting.

50
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,289
>> That was an intense session.

51
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,665
Dude, that was the biggest war

52
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:23,708
zone yet.

53
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:24,667
>> Yeah.

54
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,668
(laughter)

55
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,669
>> Everybody better be pretty

56
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,963
happy right here.

57
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:29,547
>> I thought I was the target

58
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,257
tonight because I was pissing

59
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,926
a whole bunch of people off.

60
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:33,927
That wasn't the case.

61
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,261
They made more of a smart vote.

62
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,639
Charlie's got a lot of friends.

63
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:42,227
I don't.

64
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,686
>> 'Cause he's the big threat.

65
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,021
>> He's a good sport.

66
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,022
>> Yes, he is.

67
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:46,981
>> He's awesome.

68
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,024
He went out with class.

69
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:49,692
>> And we're in Gabon for

70
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,819
another full moon.

71
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:51,444
>> I'm gonna do whatever I think

72
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,112
I can do.

73
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:53,613
When I wake up tomorrow

74
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:54,989
morning, I'm going to

75
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:55,990
reevaluate the situation and

76
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,158
hope to come out with something.

77
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,701
I mean, Kenny and Crystal are

78
00:01:58,785 --> 00:01:59,327
taking out my entire alliance.

79
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,038
My chances are very slim.

80
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:02,622
You know, most likely, me, Bob

81
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,374
and Randy-- we're going to go

82
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,917
home, and we don't know in what

83
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,501
order, but we're going to go

84
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,293
home.

85
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,878
>> It's crazy.

86
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:09,546
>> Yeah, they just...

87
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,171
>> Like the beginning of the

88
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,465

Bob has made himself a fake

123
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,299
idol, and he made it out of

124
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,300
resin and beads.

125
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,885

of strategy in showing me the

129
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,473
fake immunity idol.

130
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:26,849

But I think they've probably

140
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,326
sold that story to Sugar and

141
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,369

142
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,370
they buy it.

143
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,413

144
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,455
there's five of them?

145
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,790
They can't all be final three.

146
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:51,874

Corinne is still an ally, but

151
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,673
what can you do with two people?

152
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,091
We've got immunity idols.

153
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,384
We got huge physical threats

154
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,385
like Matty.

155
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,636
Uh, I continue...

156
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,054
I'm planning on just continuing

157
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,515
to be my same charming self.

158
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,517
I don't like any of these

159
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,518

00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,519

161
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,520
>> And I hate them.

162
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,438
And if I pretended to be nice

163
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,440
and like them, like Matty's

164
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,983

165
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:17,984
that.

166
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,318
It would show through, and I

167
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,319
said, the only...

168
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,320
>> You're less damaging to

169
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:21,904
yourself by just shutting it

170
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:22,488
down.

171
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,489
>> Yeah. Well-Well, shutting it

172
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,533
down, as well as continue to

173
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:26,534
being nice.

174
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:27,577
>> Don't even bother trying to

175
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,911
be nice to Sugar, you know.

176
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,204
Just keep away from them and

177
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,539
work on Matty, and just see if

178
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,790
you can get him to understand

179
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,334
he's going to be on the chopping

180
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,126
block.

181
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,169
>> The hand I have to...

182
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:36,794
>> Give him the final three with

183
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:37,462
us.

184
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,379

185
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,256
desperate measures.

186
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,382
We've got to get somebody to

187
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,718
flip-flop now and come with us,

188
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,261
and that somebody has got to be

189
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,263
Matty because the credibility

190
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,932

giving part of Sugar's to

00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,985
Corinne?

516
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,236
>> Uh, Sugar doesn't have one.

517
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,196
I offered her one, and she

518
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,864
didn't take one, so, they're

519
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:02,990
mine.

520
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:03,324

his own cookie.

530
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:16,212
She takes it and gives it to

531
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,630
Matty.

532
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:18,422
>> Yeah, would you like to

533
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,215
repeat that?

534
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,132
>> PROBST: Wow.

535
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,592
I think it worked out the way

536
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:22,384
it worked out.

537
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,636
>> Randy, you at least have to

538
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,345
take this.

539
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,304
>> This is better for me.

540
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,055
>> You sure?

541
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,014
>> PROBST: Well, I'd suggest you

542
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,015
start eating those quickly

543
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,141
'cause the<i> Survivor</i> auction is

544
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:29,350
over.

545
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,018
>> Sugar-- she can kiss my ass.

546
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,312
If she thinks I was bad before,

547
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:34,939
I'm just going to turn it up a

548
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:35,940
notch.

549
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,608
There's a lot of fight left in

550
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:38,567
this dog.

551
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,655
>> PROBST: Have a good night.

552
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,454
>> Welcome home, Nobag.

553
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,330
(laughter)

554
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,498
>> Check it out.

555
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,123
>> Corinne, I have to say, good

556
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,959
things come to those who wait.

557
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:55,334
>> That's right.

558
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,085
>> I thought you were blowing

559
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,128
it, but you made the good

560
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:58,963
decision.

561
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,506
And, Sugar, I have to say, that

562
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,131
was the most righteous gift I've

563
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,800
ever been given.

564
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:03,759
>> What gift, Matty?

565
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:04,260
You got to be kidding me.

566
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,136
That wasn't a gift from her,

567
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:06,303
man.

568
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,054
Weren't you watching?

569
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,098
>> Thought she handed it to me.

570
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,140
>> Yeah, but that was my cookie.

571
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,141
I didn't get one.

572
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,142
>> Oh.

573
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,894
>> You had two, I had none.

574
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,020
>> Sorry.

575
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,772
>> But not your fault.

576
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,983
I left the auction broke, full,

577
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,901
half drunk, and pissed off.

578
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,195
I got a little room left for

579
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,488
one big cookie.

580
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,114
So I'm going to burn this house

581
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,449
down in the next day or so.

582
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,119
>> Oh, my God.

583
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,328
>> Over a cookie.

584
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,121
Over a cookie.

585
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,623
How funny is that?

586
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,001
Oh, my gosh.

587
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,796
Have you ever seen a grown man

588
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,131
get so mad over a chocolate

589
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,549
chip cookie?

590
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,967
And the only reason I took his

591
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,302
damn cookie is because he didn't

592
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,970
want to give me a cookie.

593
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,471
He wanted to give everybody a

594
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,598
cookie but Sugar because

595
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,642
Sugar's evil.

596
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,647
>> How you feeling, big buddy?

597
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,648
Still bitter?

598
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,274
>> Ah, there's no one to talk

599
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,025
to.

600
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,067
Nobody listens to me.

601
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,069
>> What about me?

602
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:04,945
>> You're busy talking to

603
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:05,904
everybody else, man.

604
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,448
What we witnessed today at the

605
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,991
auction-- I mean, I was treated

606
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:09,992
like a dog.

607
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:10,993
>> You've set yourself up,

608
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:11,994
Randy.

609
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,579
We've got to drop the attitude

610
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,580
and just be cool.

611
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,205
>> I'm not going to try to talk

612
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,957
to them, any of them.

613
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,167
>> You know, obviously, we're in

614
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,377
a desperate position.

615
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,337
We're three people.

616
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,254
You guys were five.

617
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,797
So, you know that if you, you

618
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,174
know, if you have any kind of

619
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,800
idea, if you'd like to work with

620
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,344
us in any way, we're certainly

621
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,011
open to it.

622
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,054
>> You're on the outs.

623
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,848
The final three in this game is

624
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:35,100
Kenny, Susie, and Crystal.

625
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,186
Matty's got two ways to play.

626
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,103
He can stay with the original

627
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,439
Fang and go to the finals that

628
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,982
way, or he can come with me and

629
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,651
Corinne and Bob and have a shot

630
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,278
at winning.

631
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,531
>> It's nothing to be ashamed

632
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,618
of.

633
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,294
>> I just arrived at Exile.

634
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,172
I'm going to go for the clue for

635
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,465
the immunity idol, and that's a

636
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,051
real clear choice for me.

637
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,095
The next couple Tribals, there's

638
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,888
a very tight group that are

639
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:16,141
going to vote Corinne, Randy,

640
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,852
and myself off.

641
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,396
"Across the lake you see so

642
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,064
well, there lies a sandy crater.

643
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,565
The object hidden in its floor

644
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,651
will surely help you later."

645
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,653
Oh, damn.

646
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,613
I realized the extra clue I got

647
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,615
this time was a clue that I'd

648
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,908
already found on my own last

649
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:34,618
time.

650
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,244
I was a little depressed, but I

651
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,246
got a lot of time here, and what

652
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,998
I'm going to do is, I'm going to

653
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,208
go for my own little safari.

654
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,751
I just think that will be more

655
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,253
rewarding for me than aimlessly

656
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,255
looking around for an idol.

657
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,924
♪ ♪

658
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,974
When I came to Africa, I came

659
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,225
here to experience not only

660
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,437
<i>Survivor,</i> but to sort of learn

661
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,480
about myself, to really think

662
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,816
about how lucky a person I am,

663
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,110
what a wonderful family I have.

664
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,069
It takes your breath away.

665
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,113
And what a beautiful place

666
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,199
Africa is.

667
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,868
I see why they call it the

668
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:19,038
Garden of Eden.

669
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,306
>> Trying?

670
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:37,514
Trying?

671
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,184
>> Are you even gonna try?

672
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,185
>> Okay, I'm coming.

673
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,478
I'm going to sit down and

674
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,270
express.

675
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:43,562
>> Express?

676
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,313
(overlapping chatter)

677
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,273
>> Okay, you guys, we're getting

678
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,566
down to a point where it's

679
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:48,567
pretty dicey for us.

680
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,443
>> Yeah.

681
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,736
>> Okay, so, we-we got to keep

682
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,070
the five of us strong, right?

683
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:52,821
>> Yes.

684
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,572
>> Yes.

685
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,573
>> Randy.

686
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,574
Obviously, it's a no-brainer.

687
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:56,617
He's set himself up.

688
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,659
He's made his own coffin.

689
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,660
>> Yes...

690
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,620
>> But...

691
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:00,412
>> But?

692
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,789
>> Bob should go next just to

693
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,332
get him out of the loop, so he

694
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,374
doesn't win immunities and end

695
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,125
our five-some up.

696
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,418
Randy's not going to win any

697
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,211
challenges.

698
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,504
Corinne's not going to win any

699
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,213
challenges.

700
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,506
Bringing them in to the final

701
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,799
final six, final seven is way

702
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:12,549
safer for us.

703
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,593
I think Bob should go next.

704
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:15,844
>> I'm noticing now that Matty

705
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,137
is really playing the game and

706
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,056
that he is trying to take

707
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,349
control, and that he is a

708
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,391
physical threat, and he's trying

709
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,184
to get rid of Bob, who is the

710
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,352
other physical threat, and hang

711
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,729
on to Randy for some reason.

712
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:26,355
Is he going to join up with

713
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,148
Randy 'cause he's wizening up

714
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,691
and know that it's smart to have

715
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,734
a jerk at the end?

716
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,277
>> We got to have a plan, so it

717
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,320
it has to be Bob.

718
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:33,529
>> Okay.

719
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,405
>> It has to be Randy, then

720
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,156
Corinne.

721
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:36,573
Bob, Randy, Corinne.

722
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,033
>> Okay.

723
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:38,575
>> That's the order.

724
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,535
>> Then we're down to the four.

725
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,327
>> It sucks.

726
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,329
>> I know it sucks, but stop...

727
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:45,040
>> Hello!

728
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,626
>> Okay, fine.

729
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:48,627
>> Here he is.

730
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,211
Here-Here he comes.

731
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,212
Here he comes.

732
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,213
Bob, Randy, Corinne.

733
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,172
Bob, Randy, Corinne.

734
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:56,510
>> I know.

735
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,244
>> Good morning, sunshine.

736
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,621
>> What you got for me?

737
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:25,873
>> FYI, I'm crashing and burning

738
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,165
today.

739
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,417
>> I love this.

740
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,918
>> I stayed up all night just

741
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,712
thinking of the most diabolical

742
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,006
thing that we could do to keep

743
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,757
us in the game and get the worst

744
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,467
person in this game out.

745
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,220
Corinne, myself, and Bob are on

746
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,221
the outside.

747
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,598
Our only chance is to shake

748
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,557
things up.

749
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,975
I'm going to be crashing and

750
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,059
burning all day, make everybody

751
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:46,560
miserable, showing these

752
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:50,022
morons...

753
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,106
Just putting them in their

754
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:51,857
place.

755
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,400
The plan is for me to act really

756
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,068
nasty, continue to mix it up

757
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:55,694
with everybody, and the old Fang

758
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,405
people are going to vote for me.

759
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,449
Our only prayer is if Bob would

760
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,617
give me the idol.

761
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,160
>> This is a good idea.

762
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:06,079
>> Everyone vote me out.

763
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,123
I spring the idol out at Tribal.

764
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:09,333
Susie is three votes, and goes

765
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,334
home.

766
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:10,667
>> I love it.

767
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,294
>> It's our only prayer.

768
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,253
>> That's a great plan.

769
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,630
>> We get the feeling that Bob

770
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,131
probably found the immunity

771
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:17,799
idol, and the plan is to

772
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,259
convince Bob to give me the

773
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,970
hidden immunity idol.

774
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:22,304
I play the idol.

775
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,306
Voilà-- Susie, joke's on you.

776
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,682
You're going home.

777
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,059
>> So, think about it, enjoy the

778
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,060
thought. Yeah.

779
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:28,644
>> I don't need to think about

780
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,353
it.

781
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,270
I'm-I'm totally on board.

782
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,314
I'm going to talk to Bob...

783
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,857
>> I mean, it buys us three more

784
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:34,900
days, and something new could

785
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:35,651
happen.

786
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,735
>> I will talk to Bob.

787
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:37,444
Let me see if I can get Bob on

788
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,237
board.

789
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,030
>> You like it?

790
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:40,864
>> I love it.

791
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:41,490
>> I not only want Susie to go

792
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,492
home, but I want to blindside

793
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,368
her.

794
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,827
The reason that myself and

795
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:46,411
Corinne and Bob are in the

796
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,206
predicament we are in is because

797
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,582
Susie flipped.

798
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,459
She went with Crystal and Kenny,

799
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,502
and they voted Marcus out.

800
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,129
That's part of the game, but the

801
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,130
hell with her.

802
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,423
Uh, this would be sweet, sweet

803
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:06,014
revenge.

804
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,140
(Randy imitates yawning)

805
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,392
>> Why do you have to tell the

806
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:11,019
world?

807
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,319
>> There's not a...

808
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,362
There's not a normal person

809
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,738
among them, except you, and you

810
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:22,739
even... even whored yourself

811
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:23,907
out.

812
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:24,908
>> Oh, my God.

813
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,702
Don't do this, dude.

814
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,662
Don't.

815
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:29,663
>> You know you have.

816
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,123
You know, I don't blame you.

817
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,374
It's worth a million dollars to

818
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,417
you.

819
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,418
It's not to me.

820
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,420
>> Oh, my God.

821
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,296
Randy just sealed his fate, you

822
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,464
know.

823
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,757
I've done what I can.

824
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,217
And if you're not going to

825
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,802
listen to what I have to say or

826
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,303
take my advice, then, I mean,

827
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,346
there's nothing I can do.

828
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,723
It's a no-brainer that Randy

829
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,473
has to go home now, and he's

830
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,517
going out with a bang.

831
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,560
>> Guess how many of those

832
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,561
cookies I ate?

833
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:53,562
>> Those freaking cookies.

834
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,605
>> I was in charge of every

835
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:56,815
single one of them, but I didn't

836
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:57,816
get any.

837
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,401
It-it was for the tribe, and I

838
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,819
could do anything-- I could put

839
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,487
it in the dirt and stomp on it,

840
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,488
if I wanted to.

841
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,781
>> I got the impression that you

842
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,116
really didn't want to give it...

843
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,117
>> To anybody.

844
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,160
>> I'm tired of this story.

845
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,202
>> Thank you.

846
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,162
>> You're right.

847
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,163
I'm done.

848
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,539
>> Then shut the (bleep) up.

849
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:13,582
>> I can talk when I want.

850
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,584
>> Randy got to go.

851
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,586
Randy needs to go.

852
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,088
He is a troll.

853
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,132
He is wreaking havoc in the

854
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,134
Nobag tribe.

855
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:24,551
>> That man.

856
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,470
>> He's going home.

857
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,555
>> Oh, yeah, doesn't matter.

858
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,480
>> I like where I'm sitting

859
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,273
right now.

860
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:38,774
They're all freaking out.

861
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,276
And that's a real good thing.

862
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,652
The more they freak out, the

863
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,321
more paranoia sets, the more

864
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,114
Operation Strong-arm can be

865
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,115
effective.

866
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,617
Man, we've still got an immunity

867
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,702
challenge to play.

868
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,216
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

869
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,016
We'll now bring in Bob returning

870
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,102
from Exile Island.

871
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,439
>> How's it going, Bob?

872
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:22,818
>> Good morning, gang.

873
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,111
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

874
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,153
to today's immunity challenge?

875
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,113
>> Yes.

876
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,114
>> PROBST: First things first--

877
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:30,117
take back the necklace, Susie.

878
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,202
>> Thank you.

879
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,872
>> PROBST: Once again, immunity

880
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,874
is back up for grabs.

881
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,876
For today's challenge, you will

882
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,462
race across a series of balance

883
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,547
beams carrying a bag of puzzle

884
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,507
blocks.

885
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,884
When you reach the finish,

886
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,177
you'll head back to the start,

887
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,178
do it again.

888
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,763
The first two people to get

889
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:52,597
their three bags across the

890
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,600
line move on to the final round.

891
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,270
In the final round, you will

892
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,980
empty your bags filled with

893
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,189
puzzle blocks.

894
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:01,773
You must arrange those puzzle

895
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,483
blocks along a multi-angled

896
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,486
platform while avoiding trip

897
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,487
wires which could tip your

898
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,990
blocks, forcing you to start

899
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:10,991
over.

900
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:11,992
>> Mmm.

901
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,034
>> PROBST: Your goal is to

902
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:13,660
arrange your blocks so they will

903
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:16,413
fall one into another like

904
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:19,416
dominoes, raising a flag.

905
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,334
First person to raise their flag

906
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,544
wins immunity, is guaranteed a

907
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,922
one-in-seven shot at winning

908
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,966
this game and a million dollars.

909
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,342
Losers, Tribal Council.

910
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,136
Somebody will be voted out.

911
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:31,720
Corinne, at the auction, you

912
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,139
bought an advantage in today's

913
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,348
immunity challenge.

914
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,349
You have the bottle?

915
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:39,144
>> Please be something magical.

916
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,353
This is good.

917
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,646
"You will sit out for the first

918
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,689
stage of this challenge and

919
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:43,732
move directly into the final

920
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:44,733
round."

921
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:45,734
>> PROBST: Huge advantage in

922
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:46,735
this challenge.

923
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:47,736
>> Thank you!

924
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:48,570
>> PROBST: Corinne is now

925
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:49,154
guaranteed a one-in-three shot

926
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:49,738
at winning this challenge and

927
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,573
staying alive in this game.

928
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,866
Corinne gets to sit out the

929
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:53,867
first round.

930
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:54,659
Everybody else, we'll get

931
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,745
started.

932
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:58,955
Here we go.

933
00:24:59,039 --> 00:24:59,581
For immunity, first two people

934
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,042
to finish move on to the final

935
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,043
round.

936
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,044
Survivors, ready?

937
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:06,129
Go!

938
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,385
Matty off to a quick start.

939
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,970
Matty doesn't hesitate, has his

940
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,180
first bag across.

941
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,390
Kenny has his first bag across.

942
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,768
It is Matty and Kenny.

943
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,561
Bob is across.

944
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:22,979
Susie's across.

945
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,022
Matty across with his second

946
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,023
bag.

947
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,608
Sugar, no good, gotta go back.

948
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,485
Here comes Kenny with his second

949
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:29,486
bag.

950
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,654
Matty's got his final bag.

951
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,489
Susie with her second bag.

952
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:33,990
Kenny makes it with his second

953
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,992
bag.

954
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,994
Bob falls off, no good.

955
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:38,995
Gotta go back.

956
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,580
Matty's across with three bags.

957
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,624
Matty's moving on.

958
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,418
Susie has her second bag.

959
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,419
>> Damn it!

960
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,420
>> PROBST: Sugar and Crystal

961
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,421
fall.

962
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,215
One spot left to get to the

963
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,216
final round.

964
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,842
Who's going to get it?

965
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,011
Kenny with a big leap.

966
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,013
Kenny moves on to the final.

967
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:57,764
It is Kenny, Matty, and Corinne

968
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,850
in the final round.

969
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,899
All right, in the final round,

970
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:11,528
Kenny, Matty, Corinne.

971
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:14,614
For immunity, survivors, ready?

972
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,827
Go!

973
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,828
Your job is to arrange those

974
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,622
puzzle blocks like a nice line

975
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,416
of dominoes.

976
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:27,460
Matty, Corinne, starting at the

977
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,422
front.

978
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,424
Kenny moving to the end, working

979
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:32,924
his way backwards, three

980
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,844
different strategies.

981
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,346
Where this challenge gets tricky

982
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:38,847
is when you have to start

983
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,266
maneuvering with those trip

984
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,268
ropes.

985
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,270
One wrong move on those trip

986
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,480
ropes could knock over

987
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:51,276
everything you've built so far.

988
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:51,818
Corinne making a lot of

989
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,820
progress.

990
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,197
Matty seems to have the early

991
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,991
lead.

992
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:01,077
Corinne taking her time.

993
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,830
Kenny's pieces go down.

994
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,832
Kenny may have made it more

995
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:09,461
difficult, starting at the end.

996
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,046
Matty very close to knocking

997
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:14,049
everything over.

998
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:14,883
Kenny picking up his fallen

999
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,968
pieces.

1000
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,973
Corinne making a lot of

1001
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,600
progress.

1002
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:24,976
Question is: have you spaced

1003
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,604
them properly?

1004
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,189
Matty has a bit of a lead if

1005
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,398
he's right.

1006
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,192
Corinne still in it.

1007
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,194
Kenny and Matty arranging their

1008
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:34,819
last pieces.

1009
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,781
Matty has two blocks left.

1010
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,407
If he's wrong, it's a lot of

1011
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,617
work for nothing.

1012
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,411
Kenny gathering his last blocks.

1013
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,413
Kenny coming on strong now.

1014
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:45,914
Suddenly, Kenny's nearly

1015
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,832
complete.

1016
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,793
Everybody's still in this

1017
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,211
challenge.

1018
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,420
>> Jeff, I got it.

1019
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,463
>> PROBST: Kenny's going to give

1020
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:54,464
it a shot.

1021
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:57,300
>> Push it?

1022
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,259
>> PROBST: Push it.

1023
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,260
>> Come on!

1024
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,261
Go! Go!

1025
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,304
>> PROBST: Kenny's doesn't work.

1026
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:02,597
He's got to rearrange it.

1027
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,723
Matty now heading back.

1028
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,350
Do not panic!

1029
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,143
Take your time!

1030
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,562
Corinne now looking good.

1031
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,940
Corinne, by being calm, has kept

1032
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,733
herself in this challenge.

1033
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:14,776
Matty has placed all his blocks.

1034
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,320
Is he ready to give it a try?

1035
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:17,946
>> Ready to give it a try, Jeff!

1036
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:18,738
>> All right, I'm going to try

1037
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,739
it again, Jeff.

1038
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:20,782
>> PROBST: Kenny's ready to give

1039
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:21,783
another shot.

1040
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:22,784
>> I'm trying it, Jeff.

1041
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:23,827
>> PROBST: Corinne is now going.

1042
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,787
Matty's in on it.

1043
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,415
This is it right here.

1044
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,417
Everybody has their blocks

1045
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,418
moving.

1046
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,420
Who is going to finish first?

1047
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,213
Matty's halfway through.

1048
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:35,839
Kenny's looking good.

1049
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,841
Million dollars on the line.

1050
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,884
Does it go, Corinne?

1051
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:40,885
>> Almost.

1052
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,054
Oh! Oh!

1053
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,431
Oh!

1054
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,432
>> PROBST: No, Corinne's stopped

1055
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,434
short.

1056
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,811
Matty's doesn't go.

1057
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,896
>> Go! Go! Go!

1058
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,860
>> PROBST: Kenny wins immunity!

1059
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,575
Kenny, come on over.

1060
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:08,872
Congratulations.

1061
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,623
With this around your neck, you

1062
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,666
are safe at tonight's Tribal

1063
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:12,667
Council.

1064
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,210
As for the rest of you, after 30

1065
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:14,836
days, this game will come to an

1066
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:15,920
end for one of you.

1067
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:16,963
Grab your stuff.

1068
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:17,964
Head back to camp.

1069
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,008
I will see you at Tribal.

1070
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,009
Congratulations.

1071
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,011
>> Randy and I needed to win.

1072
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:23,845
Now, I'm going on a wing and a

1073
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:24,846
prayer that Bob has the idol.

1074
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,931
I just need to figure out if he

1075
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:27,932
has it or not.

1076
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,018
I was so close.

1077
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,943
♪ ♪

1078
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:47,827
>> I can't believe it.

1079
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:48,077
>> I can.

1080
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,662
It's awesome!

1081
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:50,830
>> Hey, Kenny, good job.

1082
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,040
Very good job.

1083
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,082
>> Yeah, thanks, guys.

1084
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,501
>> Good job, bro.

1085
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:55,877
>> Matty was like so close, too.

1086
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,505
That was insane.

1087
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,508
>> I am 75% sure that I need the

1088
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,343
idol tonight because they're

1089
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:03,927
going to vote for me.

1090
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,054
Ideally, tonight, Bob gives me

1091
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:09,182
the idol, and whoever Corinne,

1092
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,309
Bob, and I decide to send home

1093
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,102
will be going home.

1094
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:18,149
Right now, it looks like Susie.

1095
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,192
>> Okay.

1096
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,735
Well, I... that's what I kind of

1097
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:21,152
feel like now, too.

1098
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,029
>> I really would feel guilty if

1099
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,322
Bob went home and I stayed.

1100
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,325
But if he even semi-offers it,

1101
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:30,411
I'm going to take it.

1102
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,082
>> I know you guys aren't going

1103
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,251
to believe me if I tell you I

1104
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,252
don't have the idol.

1105
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,253
And you-you have to...

1106
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,254
>> It wouldn't matter.

1107
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,296
I do believe you.

1108
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,548
I have your best interests in

1109
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,549
mind.

1110
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,758
Um, you can vote for whoever you

1111
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:45,552
want, but it might behoove you

1112
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,011
to vote against Randy.

1113
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,221
>> We don't need him here.

1114
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,222
>> Yeah, I know.

1115
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,765
And it might buy you some time,

1116
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:52,016
and if it doesn't buy you some

1117
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,018
time, I got another plan.

1118
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,521
Randy is an ass, and I loathe

1119
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,523
him with every inch of my being.

1120
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,524
>> Thanks, sweetie. Bye.

1121
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:00,525
>> Bye.

1122
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,526
The guy is a bigot.

1123
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:02,026
He offends everyone.

1124
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,195
And maybe that's his game, but

1125
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,613
I'm not even worried about that

1126
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,198
because Randy's gone.

1127
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:10,952
You didn't tell anybody that

1128
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,121
you didn't find it, right?

1129
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,916
I think that Randy would fall

1130
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,085
for it.

1131
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:20,503
Your idol.

1132
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,505
>> If I give him the fake one?

1133
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,757
>> And it... it would be

1134
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:25,717
hilarious.

1135
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,301
>> If you think he'd fall for

1136
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,094
it, but I just, you know...

1137
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,095
>> Yeah, don't worry.

1138
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,597
>> If we figure out a way for me

1139
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,180
to give it to Randy, I will do

1140
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,098
that.

1141
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,933
Sugar wants to play the joke on

1142
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,143
Randy.

1143
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,770
My life expectancy is a little

1144
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,355
bit better off allowing her to

1145
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,898
have the satisfaction of me

1146
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,108
giving Randy the-the idol.

1147
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,277
I've got nothing to lose.

1148
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,028
It's not a real idol.

1149
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:47,196
I can't save myself with it.

1150
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,740
The only way I can save myself

1151
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:49,949
for another Tribal Council is by

1152
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,160
convincing somebody else to use

1153
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,746
it, and I think it should do the

1154
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:57,832
trick.

1155
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:00,460
>> I want to run through the

1156
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,169
options with you.

1157
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,421
Okay, obviously, the only Hail

1158
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,881
Mary we've got is the idol,

1159
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,424
which I assume you found.

1160
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:07,425
Okay.

1161
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:08,718
And you know you cannot tell

1162
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:09,344
anybody you found the idol, at

1163
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,011
all.

1164
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,055
Other than me or Randy, you

1165
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,056
cannot trust anybody, especially

1166
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,098
not Sugar.

1167
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,099
Obviously, if you found the

1168
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:15,683
idol, the smartest strategy

1169
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,101
would be to give it to Randy

1170
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:17,685
if you thought that Randy was

1171
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,895
getting voted out 'cause it

1172
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:19,646
would save us.

1173
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,813
>> If at the end of the day, I

1174
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:21,606
think they're going to go for

1175
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,607
Randy...

1176
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,650
>> You're going to give it for

1177
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:24,609
Randy.

1178
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:25,652
>> I'm going to give it to Randy

1179
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:26,611
and the three of us vote for

1180
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:27,612
Susie.

1181
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:28,404
>> Yeah, no matter what, the

1182
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,238
three of us vote for Susie.

1183
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:29,530
I love you.

1184
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,907
Thank you for coming back.

1185
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:31,741
And thank you for finding the

1186
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,826
idol.

1187
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,168
>> That was...

1188
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,591
>> I'm trying to figure out

1189
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,677
what to do.

1190
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,515
What I'm thinking is you've

1191
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,934
pissed everybody off so much...

1192
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,143
>> I'm going tonight.

1193
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,271
>> If I gave you that idol...

1194
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,067
>> Bob has not only told me that

1195
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,444
he has the idol, but he showed

1196
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,487
it to me.

1197
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:09,737
I saw it.

1198
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,739
It was two feet away from me.

1199
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:12,281
I am thrilled that Bob found

1200
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:13,116
the idol.

1201
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,284
I'm especially thrilled that

1202
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,494
he's willing to give it over to

1203
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:19,831
me.

1204
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:22,500
>> The hit is on Susie.

1205
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,710
>> Susie, yeah.

1206
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:24,335
>> Make sure Corinne and-and...

1207
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,838
all I can offer you now is, if

1208
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:27,422
you're in the finals and I'm

1209
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,257
not, you got my vote for a

1210
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:29,507
million.

1211
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,843
>> Save some starch for me when

1212
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,886
we...

1213
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,972
>> It's a deal.

1214
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,807
We got word that the hit is on,

1215
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,727
on me tonight, so Bob did one of

1216
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,478
the most, uh, selfless acts I've

1217
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,897
ever seen, which was, uh, to

1218
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,107
give me his hidden immunity

1219
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:46,315
idol.

1220
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,150
There is going to be some

1221
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,067
surprised people tonight, I

1222
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,235
think, and I'm here for three

1223
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,028
more days.

1224
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,239
Looks like an idol to me.

1225
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,742
>> You're a genius.

1226
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,410
I cannot believe you did that.

1227
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,871
I cannot wait to see this.

1228
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:00,913
You are awesome.

1229
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:01,164
Thank you.

1230
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:03,082
>> Make it worth my while.

1231
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,167
>> Oh, I will.

1232
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:04,459
Don't worry.

1233
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,294
I'm making it worth your while.

1234
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,004
You kick butt, dude.

1235
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,338
(laughing)

1236
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,042
>> PROBST: I'll now bring in the

1237
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:50,213
members of our jury.

1238
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,799
Marcus and Charlie, voted out

1239
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,718
at the last Tribal Council.

1240
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,934
Let's start with the auction.

1241
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,435
It ended with what should have

1242
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,520
been a happy note.

1243
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,854
Randy buys a plate of chocolate

1244
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,773
chip cookies for the tribe, but

1245
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,525
it didn't go down so smoothly.

1246
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:11,818
Sugar, what was your take on

1247
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,069
how it all played out?

1248
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,570
>> Well, Randy offered me his

1249
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,780
last cookie, which I wasn't

1250
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:16,823
really thinking about it being

1251
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:17,532
his last cookie.

1252
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,741
I just thought that they were

1253
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,910
for the tribe, and so I took it,

1254
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:21,494
and I gave it to Matty, and

1255
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:22,370
we've heard about it for three

1256
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,371
days.

1257
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,289
>> PROBST: Randy, looking back

1258
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,290
on your actions, did you play it

1259
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,959
the right way?

1260
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:28,793
Was that appropriate?

1261
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:29,377
>> It wasn't the last cookie.

1262
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,420
It was my cookie.

1263
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,089
And honestly, I was testing her.

1264
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,173
I could have thrown them on the

1265
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,383
ground and stomped on them if I

1266
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,300
wanted to, or I could have been

1267
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,136
generous like I was.

1268
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:39,720
>> PROBST: So you think their

1269
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,430
reaction was maybe a little

1270
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,598
harsh because you did offer

1271
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,724
everybody a cookie?

1272
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,560
>> Yes, and I even offered Sugar

1273
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,103
one twice.

1274
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,396
>> It's freaking cookies.

1275
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,064
My God, we're grown-ups.

1276
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:51,440
It's stupid.

1277
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,276
>> PROBST: Susie, why is this

1278
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,902
seemingly funny story about a

1279
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,863
cookie so representative of this

1280
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:57,947
game?

1281
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,156
>> You're really getting to know

1282
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,366
people's true colors and what

1283
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:01,284
they're really like 'cause I

1284
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:01,826
have actually questioned,

1285
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:02,410
thinking, "God, you know, is

1286
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:05,496
Randy really like this?"

1287
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,123
He's actually probably a person

1288
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:07,582
that's really hurting.

1289
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,417
I feel kind of sorry for him

1290
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,418
because he probably is very sad.

1291
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,879
>> You know, actually, saying "I

1292
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,422
feel sorry" for somebody is

1293
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,799
another way of saying, "How

1294
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,301
pathetic."

1295
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:19,677
>> Oh, my apologies.

1296
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,720
I don't mean it that way.

1297
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,221
>> And I was totally sincere

1298
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,472
with the cookie, too.

1299
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,057
I swear I was.

1300
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:25,600
That's why I went off today.

1301
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,602
So...

1302
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,103
>> PROBST: Corinne, it sounds

1303
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:30,187
like something happened at camp

1304
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:30,938
today.

1305
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,064
Randy says he went off.

1306
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:32,732
What happened?

1307
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:33,816
>> I don't even know what

1308
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,318
started it, but all of a sudden,

1309
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,904
I hear something to the effect

1310
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,364
of, "Shut up," directed from

1311
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,991
Randy at Susie.

1312
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,618
And it's a very awkward thing

1313
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:44,410
to be sitting through.

1314
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,662
>> PROBST: Crystal, can you feel

1315
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,372
the tension ramping up as we get

1316
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,708
into the very tail end of this

1317
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:51,334
game?

1318
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,543
>> I sure can feel the tension

1319
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,461
ramping up.

1320
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,212
Like, for instance, the cookie

1321
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,881
conversation that exploded into

1322
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,008
a blatant disrespect to a grown

1323
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,259
woman... to me, under any other

1324
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,053
circumstances, that's hands down

1325
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,179
for a slap.

1326
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,263
>> PROBST: Is there any chance

1327
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,474
that Randy's playing some sort

1328
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,892
of game?

1329
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,685
>> If-if... if this is him, then

1330
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,812
he's giving it to me raw.

1331
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,814
And I will never talk to him

1332
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:14,315
outside of this situation.

1333
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,901
But if this is his game and no

1334
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,486
one's going to possibly reject

1335
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,780
me and I'm going to get to the

1336
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,908
end, then that's his game.

1337
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,409
>> PROBST: Bob, let's talk about

1338
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,203
your second trip to Exile

1339
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:27,453
Island.

1340
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:30,206
Is anybody brave enough to bring

1341
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:30,790
up the notion of the hidden

1342
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,458
immunity idol?

1343
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,418
>> Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.

1344
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,213
I made a point of not letting

1345
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,923
people know for sure whether I

1346
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:39,465
had it or I didn't have it

1347
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,968
because it's part of the game.

1348
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,971
And I'm here to play.

1349
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:45,596
>> PROBST: Randy, I know you're

1350
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,473
worried every time you come to

1351
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:48,808
Tribal, but with so much

1352
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,060
animosity directed toward you,

1353
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,728
how worried are you tonight?

1354
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:53,354
>> You're wrong about one thing.

1355
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,355
I haven't been worried every

1356
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,273
time I come to Tribal.

1357
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,566
And I am a bit worried tonight,

1358
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,067
though.

1359
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,235
You're right about that.

1360
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,569
But 30 days is a pretty good

1361
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:01,654
run.

1362
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,030
>> PROBST: So, if it's you

1363
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,865
tonight, you're okay with that?

1364
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,659
>> No, I would not be okay with

1365
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:07,493
leaving.

1366
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,955
I want to stay.

1367
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,415
>> PROBST: With that, it is time

1368
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,749
to get to the vote.

1369
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,042
Kenny, you have the individual

1370
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,002
immunity necklace.

1371
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,128
You can keep it for yourself or

1372
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,045
give it to somebody else.

1373
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,755
>> I will keep it tonight, Jeff.

1374
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,132
>> PROBST: You cannot vote for

1375
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:21,716
Kenny.

1376
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:22,883
Everybody else is fair game.

1377
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,010
It is time to vote.

1378
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:27,388
Matty, you're up.

1379
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,608
>> I'm voting you, Susie,

1380
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,028
'cause payback's a bitch.

1381
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:53,497
>> You are a disgusting, old,

1382
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,583
hotheaded, chauvinistic,

1383
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:59,378
alcoholic bigot, and you need to

1384
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,757
grow up before you die alone.

1385
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,926
And a loser.

1386
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,437
>> This vote is not strategic.

1387
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,814
It's strictly personal.

1388
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,574
>> (loudly): You have made my

1389
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:31,494
life hell from day one!

1390
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:34,038
Forget you!

1391
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,706
Go home!

1392
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,667
Good-bye.

1393
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,343
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1394
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:49,970
votes.

1395
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,149
If anybody has the hidden

1396
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:02,775
immunity idol and you want to

1397
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,568
play it, now would be the time

1398
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,071
to do so.

1399
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,711
>> PROBST: Thank you.

1400
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,138
The rules of<i> Survivor</i> state that

1401
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,098
if a hidden immunity idol is

1402
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,267
played, then the votes cast

1403
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,185
against that person will not

1404
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:38,769
count, and the person with the

1405
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,855
next highest number of votes

1406
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,607
will be voted out.

1407
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:49,697
This is not a hidden immunity

1408
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,323
idol.

1409
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:54,243
(laughing)

1410
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,747
All votes cast against Randy

1411
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,916
will count.

1412
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,339
I'll now read the votes.

1413
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:14,388
First vote... Randy.

1414
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,809
Randy-- two votes Randy.

1415
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:25,441
Susie.

1416
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,695
Susie.

1417
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,197
Two votes Randy;

1418
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,073
two votes Susie.

1419
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:35,826
That's three votes Susie;

1420
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:39,246
two votes Randy.

1421
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,708
Randy.

1422
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:43,834
That's three votes Randy;

1423
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,794
three votes Susie.

1424
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:49,757
Randy.

1425
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,091
That's four votes Randy;

1426
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,426
three votes Susie.

1427
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:55,054
One vote left.

1428
00:41:58,515 --> 00:41:59,600
11th person voted out of

00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,935

member of our jury: Randy.

1431
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:05,564
Need to bring me your torch.

1432
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,491
Randy, the tribe has spoken.

1433
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:20,663
Time for you to go.

1434
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,006
Well, after tonight's Tribal

1435
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,841
Council, it's very clear this

1436
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,218
game is coming down to one

1437
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,803
thing: trust.

1438
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,596
Can't wait to see how it plays

1439
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,264
out.

1440
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,265
Grab your torches.

1441
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,266
Head back to camp.

1442
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,268
Good night.

bozos is probably one of the

best accolades anyone could get.

1456
