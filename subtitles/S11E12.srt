>> JEFF PROBST: Previously

2
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:04,546
on<i> Survivor:</i> Gary tried to lure

3
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:05,672
Lydia away from the Alliance of

4
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:09,217
Five.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,051
>> But Judd was listening in.

6
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,761
>> I hear Gary working all over

7
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,305
Lydia, man.

8
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:15,432
Her eyes are bulging out of her

9
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:16,391
head.

10
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:21,271
"Yeah, Gary."

11
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,856
>> I have to cover my own ass,

12
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:23,481
so if somebody approach me with

13
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,191
a better deal, I'm going with

14
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,317
it.

15
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,402
>> JEFF: At the reward

16
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:28,611
challenge, the shift in loyalty

17
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:29,195
was exposed when Lydia helped

18
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,281
remove Stephenie from the game.

19
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,366
Steph not happy at all with

20
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:33,658
that, Lydia.

21
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,160
>> I haven't eaten.

22
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,911
Steph ate three times.

23
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:37,662
>> So did Gary.

24
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:38,204
So did Danni.

25
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,080
>> JEFF: And Cindy smashed her

26
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,458
way to victory.

27
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,584
>> Cindy!

28
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:43,126
>> JEFF: Cindy chose Rafe to

29
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,670
join her on the hot springs

30
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:46,296
waterfall reward.

31
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,881
>> You know, Cindy and I are

32
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:48,465
kind of in this together for

33
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,341
better or for worse.

34
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,469
This was, like, the best day.

35
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,345
>> JEFF: Back at camp, with

36
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,680
Lydia on board, Gary and Danni

37
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,557
concocted a plan to approach

38
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,266
Rafe to join them in an

39
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:04,105
alliance.

40
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:04,814
>> JEFF: But Danni was

41
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:05,315
strategically keeping her

42
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,233
options open.

43
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,193
>> I've got to look at who is in

44
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:08,818
control of the game and play up

45
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,946
to it 'cause I'm not going to

46
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,238
go home.

47
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,449
>> JEFF: At the immunity

48
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:15,617
challenge, Gary and Rafe were

49
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,785
neck and neck, but it was Rafe

50
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,787
who won immunity.

51
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,165
Once again, Rafe wins immunity!

52
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,083
Before Tribal Council, Gary had

53
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,919
the opportunity to make his move

54
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:35,887
with Rafe.

55
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:36,846
>> Rafe told me that he didn't

56
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,723
trust Judd, so at some point,

57
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:39,682
they're going to turn on each

58
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,727
other.

59
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:43,978
>> At Tribal Council, Gary

60
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,522
exposed Judd's lie about the

61
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,189
hidden idol.

62
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,899
>> He goes, "Okay, I'll tell

63
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:48,066
you.

64
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,525
It's on the ground."

65
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,984
Well, I followed them out in

66
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,361
the woods the next day, and the

67
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,112
idol was in the tree.

68
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:53,613
>> JEFF: You got caught.

69
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,990
You got outed tonight for lying.

70
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:56,866
>> Okay, all right.

71
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,992
I lied about the damn idol.

72
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,035
>> JEFF: But despite Gary's

73
00:01:59,118 --> 00:01:59,661
efforts, his tribe considered

74
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,371
him too much of a threat.

75
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,123
Rafe stuck with his alliance,

76
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:04,749
and even Danni and Lydia helped

77
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,877
vote Gary out.

78
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,420
Six are left.

79
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:17,595
Who will be voted out tonight?

82
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,466
>> Well, last night at Tribal

83
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,967
Council, Gary got voted out,

84
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,469
and, uh, now that there's six of

85
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,470
us left, I'm next on the totem

86
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,889
pole, you know?

87
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,140
About ready to have my head

88
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:47,060
chopped off.

89
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:47,852
>> I was awake.

90
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,146
I was not delirious or anything,

91
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:50,855
dreaming.

92
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,815
I smelled sausage and eggs.

93
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,233
I really did.

94
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,026
>> Well, if you smelled bacon

95
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,319
and eggs or sausage and eggs,

96
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,362
Lyd, it's probably, uh, Steph

97
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,321
farting again.

98
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,572
So that could be a little bit of

99
00:03:59,656 --> 00:03:59,822
a problem.

100
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,491
>> No, I went to the bathroom.

101
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,408
No more gas.

102
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,451
>> You know, usually when you

103
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,745
got, like, that egg smell...

104
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,580
>> Egg smell.

105
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,039
>> First thing in the

106
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:11,417
morning, they're not eggs, man.

107
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,127
>> It's funny how everybody

108
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,337
tries to play it off like

109
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,505
nothing happened when we just

110
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,090
had this heated Tribal Council

111
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,634
last night, you know, how

112
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,135
there's been a lot of lying.

113
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,553
And I think it's 'cause they're

114
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:23,429
all scared.

115
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,055
I mean, after everything's been

116
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:24,681
called out into the open, I just

117
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,724
kind of sit back last night, and

118
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:27,475
I'm like, "These people are

119
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:30,228
unbelievable."

120
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:30,853
I have a feeling who's going to

121
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:35,483
win this one.

122
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,359
>> Style.

123
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,443
>> That's your style, right?

124
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,987
You're up.

125
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,615
>> Is it my turn?

126
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:42,824
>> Oh!

127
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,826
>> Wow!

128
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:45,952
>> Whoo!

129
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:46,536
>> Spunky.

130
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,453
>> That was pretty, man.

131
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,871
>> I think Judd's was better.

132
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:49,497
>> I'm definitely not going to

133
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,999
go down without a fight.

134
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,083
>> I mean, I'm going to work

135
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:52,834
something out.

136
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,168
I mean, I know Lydia-- she feels

137
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,254
like she's on the outs now with

138
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:56,879
this group, and so I know she's

139
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,007
definitely in with me.

140
00:04:59,090 --> 00:04:59,966
And I think it would take one

141
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,343
more person, um, maybe, to-to

142
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,511
throw something.

143
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,513
Ooh, my shoe.

144
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:06,639
(grunts)

145
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,141
This perfect little alliance is

146
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,267
going to have to start breaking

147
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,684
up.

148
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:10,351
It's going to have to start

149
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,061
attacking each other.

150
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,146
I mean, they-they can't all go

151
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,272
to the final spot.

152
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,023
I mean, it's just not going to

153
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:15,356
happen.

154
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,066
>> Ooh!

155
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:17,859
>> I thought were going to do a

156
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:18,109
back flip.

157
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,193
>> Wow.

158
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:19,777
>> That was beautiful, Danni.

159
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:20,945
>> Thank you, thank you.

160
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:30,246
I'm seeing stars.

161
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:33,082
>> JEFF: Come on in, guys.

162
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:33,958
Go ahead and take a spot on the

163
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,835
bench.

164
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,921

You each have $500 US.

168

Sharing of money is allowed, but

only the two people who pool

The auction will end without

If you see something you like,

177
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,273
you should bid on it.

178
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:57,899
Make sense?

179
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:58,816
>> Yes.

180
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,194
>> JEFF: Get to the first item.

181
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,029
A plate of beef jerky.

182
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:03,738
>> Oh.

183
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:04,489
>> JEFF: A little protein.

184
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,406
>> Twenty.

for 20.

187
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,618
Steph, not even interested.

188
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:09,952
Nobody else wants this?

189
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,746
Going once.

190
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,581
Going twice.

191
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,875
Sold to Danni for 20 bucks.

192
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,001
Pretty good bargain at 20 bucks,

Whether or not it is enough to

322
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:00,706
make sure you win depends on how

323
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,793
you use it, but if you think you

324
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:04,669
are in trouble, this is worth

325
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,880
bidding on.

Here's the deal, Danni.

345

This has a wax seal on it.

346
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,782
It needs to remain sealed.

347
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:35,616
We'll deal with it when you get

348
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,784

>> This is so random.

367
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,332
I can't believe she's standing

368
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,334

camp with you.

381
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,391

00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,560
living for the last month.

384
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,645
Only two people can share money,

385
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,647
but only one person gets their

386
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,358
loved one, so somebody would be

387
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,401
helping somebody else out.

388
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,570
>> Bidding starts at 40 bucks.

389
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:55,112
>> Forty.

390
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:55,946
>> JEFF: Steph, 40.

391
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,530
>> Eighty.

392
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,531
>> JEFF: Judd at 80.

393
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,491
>> Hundred.

394
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,283
>> JEFF: Lydia with 100.

395
00:10:59,367 --> 00:10:59,909
>> Hundred and thirty.

396
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,118
>> JEFF: 130.

397
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:01,869
>> Hundred and forty.

398
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:02,286
>> JEFF: Cindy, 140.

399
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:02,870
>> Three hundred.

400
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,122
>> JEFF: Rafe goes to 300.

401
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:05,873
It's gonna get down to sharing

402
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:06,749
of money now.

403
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,249
>> How much do you have?

404
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,834
>> I got 200.

405
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:13,381
>> JEFF: Steph asking Lydia for

406
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,757
a favor.

407
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,926
>> Will you give me 200?

408
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:17,760
>> JEFF: Cindy, you're giving

409
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:18,886
him everything you have?

410
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:19,887
>> I was already out.

411
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,097
I already didn't have enough.

412
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:21,806
>> JEFF: Steph takes all of

413
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,265
Lydia's money.

414
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,266
She's counting it up.

415
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,184
Judd has taken all of Cindy's

416
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,519
money.

417
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,187
>> 40, 60, 80...

418
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,021
>> JEFF: Who's getting a visit

419
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,147
with their loved one?

420
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,190
>> 20, 40, 50...

421
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:31,941
There is 750.

422
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,859
>> JEFF: Steph has $750

423
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,237
combining her money with Lydia.

424
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,448
>> 20, 40, 60, 80, 700.

425
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,868
20, 40, 60, 80, 800.

426
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,954
40, 70, 880.

427
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:45,704
>> JEFF: Eight eighty.

428
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,288
Steph has done everything she

429
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:50,209
can.

430
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,544
>> Judd has bought his loved

431
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:52,878
one for 880 bucks.

432
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,005
>> Kristin, go give him some

433
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:58,551
love.

434
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,262
(applause)

435
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,433
>> JEFF: You're going with him,

436
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,184
Kristin, like it or not.

437
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,520
Judd, in addition to having

438
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,147
Kristin spend the night, you

439
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,481
have purchased the right to

440
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,109
invite two other loved ones to

441
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,652
camp with you as well.

442
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:17,278
>> Judd, please...

443
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,279
>> Oh, yes!

444
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,029
>> JEFF: While you and the loved

445
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,990
ones will all go back to your

446
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,992
camp, the three survivors who

447
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,077
you do not pick will go back to

448
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,872
the old Yaxha camp and spend the

449
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,290
night alone.

450
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:29,915
They will not get anything, not

451
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,501
so much as a hug.

452
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,627
So you're going to make two

453
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,837
people really happy and three

454
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:40,801
people really unhappy.

455
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,803
>> I mean, Cindy, of course.

456
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,054
If it wasn't for her, my wife

457
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:44,763
wouldn't be here.

458
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,265
>> JEFF: Mindy, you are going to

459
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,892
get the<i> Survivor</i> experience.

460
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,810
(applause)

461
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,562
>> She's still strong.

462
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,104
>> JEFF: All right, Judd.

463
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,732
Now you got a big choice left.

464
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,776
Rafe, crying at seeing his mom.

465
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,944
Stephanie tried to outbid to you

466
00:12:59,028 --> 00:12:59,820
to see her boyfriend.

467
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,114
Lydia hasn't seen her brother in

468
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:02,990
two years.

469
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:03,949
>> I'm going to take my Jersey

470
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,369
girl with me.

471
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,370
>> JEFF: Michael, give her a

472
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,372
hug.

473
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,834
>> (laughing)

474
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,836
>> (applause)

475
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,378
>> JEFF: Steph, take Michael

476
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,339
back over to the bench.

477
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,507
>> This is Judd.

478
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,382
(laughing)

479
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,258
>> JEFF: Got three very happy

480
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,552
survivors and three survivors

481
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,845
who are going to have a rough

482
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,263
night alone.

483
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,598
Say your good-byes, guys.

484
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,682
>> Take care.

485
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:29,266
Keep up the good work, all

486
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,892
right?

487
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:30,893
>> Bye, Joe.

488
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:31,393
>> Bye.

489
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,394
Be tough.

490
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,062
>> (sobbing)

491
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,855
>> (mumbles)

492
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,609
>> Love you.

493
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,069
>> JEFF: All right, Lydia,

494
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,279
Danni, Rafe, head on out.

495
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:46,575
>> Bye, guys.

496
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,826
>> JEFF: All right, guys.

497
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,995
Take them back to camp.

498
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:08,973
>> Welcome home, folks.

499
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,308
Michael, Kristy and Mindy, this

500
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,059
is what we call home for 31

501
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,937
days, man.

502
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,730
And that's how we get our water,

503
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,315
our wood and everything.

504
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,108
This is why Uncle Chub lost 40

505
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,402
pounds.

506
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:21,986
This is where we live for 31

507
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,195
days.

508
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,281
This is what we call home, man.

509
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,156
This is what we've been living

510
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,992
in, so welcome to beautiful

511
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,785
Guatemala.

512
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:30,786
>> Thank you.

513
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:31,203
>> Nice to meet you.

514
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,830
>> Finally.

515
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:33,539
>> Judd, you learned how to make

516
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:34,331
fire?

517
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,207
>> I'm, like, the Iron Man.

518
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:35,499
>> Get out!

519
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,209
No way!

520
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,210
>> My wife was pretty shocked,

521
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,962
man, at my camping skills.

522
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:40,963
She was digging it.

523
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,549
She thought it was pretty hot.

524
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,009
She thought I was a sexy camper.

525
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,510
This is how we get our water,

526
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,344
'cause you're always dehydrated

527
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,095
here.

528
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,221
This is lake water that we got

529
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,389
to boil.

530
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:54,018
Just drink it right out.

531
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,853
>> Really?

532
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:56,312
Can I have a little?

533
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:56,979
He knows what he's doing.

534
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,731
I never thought he'd know what

535
00:14:58,814 --> 00:14:58,939
to do.

536
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,691
I'm shocked, 'cause he seems

537
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:01,191
like he's doing it all.

538
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,944
I'm very proud of him.

539
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,821
I'm impressed.

540
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:06,488
>> Usually, we take our palm

541
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,740
fronds and we spread them out

542
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:08,741
all over here.

543
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,367
People who sleep by the fire.

544
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,827
And I sleep right here.

545
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,829
>> I'm excited to be here,

546
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:15,581
because this is what I grew up

547
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,206
doing.

548
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,416
Playing wilderness people was

549
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,834
our favorite thing to play.

550
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:19,335
It's, like, our greatest

551
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,378
adventure yet.

552
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,087
>> The first two days was an

553
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:22,421
11.

554
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,339
5-mile hike.

555
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,214
We had to stop and just sleep in

556
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,591
the jungle somewhere.

557
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:26,967
Through thick jungle.

558
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,927
It was horrible.

559
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:29,720
We thought we were going to die.

560
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:30,929
Oh, my God.

561
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,389
To have Mike here-- it's a dream

562
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,099
come true.

563
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,893
I owe Judd big time, 'cause this

564
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,478
is the second time he's given me

565
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,187
a sweet reward and shared a

566
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,189
sweet reward with me.

567
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,358
>> This is all coming down to

568
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,400
the wire here, but we-we've got

569
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,277
got a tight alliance here.

570
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,195
It's me, Steph, Cindy and Rafe

571
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,448
in an alliance right now that's

572
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,991
tight as can be.

573
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,285
Steph, I hope, goes my way.

574
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,120
That takes me to the final two,

575
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,374
if all goes well.

576
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:07,966
>> It's been awhile since we've

577
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:08,342
been here, Rafe.

578
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,885
>> No kidding.

579
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:11,095
>> Wow, this is our...

580
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,012
>> It's been, like, 20 days...

581
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,014
>> Day one camp.

582
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,641
>> We came back to the old Yaxha

583
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:16,809
camp today after the reward

584
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,268
challenge, and it was like a

585
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,853
homecoming of sorts, getting to

586
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,271
the camp and seeing that old

587
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:21,939
lean-to.

588
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:22,523
How long are we going to be

589
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:23,565
here?

590
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,441
But also, like, a fight for

591
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,485
survival.

592
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:29,822
I think we should be really

593
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,115
careful about, you know, what's

594
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,783
happening, and I trust you a

595
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:33,492
lot.

596
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,201
>> It's hard to trust anybody.

597
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,495
That's why Gary told me I could

598
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:37,371
trust you.

599
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,122
He's like, "Just, you know,

600
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,039
stick with Rafe."

601
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:39,665
>> And that's same thing he told

602
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:40,499
me.

603
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,250
Judd's the only one that I feel

604
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,459
is, like, ready to break.

605
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:42,835
>> Yeah, he's...

606
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:43,836
Yeah.

607
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,128
>> You know?

608
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,004
>> He's a threat.

609
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:46,547
He's definitely a threat.

610
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,881
The only person I really feel

611
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,091
like I can trust now is Rafe.

612
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,050
I think he knows that I'm

613
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,386
important to have around for

614
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,220
him because that alliance is

615
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,139
going to start wanting to vote

616
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,473
somebody out, and they have to

617
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,266
see Rafe as threat.

618
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,268
Um, so he needs another buddy.

619
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,811
I'm sure Judd or Cindy is going

620
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:01,979
to approach me, 'cause they're

621
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,981
going to have to number-wise.

622
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:04,982
>> Right.

623
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:05,607
>> If he talks to me or talks to

624
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,776
Lydia, tries to vote against

625
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,404
you, we'll just let you know.

626
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,071
>> Well, he's in control kind

627
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,449
of, but also in a really tenuous

628
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,158
position because you and me are

629
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:18,662
way closer than him and me.

630
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,081
And, like, we just need to catch

631
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,124
Judd in some kind of lie.

632
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,292
>> Mm-hmm.

633
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,502
>> So that we can show Steph

634
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:25,836
that that's...

635
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,045
'Cause right now, she really,

636
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:27,463
really trusts him.

637
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,173
I know that Judd is threatened

638
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:29,381
by me.

639
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,883
I know that Judd might want to

640
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:31,467
get me out before he says he

641
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,719
does, so I have to make back-up

642
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,179
plans so that if he tries, then

643
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:37,681
I'll be safe.

644
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:38,432
You can't trust a person like

645
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,266
Judd, but you can trust that you

646
00:17:39,349 --> 00:18:19,056
can't trust him.

647
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,516
>> So, so, Cindy, we-we should

648
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,600
be all right for...

649
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:22,643
still with

650
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:23,560
our final four.

651
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,603
The reason I'm saying that is

652
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,312
because Danni does have that

653
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,064
clue.

654
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,649
Okay, good, take that clue,

655
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:29,691
fine, you know what I mean?

656
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,567
Go ahead.

657
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,360
>> She's not usually a front-

658
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:31,944
runner.

659
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:32,653
>> No, she's not a threat at

660
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:33,654
all, so that's good for us.

661
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:34,905
>> Mentally or physically, she's

662
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:35,489
not usually a front-runner.

663
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,241
One thing she's good at is

664
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,367
shooting basketballs.

665
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,743
>> That's it, so we have an edge

666
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:40,160
on her.

667
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:40,744
>> She must have something if

668
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:41,870
she made it this far.

669
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,496
>> If she wins, that's-that's

670
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,081
okay.

671
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,332
I mean, it's not the end of our

672
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,500
world right here.

673
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,210
If she wins it, that's fine.

674
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,421
Then we get rid of Lydia.

675
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,422
God, I'm so glad this worked out

676
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,175
this way.

677
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,528
>> They told me the mother lode.

678
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,655
I just get my whole bunch, then

679
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,241
I'm good for the night.

680
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,075
That's all we do.

681
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:21,451
We make two wood runs a day.

682
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:21,743
That's it.

683
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,327
(mosquitoes buzzing)

684
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,706
>> (grunting)

685
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:26,582
>> It's a lot more barren than I

686
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,333
had expected, that's for sure.

687
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,293
They have nothing, and it's so

688
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,210
much work.

689
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,672
Everything they do is just such

690
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,592
a chore, really.

691
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,342
>> This is a real deal, and most

692
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,385
people would not survive out

693
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:41,221
here in a, you know, a day.

694
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:45,601
It's crazy.

695
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,644
>> Hmm.

696
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,232
>> We're back.

697
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,734
>> Hey.

698
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:54,568
>> Hi, guys.

699
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:55,444
>> Hey!

700
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,571
>> Hey, you!

701
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:58,530
Still there.

702
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,115
>> Hi.

703
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:02,117
>> We just started making corn.

704
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,160
>> What do you say there, Mr.

705
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,077
Rafe-inator?

706
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,495
>> We just came back and walked

707
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,496
in, and we didn't think that the

708
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,623
family members would still be

709
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,082
here, but they are.

710
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,959
Um, and so it's been kind of

711
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:11,168
nice.

712
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,377
We got to meet them all, talk to

713
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,129
them, see that they're not

714
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:16,715
loving camp life at all.

715
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:17,674
>> So, what'd you think about

716
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:18,634
this experience?

717
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,761
>> I've never camped ever before

718
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,304
in my life.

719
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,307
I don't know how you do it.

720
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,308
>> It felt great having my wife

721
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:26,642
here at camp.

722
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,434
I haven't been eating, so I feel

723
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,645
like she actually made me full

724
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,354
just by looking at her.

725
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:34,149
It's like eating 25 White Castle

726
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:36,485
cheeseburgers, man.

727
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,403
(all saying good-byes)

728
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,279
>> I'll see you soon.

729
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:39,696
>> Nice meeting you.

730
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,822
Good luck.

731
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:41,531
Bye.

732
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,409
>> Nice meeting you.

733
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,460
>> We all walked down here to

734
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,170
the boat dock and had to say

735
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:56,296
good-bye to our loved ones.

736
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,131
And it was hard, but I'm glad

737
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,633
she was here to see it.

738
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,802
She wished me lots of luck and

739
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,387
she knows I can do it, man.

740
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,638
I'm going to do it.

741
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:05,472
>> You've made it through the

742
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:05,722
hard part.

743
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:06,890
>> I know.

744
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,892
>> I love you so much.

745
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:09,434
I've missed Judd so much.

746
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,186
The longest I've never spoke to

747
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:12,980
him was, like, 24 hours.

748
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:13,397
And, um...

749
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,941
I just can't wait for

750
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,567
him to come home.

751
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:22,781
>> I just thought it was really

752
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:23,448
incredible that my sister got to

753
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,325
be here.

754
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,576
It's just going to make it even

755
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,494
more of a memorable experience

756
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,663
forever.

757
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,456
>> Bye.

758
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,332
>> Bye, you guys.

759
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,544
>> Bye, you guys!

760
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:42,968
>> It was bittersweet, but it

761
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:43,760
was more sweet than anything

762
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,345
else.

763
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:45,721
I hate good-byes.

764
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:51,101
So I can't wait to say hello.

765
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,423
>> Oh, thank you.

766
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:52,954
>> Judd was talking about how

767
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,498
it's important to get rid of the

768
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,666
strongest, um, you know,

769
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,043
survivors that are left.

770
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:58,543
And Rafe has the, uh...

771
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,378
talked

772
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,254
to me the day before and said,

773
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,923
you know, "If Judd says anything

774
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:03,632
about voting me off, I think we

775
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:04,633
can get Stephenie's vote against

776
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,425
Judd."

777
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,010
And I know Lydia and I are

778
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:07,594
desperate.

779
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,596
We'll, you know, stick with him.

780
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,889
>> Judd, you know what?

781
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:13,391
Maybe it's time we make a deal.

782
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,142
>> You know what?

783
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,018
I don't have a problem with

784
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:15,602
that.

785
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:16,520
>> It's funny.

786
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,145
The longer you stick around, the

787
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,730
more problems you can cause.

788
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,107
You know, more doors will open,

789
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:20,732
so it seems like I have a little

790
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,609
bit of a crack.

791
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,653
(laughs)

792
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:41,545
>> JEFF: Come on in, guys.

793
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,671
First things first.

794
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:46,424
Rafe, give up immunity.

795
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,178
You've had this for awhile.

796
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,930
Once again, immunity is back up

797
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:52,681
for grabs.

798
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,599
All right, let's get to today's

799
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,892
challenge.

800
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:56,518
It is for immunity.

801
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,688
It requires smarts.

802
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,897
It's a bit of a human chess

803
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:01,106
game.

804
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,732
Here is how it works.

805
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,567
One at a time, you're each going

806
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,152
to make a move on our multi-

807
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,736
level board by flipping a tile

808
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,780
to its red side and stepping on

809
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:09,990
it.

810
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,783
You can move forward.

811
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,077
You can move backward.

812
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,370
You can move side to side.

813
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:17,706
You cannot move diagonally.

814
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,249
Once you stepped off the red

815
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,959
tile, no one can step onto it

816
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:21,668
again.

817
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,628
In addition, the top platform is

818
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,089
a spinning platform, so if at

819
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:26,673
any time, you want to

820
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,342
strategically relocate yourself

821
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,052
to somewhere else on the board,

822
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,679
spin yourself to a new spot.

823
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,181
As you all move around the

824
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,182
board, there will be fewer and

825
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:38,310
fewer white tiles to flip over.

826
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,519
At some point, you'll run out of

827
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,354
tiles to step onto.

828
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,397
When that happens, you're out of

829
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,648
the game.

830
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,734
Last person left standing wins

831
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,694
immunity, guarantees themselves

832
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:50,739
a spot in the final five.

833
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,033
Danni, at the auction, you

834
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,743
purchased an advantage...

835
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,327
>> Yep.

836
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:55,619
>> JEFF: ...

837
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:56,328
to today's immunity

838
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,162
challenge.

839
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,330
You still have the envelope?

840
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:58,747
>> Yes.

841
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,706
>> JEFF: Okay, let me see it.

842
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:00,624
Still sealed.

843
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:01,374
>> Oh, yeah.

844
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,167
>> JEFF: Good, don't open it

845
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:02,667
yet.

846
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,418
>> I'm a good girl.

847
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:04,044
>> JEFF: Take a spot on the

848
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:07,047
board, and we'll get started.

849
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:07,881
All right, we've drawn for spots

850
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,090
on the board.

851
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,717
Danni, time to open your

852
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,553
immunity advantage.

853
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,680
>> See what it is.

854
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,557
>> JEFF: Read it out loud.

855
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,476
>> Switch positions with

856
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,268
any player.

857
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,270
>> JEFF: So, what that means is,

858
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,272
at any time in this game you can

859
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,984
trade spots with any player one

860
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:28,193
time.

861
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,278
If you understand how to play

862
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:30,820
this game, that is a huge

863
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,239
advantage.

864
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,615
If you don't, it might just

865
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,116
extend your life a little

866
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,325
longer.

867
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,202
>> Let's find out.

868
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:38,662
Everybody make your first

869
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:42,749
move.

870
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,089
Everybody's on the board.

871
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:52,008
Danni, you're up.

872
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:56,137
Cindy.

873
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,306
Danni goes sideways.

874
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,975
Cindy goes forward.

875
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:04,521
Judd.

876
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:08,817
Rafe.

877
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,321
Steph.

878
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:19,035
Lydia.

879
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,247
Danni.

880
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,333
Cindy.

881
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,710
Cindy continues to move

882
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:27,377
forward.

883
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,587
Judd.

884
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:30,797
Rafe.

885
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,633
Stephenie.

886
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:36,344
Anxious to go.

887
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,762
Lydia.

888
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,515
Everybody with a slightly

889
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:44,436
different game plan.

890
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,854
Cindy, going up to the

891
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,230
spinning platform.

892
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,190
Going to spin herself into a

893
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,068
new spot.

894
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,241
Lydia, which tile is she

895
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,285
going to move?

896
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,703
Cindy, surrounded by a sea of

897
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:02,871
red.

898
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,956
No more tiles to flip over.

899
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,374
Cindy can't move.

900
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,000
She's first one out of the game.

901
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,835
Take a spot on the bench.

902
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:13,715
Steph is up.

903
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,009
Steph's carved out a nice

904
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:19,304
piece of real estate.

905
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,181
Danni, your move.

906
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:24,309
>> Can I switch?

907
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,977
>> JEFF: You can switch any time

908
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:26,603
you want.

909
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,938
Immunity and a spot in the final

910
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:29,773
five is riding on this

911
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,524
challenge.

912
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,109
>> I want to switch with Steph.

913
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,736
>> JEFF: Danni uses her immunity

914
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:35,445
advantage.

915
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,072
Steph doesn't like it.

916
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:37,739
Danni, Steph, switch

917
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:41,117
positions.

918
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,244
Only time will tell if it was

919
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,455
the right move.

920
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:46,289
Lydia.

921
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,292
Takes her last move.

922
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:49,834
>> Last move.

923
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,503
>> JEFF: Step on it then take a

924
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,004
spot on the bench next to Cindy.

925
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,714
Lydia, second person out of

926
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,591
the game.

927
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,134
We're down to four.

928
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:58,927
Danni, Judd, Rafe on one side

929
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,595
of the board.

930
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:02,472
Steph alone on the other.

931
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:07,185
Judd, your move.

932
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,562
Rafe's turn.

933
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,731
Starting to get interesting.

934
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:16,945
Danni.

935
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:22,409
Steph.

936
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,954
Judd.

937
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:29,707
Rafe.

938
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,126
Rafe and Danni closing in on

939
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:31,918
the same tiles.

940
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:36,464
Danni.

941
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,174
Danni makes her move, and in

942
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,801
doing so, ends the game for

943
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:40,844
Rafe, who has nowhere left to

944
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,011
move.

945
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:42,762
>> Good job, Rafe.

946
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:45,265
>> JEFF: Rafe joins Lydia and

947
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,391
Cindy on the bench.

948
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,309
We are down to three.

949
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,937
Steph.

950
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,982
Judd.

951
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:57,777
Judd makes his last move.

952
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:58,862
>> I've got one more.

953
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,530
>> JEFF: Judd, you cannot move

954
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:00,989
diagonally.

955
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,657
Nowhere left to go.

956
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,743
You're out of the game.

957
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,037
We're down to two.

958
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,497
Danni and Steph.

959
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,458
Danni made Steph switch

960
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,042
positions with her.

961
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,044
Steph, only so many tiles

962
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,629
left to work with.

963
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:22,677
Just play it out now.

964
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,138
Danni.

965
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,191
With that, Steph has only one

966
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,942
move left to make.

967
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,986
Steph is out.

968
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,822
Danni wins immunity.

969
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:43,865
Well played.

970
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:44,824
Well spent.

971
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,367
>> Well spent.

972
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,619
>> JEFF: Money well spent.

973
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,537
Danni, come on up.

974
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,371
(applause)

975
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,123
A lot of things bid on at

976
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,082
that auction.

977
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,376
Nothing more valuable than

978
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,794
this right now.

979
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,379
>> I love this thing.

980
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,297
>> JEFF: Well played.

981
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,298
You are safe tonight at

982
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:00,924
Tribal Council.

983
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,050
Steph, Judd, Cindy, Lydia,

984
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:05,136
Rafe, after 33 days, one of you

985
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:05,929
is going home tonight.

986
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:08,097
See you at Tribal Council.

987
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:11,184
Head on back to camp.

988
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:28,743
>> Good job.

989
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:30,161
>> Good job, Danni.

990
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:30,703
>> Thank you.

991
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:32,830
>> I don't know about you...

992
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,124
>> I thought I'd be going next

993
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:35,416
for sure.

994
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,085
That was like the biggest

995
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,004
immunity I could ever win.

996
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,215
There's lot of things going on

997
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:42,882
right now.

998
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,759
So something may work out even

999
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:47,804
more so in my favor tonight.

1000
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:58,565
>> Where did Judd go?

1001
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,030
>> I'd like to believe Judd.

1002
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,031
I believe Judd for the most part

1003
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,408
but already made clear that he's

1004
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:51,576
playing this game and do

1005
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,285
anything to win.

1006
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,620
He's already been caught in

1007
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,996
quite a few lies.

1008
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,623
And Danni really hasn't lied at

1009
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:59,417
all.

1010
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,547
>> Whoa.

1011
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,719
>> Said a million times he's

1012
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,221
like, "I'm here to win.

1013
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,263
I'll do whatever it takes."

1014
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,348
>> We have to be...

1015
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,974
>> We've been trying to be

1016
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:57,225
honest.

1017
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,476
>> For the most part.

1018
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,852
>> Like I don't know...

1019
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,354
>> We were saying if he goes

1020
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,064
tonight we'll want Lydia to go

1021
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,023
next then we'll go to the four.

1022
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,358
>> Yeah.

1023
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:06,109
>> With Cindy.

1024
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:06,693
>> Yeah.

1025
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,986
>> I mean, what do you think?

1026
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:09,737
What if Cindy...

1027
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,197
if we vote for

1028
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,324
Judd, they all vote for us.

1029
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,158
>> I think Lydia will vote for

1030
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,243
us.

1031
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,078
>> She said she would vote for

1032
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:17,495
Judd.

1033
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:18,871
>> I think she would.

1034
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:19,414
>> You do?

1035
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,040
And what, do we tell Cindy?

1036
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,458
>> What do you think?

1037
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,251
>> My heart tells me get rid of

1038
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,670
Lydia because Judd and I have

1039
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:26,170
been really close.

1040
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,130
>> At the same time, if someone

1041
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,632
is going to slit your throat

1042
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,342
because they like your company,

1043
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,927
hell, no, they got to go.

1044
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,054
>> I love Judd, though.

1045
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:35,722
I do.

1046
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,557
I told his wife that we were

1047
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,808
sticking together.

1048
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:39,934
I feel horrible.

1049
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:41,853
But if he's likely to turn, I

1050
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:42,270
can't...

1051
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,271
You know, I never...

1052
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,897
>> I basically told Stephenie

1053
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:45,356
what was going on now.

1054
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,150
And now she's kinda thinking

1055
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,235
maybe we might vote Judd out

1056
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,737
tonight.

1057
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,030
So hopefully my plan worked to

1058
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:56,242
rat Judd out.

1059
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,827
>> Absolutely.

1060
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,121
>> It's weird how the original

1061
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,749
plan was to take Danni out.

1062
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,709
She won immunity on the day that

1063
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,669
she needed it, you know what I'm

1064
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,755
saying?

1065
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,631
I'm here if you want to use my

1066
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,048
vote.

1067
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,884
If not.

1068
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,761
Auf Wiedersehen.

1069
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,053
Arrivederci.

1070
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,013
Sayonara.

1071
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,139
Good-bye.

1072
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:22,769
>> Nobody is safe here tonight.

1073
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,145
If you think you're safe in this

1074
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:24,562
game, you're crazy.

1075
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:25,646
>> Yeah.

1076
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,650
>> You're absolutely berserk.

1077
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,157
>> If anybody needs me for their

1078
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,744
vote, I'm here for them.

1079
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,037
You know what I'm sayin'?

1080
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,163
I'm not about to give up.

1081
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,916
I'm not about to quit.

1082
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,893
>> We have alliance to me,

1083
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,937
Cindy, Stephenie and Rafe.

1084
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,189
And we had agreed if Danni won

1085
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,901
immunity it's going to be Lydia.

1086
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:13,945
>> Do you know if she's lied?

1087
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,404
>> She's working, man.

1088
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,281
I said it could be me, it could

1089
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,825
be you.

1090
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:19,742
>> It could be Rafe.

1091
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:20,785
>> That's what I said.

1092
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:23,329
I said it could be anybody here.

1093
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:25,623
>> That's funny.

1094
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,166
>> No, it's not.

1095
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,918
But you got to say something.

1096
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,211
I mean, you can't just sit

1097
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,963
there.

1098
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,256
You know what I mean?

1099
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:33,548
Jellybean?

1100
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:34,382
>> I know what you mean,

1101
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,844
jellybean.

1102
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:43,391
>> Yeah, I'll miss Lydia around

1103
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,600
camp.

1104
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,018
I'll miss her singing and

1105
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,395
dancing, all that.

1106
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:50,022
But one other person goes I move

1107
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:50,189
up.

1108
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,566
No hard feelings.

1109
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,276
So, you know, pretty glad

1110
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,653
somebody's going home right now.

1111
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:56,904
As long as it ain't me, man,

1112
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:57,488
I'll always have a smile on my

1113
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,950
face.

1114
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,469
>> JEFF: We now bring in the

1115
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,555
members of our jury.

1116
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:25,850
Bobby Jon, Jamie, and Gary voted

1117
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:28,895
out last Tribal Council.

1118
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:32,356
So let's talk about the loved

1119
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,608
ones.

1120
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,276
Steph, you and Michael have been

1121
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,569
going out seven years?

1122
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:36,986
>> Yes.

1123
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:37,528
>> JEFF: It had to be just

1124
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,947
wonderful to have him out there

1125
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,324
and experience that with you.

1126
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,492
>> Yeah, it was really special

1127
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,661
and really awesome because now

1128
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:46,370
he can really understand what

1129
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,873
we've all been going through,

1130
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,249
and it was just like, "This

1131
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:50,750
sucks."

1132
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,585
He's like, "You guys are tough."

1133
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:53,419
>> JEFF: Let's talk about the

1134
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,338
immunity challenge.

1135
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,965
Danni, you are smiling from ear

1136
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:58,466
to ear right now.

1137
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,593
>> Oh, my, gosh.

1138
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,261
When it came up in the auction

1139
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,346
to get the advantage, there was

1140
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:06,015
no way I was going to let that

1141
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:06,223
pass.

1142
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,100
And fortunately it worked out.

1143
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:08,643
And like I started to cry.

1144
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,645
I've cried twice over spaghetti

1145
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:11,437
and over immunity.

1146
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,689
So I was very, very happy and

1147
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:14,398
needed it.

1148
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,150
>> JEFF: Cindy, take me through

1149
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:17,652
that process emotionally of how

1150
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,236
it becomes more difficult to

1151
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:19,862
vote tonight.

1152
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,405
>> You have to consider the

1153
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,366
person you're voting out and how

1154
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,076
their alliance is going to

1155
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,494
affect your alliance with

1156
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,495
whoever is left.

1157
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,955
Also the person that's going

1158
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,289
home is going to have some say

1159
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,874
if you end up in the final two

1160
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:32,458
and whether or not you win.

1161
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:33,376
So you got 20 things going

1162
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,461
through your head that you have

1163
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:36,504
to consider.

1164
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,965
>> JEFF: Rafe, have you started

1165
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,508
to consider how it's going to be

1166
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,300
different after tonight's Tribal

1167
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,844
Council when you are now down to

1168
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:44,720
odd number, five.

1169
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:45,429
>> It's like, you don't know

1170
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,015
exactly who to trust, but you

1171
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,517
have to like kind of believe

1172
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,185
that you have the right gut

1173
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:52,895
feeling about who you can trust

1174
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:53,521
around here.

1175
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,064
Because that's the only thing

1176
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,399
that's going to get to you the

1177
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,025
end of the game at this point.

1178
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,318
With this few people left you

1179
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,028
have to have strong trust to get

1180
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,238
to the end of the game.

1181
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,240
>> JEFF: Steph, how important is

1182
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,075
it to you how you vote somebody

1183
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,118
out of this game?

1184
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,661
>> For me it's important to vote

1185
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,079
somebody out and know that

1186
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,539
you're making the right choice

1187
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,207
and be able to, if you make it

1188
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,542
to the final two, to explain

1189
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,126
yourself.

1190
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,336
Explain your reasoning behind

1191
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:17,670
it.

1192
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:18,379
And it's hard.

1193
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,214
Because you let your emotions

1194
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:20,756
get to you.

1195
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,258
We are all fighting for a

1196
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,467
million bucks, but we're

1197
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:23,759
like family.

1198
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,094
We really are.

1199
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,971
>> JEFF: Judd, somebody in this

1200
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,764
family will be going tonight.

1201
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,391
>> Well, I tell what you, to be

1202
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,309
honest with you, no matter what

1203
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,811
they all say, everybody wants

1204
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:34,937
somebody to go home.

1205
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,397
I mean, they're sitting here

1206
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,149
making believe like, oh, man,

1207
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:38,983
going to stink.

1208
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:39,525
That's not the case, man.

1209
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,819
Everybody wants somebody to go

1210
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:42,194
home.

1211
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:42,987
That's the bottom line.

1212
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:43,988
That's what we're here for.

1213
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,865
Only way you move on is somebody

1214
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:46,365
goes home.

1215
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,908
No hard feelings, but deal with

1216
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:48,242
it.

1217
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,785
That's basically the way I look

1218
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:50,202
at it.

1219
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,537
If somebody goes home, that's

1220
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:51,871
better for me.

1221
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,914
You just got to trust and love

1222
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:59,670
the ones you're with right now.

1223
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,172
>> JEFF: Danni, you paid a lot

1224
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,506
of money to get that immunity

1225
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:02,923
around your neck.

1226
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,800
I can't imagine you're giving it

1227
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:05,134
up.

1228
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,635
>> No, I think I'm going to keep

1229
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:06,969
it.

1230
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,471
>> JEFF: Danni is the only one

1231
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,555
you cannot vote for.

1232
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,182
Everybody else is fair game.

1233
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:11,807
Time to vote.

1234
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,852
Rafe, you're up.

1235
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:21,567
>> You're always saying we're a

1236
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,402
bunch of squirrels trying to get

1237
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,612
a nut.

1238
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,405
Well, sorry, I had to write your

1239
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,365
name down, but I had to do what

1240
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,035
I had to do today.

1241
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,543
>> Hey, Lydia, you sang and you

1242
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:40,419
danced your way right out of

1243
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,629
the jungle.

1244
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:45,174
Adios.

1245
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,476
>> JEFF: I'll tally the votes.

1246
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,195
Once the votes are read, the

1247
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,029
decision is final.

1248
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:07,613
The person voted out will be

1249
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,490
asked to leave the Tribal

1250
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,741
Council area immediately.

1251
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,451
I'll read the votes.

1252
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:19,041
First vote: Judd.

1253
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:19,834
Lydia.

1254
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:23,504
One vote Lydia.

1255
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,132
Lydia.

1256
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:29,510
Two votes Lydia, one vote Judd.

1257
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,719
Judd.

1258
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:36,809
Two votes Judd, two votes Lydia.

1259
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:37,351
Judd.

1260
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:38,644
That's three votes Judd,

1261
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:41,021
two votes Lydia.

1262
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,648
One vote left.

1263
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,407
13th person voted out of

1264
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,575
Survivor: Guatemala: Judd.

1265
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:53,576
>> Thanks, guys.

1266
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,494
Hope you guys all get bit by a

1267
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:58,873
freakin' crocodile.

1268
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:02,209
Scumbags.

1269
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:07,631
>> JEFF: Judd, the Tribe has

1270
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:11,385
spoken.

1271
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:15,806
Time to go.

1272
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,732
>> JEFF: After tonight's vote

1273
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,817
one thing should be very clear:

1274
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,695
you can no longer rely on what

1275
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,614
used to be because this game

1276
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:34,742
just took a change in a very big

1277
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:35,993
way.

1278
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:36,952
Grab your torches.

1279
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:37,828
Go back to camp.

1280
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,496
Good night.

1281
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:51,675
>> ANNOUNCER: Stay tuned for

1282
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,303
scenes from our next episode.

1283
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,350
>> JEFF: Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>

1284
00:41:59,433 --> 00:41:59,975
>> I see a little pattern there,

1285
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,894
and it makes me uncomfortable.

1286
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,395
>> JEFF: Cindy is consoled after

1287
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:03,979
Tribal Council.

1288
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,856
>> He's not privileged of the

1289
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,607
information.

1290
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,274
>> Really?

1291
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,859
>> JEFF: The strategy deepens.

1292
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,653
>> That's tough decision.

1293
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,571
>> JEFF: And the tribe is

1294
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,114
shocked with an awful dilemma.

1295
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:17,076
>> Oh, my God.

1296
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,790
>> I'm really pissed off.

1297
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,667
I mean, I feel I was pissed on,

1298
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,709
pissed off, lied to, betrayed.

1299
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:26,710
It doesn't feel good being

1300
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,671
blind-sided and it sucks being

1301
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:29,922
lied to, man, because one thing

1302
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,048
I didn't do was lie to anybody,

1303
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:31,382
man.

1304
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,424
Hey, get rid of the biggest

1305
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,509
target, and that's what they

1306
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:33,801
did, man.

1307
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:34,885
So, I really believe that you

1308
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,095
are a bunch of scumbags, and I

1309
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,137
can't wait till the final two,

1310
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,222
man. I'll have a lot more to
