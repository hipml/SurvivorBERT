00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:04,212
(Jeff Probst)
Previously on<i> Survivor:</i>

2
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:05,296
- Down, down, down!

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,298
- (Probst) 16 strangers were
abandoned in the heart

4
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:09,092
of wild Africa.

5
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:10,510
- Have a nice day.

6
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:11,928
- We could take
one full and if

7
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:12,929
it's too heavy we can
dump it on the way.

8
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:14,597
- Oh...

9
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,100
- (Probst) Desperation set in
when both tribes discovered

10
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,018
their water sources
weren't what they expected.

11
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:19,602
- It's sick.

12
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,186
The water is disgusting.

13
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,229
I'm terrified.

14
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,314
- We'll have to boil it.

15
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:27,569
You end up with dysentery which
basically has you puking and

16
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:28,611
crapping your guts out.

17
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:29,612
- Go, baby!

18
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,281
- (Probst) The first challenge
took its toll,

19
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,409
especially on Diane
from Boran.

20
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,453
Samburu claimed
victory and immunity.

21
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,956
Back at the Boran camp, Clarence
was in hot water for sharing a

22
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:42,792
can of beans with Diane
while the others were away.

23
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:43,877
- Tommy, Tommy...

24
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,170
I had to open it
for her.

25
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:46,629
- You ain't no doctor.

26
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,714
- (Probst) At the first
Tribal Council,

27
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:50,967
Clarence paid for his
actions by receiving votes,

28
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,845
but Diane was the first one
voted out of the tribe.

29
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,597
15 are left.

30
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,974
Who will be voted out
tonight?

31
00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:00,602
♪♪

32
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:23,601
- Going to Tribal Council

33
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:28,231
is like going to hell for 45
minutes.

34
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,108
It's hot, it's uncomfortable,

35
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:33,111
and nothing good is going to
happen while you're there.

36
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,364
- Did you put your torch there?

37
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,741
- Yeah, I'm going to
go put it away.

38
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,243
- Well, it was tough.

39
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,371
It was tough on all of us.

40
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,417
- Having your name read by
Jeff is horrible.

41
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,127
There was
a sinking feeling,

42
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,255
like I can't believe this is
happening.

43
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,091
- Despite the fact that all of
us had agreed that we are all

44
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,384
going to vote unanimously for
Diane, we thought it was a

45
00:02:56,467 --> 00:03:00,471
really good opportunity for one
of us to vote for Clarence just

46
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:04,434
to teach him a lesson and just
so he knows that he's on shaky

47
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:08,271
ground and that he needs to
shape up.

48
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,943
- I'm just trying to explain to
you that I wouldn't stop to

49
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,945
Diane, and she turned
around and bit me.

50
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,614
All she did was
tell me, you know,

51
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,615
"You're my only friend
here."

52
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,782
- So what do you think?

53
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:20,950
Did she try to screw you?

54
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:21,951
- I think she knew.

55
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,286
She knew that she made
bad waves,

56
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,413
and she looking for
somebody to scapegoat,

57
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,581
and she almost had me.

58
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,000
- Well, I don't know,
Clarence.

59
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,127
It was not
a very good time.

60
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,505
You shouldn't have done that
in the first place.

61
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:38,051
- You know, that's my own fault,
for being too nice.

62
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:38,468
- He's very nervous.

63
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,095
He was shaking.

64
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:45,642
He came up to me, and, like, was
looking for my approval on how I

65
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,312
felt about him and what he had
done, and it felt like he needed

66
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,023
me to tell him that he was
going to be okay.

67
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,441
- But I'm saying,
I didn't do (...) wrong.

68
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,610
- You opened
a can of beans.

69
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,320
- Yeah, yeah, you're right,
you're right.

70
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,655
- You didn't do nothing wrong?

71
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,156
- You're right,
you're right.

72
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,324
- Come on,
you made a bad call.

73
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,659
- All right, that's fair.

74
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,493
- You're going to have
a fair chance.

75
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,495
You don't have to
worry about that.

76
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,829
- I'm not worried
about the game.

77
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,997
- You are worried about
the game.

78
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,123
You are worried
about the game.

79
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,583
Don't sit here and tell me

80
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,834
you're not worried
about the game.

81
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,002
- All right, I'm worried about
the game, but...

82
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,046
- You are worried
about the game.

83
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,466
- We were presented with an
unfortunate situation, but we

84
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,552
turned around, and it ended up
working really in our favor,

85
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,389
because now everybody knows
exactly what Clarence is about.

86
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,391
He can't hide anymore.

87
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:44,409
- Man, everything aches.

88
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,244
- Everything aches.

89
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:49,163
- Sleeping on the ground is
getting really tough.

90
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,874
It's a lot colder than I thought
it was going to be at night.

91
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:52,542
I've shivered both
nights straight through

92
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,128
the whole entire night.

93
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,589
- I'll never complain again
about a lumpy bed in a motel.

94
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:02,343
- The comfort level sleeping is
definitely something that we

95
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,053
could use a
little bit more of.

96
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,848
I don't think one person has
gotten a good night's sleep

97
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,433
since we've been here,
so that's tough.

98
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:17,191
- It's amazing how hot it is
during the day.

99
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,277
So we worked on a shelter
because we knew we really needed

100
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,862
to get under the shade.

101
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,740
We don't really have any shade
in there, and the sun is so hot,

102
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,241
so we started to build a roof
across the top.

103
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:26,993
-- Yeah?y.

104
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,453
We're going to tear the door
apart and save all the materials

105
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,747
over to the side
outside the hut.

106
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,206
- Okay.

107
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,708
Yes, Captain.

108
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,585
- Frank is a really
interesting character, but

109
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:39,881
really for the military, you
know, he barks orders and he

110
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:43,092
just wants things to be done,
kind of right now, his way.

111
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,720
- We'll go right here in to
this corner, and we'll tie into

112
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,889
that corner and over to
that large one there.

113
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,724
- Water, excuse me.

114
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,267
I can't speak.

115
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,602
- I've been working
my buns off.

116
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:56,272
Frank's been working his
buns off, and we're always

117
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,774
thinking the next step ahead

118
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,484
because other people
don't do that.

119
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,444
- This is where you're going to
come in to the shade.

120
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,945
He's going to be
pushing that in.

121
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,448
- What do you think,
Lindsay, Kim... input?

122
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,617
- I say you all give me a job
and I'll get up on it.

123
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,330
- The youth were out here
like on a vacation.

124
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,624
They just straggle here or
there, you know, whether it's

125
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:19,128
their way of making us do all
the work, Carl and myself,

126
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,131
we have to just jump in
there and do something.

127
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,592
You know, Linda and Teresa--
usually don't have to ask them.

128
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:28,262
They're up,
"What can we do?"

129
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,265
- We're almost like two
completely different teams.

130
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,518
For some reason our camp
is split

131
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,603
right down
the middle by age.

132
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:38,147
- That's good,
that works.

133
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,274
- This is nice.

134
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,485
- I would like to see these
differences overcome, but if it

135
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,279
happens the way I have this gut
feeling it's going to happen and

136
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,949
someone's got to be voted
out, I have no problem with it.

137
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,659
There's one or two individuals I
could get rid of right now that

138
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,120
are probably more in the way
than are any good.

139
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,627
- Oh, this is
the mail route.

140
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,129
This is the first time
I've been here.

141
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,088
- This is it.

142
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,844
There's a necklace
in here with a message.

143
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:12,515
"Go straight to the top
for prizes sublime.

144
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,560
"The way to succeed
is one step at a time.

145
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,813
"You can't do it alone,
you must work as one,

146
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:22,108
or disappointment awaits when
the challenge is done."

147
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,694
- What else is in here?
That's it?

148
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,530
- "You can't do it alone.

149
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,031
"You must work as one,

150
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,700
or disappointment awaits when
the challenge is done."

151
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,743
- Maybe it's rock climbing.

152
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:33,870
- Ooh, tha- Ooh.d be cool.

153
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,664
- We should probably think
about what we want because

154
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,250
looks like one of those things
where they might give us

155
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,335
a choice of what we
want more than anything else.

156
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,712
- I still say blankets, I
think, on the basic needs level.

157
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,547
- Bedding?

158
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,590
- Bedding,
yeah, it has been

159
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,550
hard to get comfortable
sleeping.

160
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,594
- Well, I've felt better,
but I guess I've felt worse.

161
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:53,222
We'll open this can of whoop-ass
and see what happens.

162
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,390
- There you go.

163
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:55,683
- There we go.

164
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,609
- (Probst) Hey, guys.

165
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,403
Today's challenge
is for reward.

166
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:08,571
Here's how it works.

167
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,239
Each tribe
has five logs.

168
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:14,243
Your goal: Get your five logs to
your tower, building a

169
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,288
staircase, and get
somebody to the top.

170
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,124
Along the way are a series of
obstacles on your path.

171
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,711
The first tribe to get all five
logs to the tower and get one

172
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,713
member to
the top wins a reward.

173
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,465
The reward is
a few things...

174
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,593
We got blankets, food--

175
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,719
everything else is stuff

176
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:32,762
you guys left behind
back on day one.

177
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,932
You've got to stay
together as a tribe.

178
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,100
You've got to stay on
your own path.

179
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,894
Samburu, because you guys have
one extra member,

180
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:40,937
somebody has
to sit this one out.

181
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,440
And remember, you can't sit
the same person out

182
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,650
in back-to-back
challenges.

183
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,777
Wait for my start.

184
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,821
- This is upper body
strength.

185
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,573
- It's me, it's me.

186
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,074
- (Probst) Okay, here we go.

187
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,617
Survivors, ready!

188
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,660
Go!

189
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,955
- Go, go, go.

190
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,665
- Woo!

191
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,459
- Here we go,
up over this.

192
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:03,960
- Foot up, foot up.

193
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:04,752
Watch stage right.

194
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,463
Slide,
put the log on.

195
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:08,339
Pus- Slide.r.

196
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,465
- Push, push.

197
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:10,174
- Here we go.

198
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,968
- Lay it down,
lay it down.

199
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,094
- Push it.

200
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,136
Push it, lift.

201
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,179
Lift, lift, lift.

202
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:15,972
Step, step.

203
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,348
- Stop.

204
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,975
Step up, step up.

205
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,144
- Go straight,
go straight.

206
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,439
- Get on the other side,
somebody.

207
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,316
- If you're weak,
you can jog behind.

208
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,779
- Woo!

209
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,114
- Steps, guys.

210
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,700
- Here we go:
watch your step.

211
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,118
- Feet up, feet up.

212
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,202
- You're going to spin us
around, right?

213
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,787
- Right there
in the hole.

214
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,162
Set i- Spin it.ole.

215
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:40,830
- Let's go!

216
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,833
- Everyone, go,
put it up.

217
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,838
Help me up here!

218
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,631
- Get it--
I got it, I got it.

219
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,467
- Help.

220
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,678
- Watch your hands.

221
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,971
Up, got it.

222
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,806
- Got it!

223
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,475
- Wait up. Wait up.

224
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,685
- It's the same every time.

225
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,313
- Remember the course.

226
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,697
- Go!

227
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,701
- Over.

228
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,454
- Take a rest.

229
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,832
Take a rest.

230
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:28,294
- Walk this, walk this.

231
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,551
(shouting orders)

232
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:38,346
- There you go,
there you go.

233
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,269
- (Probst) Make sure you stay
together as a tribe.

234
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,607
- Step, got it,
you got it.

235
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,775
- Go, go, go.

236
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,735
- Come on, baby.

237
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:56,405
- Someone help
with the back there.

238
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,866
- You go left.

239
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,618
- Ah!

240
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,620
- Straight up,
straight up, straight up.

241
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,581
- Woo!

242
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:06,040
- Go, go, go.

243
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,293
- They're up.

244
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,753
- This is light,
now, guys.

245
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,841
- Trust me, relax your legs,
just let them follow the motion.

246
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,094
- (Probst) Make sure everybody

247
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,722
passes the line before it goes
in the hole.

248
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,767
- S- Go.up.

249
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,102
- We've got to drag it back
there, guys.

250
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,561
Drag it back.

251
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,521
- This is it, guys.

252
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:33,984
- Frank, get over!

253
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,903
- Go, go, go, go!

254
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,363
- Woo!

255
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,282
- Step.

256
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,535
- Go!

257
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,917
- Who's running up
to the top?

258
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,836
- Right here.

259
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,089
- Go now-- go!

260
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:55,965
- (Probst) You guys can't put

261
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,884
this in until all
your tribe is here.

262
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,012
- Come on, push! Push!

263
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,601
- Give it to me.

264
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,359
- Push it in the hole.

265
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,194
- Get it up!

266
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,782
- (Probst)
Two feet at the top.

267
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,660
(<i> cheering</i> )

268
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:27,121
Samburu!

- You kick ass!

270
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:29,999

Nice job, guys.

271
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,636

273
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,027
- Kim, no regrets.

274
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,028
- No regrets.

275
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,238
- No, as I say,
it was my time

276
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,531
to, you know,
basically screw up.

277
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,492
But I'm a competitor.

278
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,577
I've competed all my life, and I
just want you to know how bad

279
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,370
I feel for this.

280
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,039
And while I appreciate the great
things you're saying, you guys

281
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,208
would feel exactly the same.

282
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,835
There's nothing
more than that, you know.

283
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,046
I tried to give it my best and
it was my day to screw up, so...

284
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,715
I'm sorry.

285
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:20,716
- Well, I ain't
worried about it.

286
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,717
This is just a game.

287
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,510
- I understand.

288
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,346
- And everybody has
a boo-boo.

289
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,223
Hey, I'm proud
to be on your team.

290
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,724
- Yeah, I agree.

291
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,559
- I'm feeling in a very
vulnerable position

292
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,894
because I did fall.

293
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,562
You cannot help but be mad.

294
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,065
You say the right words, you say
to the person, "Oh, it's okay,"

295
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,401
but you know what,
it's not okay.

296
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:43,155
All things being equal among us,
it's a reason to vote me off.

297
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,963
- We almost went too long
without water.

298
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:02,383
I mean, your body
just can't take it.

299
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,802
A couple people,
it's been a week,

300
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:08,889
and there ain't nothing we
can do about that.

301
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,140
We got two freeloaders.

302
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,892
It hurts.

303
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,275
- I don't know
why I'm shaking.

304
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,109
I don't know if it's
because of

305
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,903
lack of water
or because I'm cold.

306
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,700
I'm probably the only one that
hasn't had any water.

307
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,077
It's just very bad.

308
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,954
It's like tar.

309
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,373
I have to drink it.

310
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:37,501
I have to drink.

311
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,337
God, I never thought drinking
water would be so hard.

312
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:44,133
- I think we're all worried
about Jessie, throwing up when

313
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,136
you have so little hydration to
go around is bad.

314
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,513
It's bad for her,
it's bad for us.

315
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:53,183
- I think Jessie right now is--
I think she's hurting.

316
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,185
- I want to tell you that she's
saying that she's all right.

317
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,813
- No one here
is going to tell

318
00:14:57,896 --> 00:14:59,940
whether or not they're
feeling all right.

319
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,817
If they're feeling sick, they
don't want to show anybody that

320
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,985
they're weak
because they figure

321
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,404
we're just going to
vote them off.

322
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,616
- I'll be the first to admit
that the water does not taste

323
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:13,120
great, but you just, you look
past it because you need it.

324
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,956
And not only that, if you
don't drink it, how are you

325
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,500
physically going to help us in
challenges, how are you

326
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,003
physically going to help us,
you know, survive out here?

327
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,963
Just-- it wears everybody else
down because they have to pick

328
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:23,464
it up another notch.

329
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,132
- Are you hungry?

330
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,343
You have an- No.tite at all?

331
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,969
- But if you get a little
flavor on your mouth it might

332
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:29,386
change things, right?

333
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,388
- I don't know.

334
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,016
- All right,
well, bye.

335
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,851
Just trying to help.

336
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:38,479
- The guys are being really
good, you know.

337
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,272
They said it's okay, I mean,
I don't know at this point.

338
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,276
I don't know.

339
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,505
You guys don't mind me
not helping?

340
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,422
- Are you okay?
You need help?

341
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,840
- No, I'm fine.

342
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,008
I wanted
a seat, so I'm just

343
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,593
going to grab this,
if that's okay.

344
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,762
-- Whatever.e.

345
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,515
- It's the fourth day of the
game, and things are starting to

346
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,642
heat up a little bit.

347
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:17,476
I think everybody kind of

348
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,270
realizes the seriousness
of the game.

349
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,898
So, you know, what's being said
and what's being done are

350
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:24,525
just totally
different things.

351
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,901
- You trust me?

352
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:28,070
- I trust you.
I trusted you from day one.

353
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,530
- I was thinking and hoping

354
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,865
it wouldn't have come down
to this so fast.

355
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,243
But I really like the younger
people, but I just feel like for

356
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:38,455
me to stay in the game as long
as I can, I need to be on the

357
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,707
stronger side,
and at this point

358
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,333
I feel like it's Carl,
Frank, and Linda.

359
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:49,091
- (mumbling)
...you know what I'm saying?

360
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,051
- There's never a moment when
someone is not trying to whisper

361
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,094
something in someone's ear.

362
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,221
I mean, it's insane.

363
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,264
- See those guys on the grassy
knoll over there?

364
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,933
It's a conspiracy.

365
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:59,643
- Sitting around, watching
groups of people kind of

366
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,562
whispering off to the side,
you know, you get that little

367
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,772
anxiety built up inside you.

368
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,356
- We've go- Right.ck tight.

369
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,149
- No doubt, no question.

370
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,275
- Silence is the key.

371
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,235
- Silence is the key.

372
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,278
- Silence is the key.

373
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,612
- I'm not out there
trying to

374
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,947
get anybody hurt,
but they have to understand.

375
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,450
They know what
they signed up.

376
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,493
If they thought they signed up
to go to the YMCA and roast

377
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,246
marshmallows, and maybe win a
million dollars, they're wrong.

378
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,706
- We're going for
a water run.

379
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,791
We just need four people.

380
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,209
Silas, come on,
come on.

381
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,261
- Here's the deal.

382
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:38,223
The allegiance with T, Frank and
Linda and I... strong.

383
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:42,644
And we want
you on our side.

384
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,146
- If the voting was to go along
the lines of the youth and

385
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,316
the older,
obviously would be a tie.

386
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,985
We immediately began
working on Silas.

387
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:51,987
Silas is
a strong, young man,

388
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,197
physically great for the
competition.

389
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,157
Mentally too,
he wants to be a winner.

390
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,493
He wants to
go somewhere.

391
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,662
The four of us have a common
denominator, a goal.

392
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,705
We wanted to
make this work,

393
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,333
so we picked the strongest,
and that was you.

394
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,503
- You see a strong
foursome here,

395
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,713
you see
a weak threesome here.

396
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:10,506
Where you going to
put yourself?

397
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,674
He would be
a complete fool and

398
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,385
an idiot not to stay with
the type four.

399
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,179
We like everybody, we all get
along, but we got to face the

400
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,432
reality of what we're in,
we're in a frigging game.

401
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,726
It's not
a nice game at times.

402
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,186
Nobody is going
to hate anybody.

403
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,187
- No, I know
what you mean.

404
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,188
- It's a chess match.

405
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,523
- It is, man,
I know.

406
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,192
The strongest survive,
I know the damn game.

407
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,652
Do you guys
know Linda is for sure?

408
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:32,653
- Linda is so concrete,

409
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,114
she's buried in the bottom
of the Hoover Dam.

410
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,036
- You know, sometimes you
can't be a nice guy.

411
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,204
I mean,
we're all here to win.

412
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,373
And, you know,
the nice guy

413
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:47,376
finishes last,
and that's a fact.

414
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,544
It's done.

415
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,878
- What was that?

416
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:50,879
- Strength
and honor, baby.

417
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:51,588
- You got it, buddy.

418
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,214
- We're goin', bud.

419
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,091
- Let's go home, guys.

420
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,242
- It's amazing how much
water we need.

421
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,285
You know, we haven't even
thought about having water back

422
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:24,288
at the place to wash with.

423
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:30,210
- At home, getting water
is like breathing.

424
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,088
You deserve it--
it's no big deal.

425
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:37,467
In the bush, getting water is
like receiving gold or platinum.

426
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:41,889
Here water is life, water is
everything because without it

427
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,808
you are done like that.

428
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,311
- The hardest thing I have to
say is really, I'm unaccustomed

429
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:50,898
to such physical drain.

430
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,482
You know, I'm unaccustomed to
having to work for my food,

431
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,610
you know, work for
my water.

432
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,403
Very unaccustomed to it,
and that's been hard.

433
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:59,990
- Okay, ready?

434
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,248
- I mean,
we got three strong guys.

435
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,124
I think we can help.

436
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:10,334
I mean, I brought
that gourd today.

437
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,294
It was empty, but I brought
it empty.

438
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,129
It doesn't really
weigh that much.

439
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:14,963
- Yeah.

440
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,757
- I think it's too heavy
to carry back.

441
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,507
- No, we won't be
able to carry that back.

442
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,426
There's no way.

443
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,887
- But it wouldn't shock me to
see if the guys all think that

444
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,139
they were trying to get rid of
the girls altogether.

445
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:25,474
- No, see, we can't
let that happen.

446
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,475
- Because they
want to win the challenges,

447
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,143
which is
understandable.

448
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:29,311
But it wouldn't shock me if the
four of them thought they could

449
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,606
do it better
without any of us.

450
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,443
- This game breeds paranoia.

451
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:39,154
When two people go off in the
distance, you instantly think

452
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:40,656
they're talking about you.

453
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,493
I'm like, maybe they're talking
about me and trying to vote me

454
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,661
off or something.

455
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,204
You have no idea.

456
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,384
- You know, I hate having to
talk about this stuff.

457
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,594
Tom and I
talked this morning.

458
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:06,682
He and I talked about our
three-way, you know, agreement:

459
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,350
you, Kim and me.

460
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:13,355
- You and Tom are like the two
most honest guys, or what we

461
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:13,772
think is honest,
I don't know.

462
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,857
You never know.

463
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,360
- Well, Tom and I basically
promised on our son's names.

464
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,695
That was enough
for him and I.

465
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,072
But, I mean, that's what I
wanted to talk to you about.

466
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,366
We're comfortable enough with
you if you want to be part of it

467
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,369
to be making a long-term
three-way alliance.

468
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,870
- There's no other way.

469
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,623
I mean, if it's the three of us,
and we don't cannibalize each

470
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,874
other until it's three.

471
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,167
- Right.

472
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,335
- Everyone trusts Lex.

473
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,545
He's on everyone's
team right now.

474
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,089
He's on everyone's side,
everyone likes him.

475
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:42,884
So it's very easy if you're
in that position to push things

476
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,220
in one direction.

477
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:46,596
That's why I'm a little
paranoid.

478
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,766
For all I know, you know, Lex is
playing both sides of the fence,

479
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,185
you know, Lex is plotting
against me.

480
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,186
I have no idea.

481
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,563
- Get up on that horse.

482
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:58,066
Yah, yah.

483
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,860
Let me lead the way,
turn around.

484
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,070
Let me get us home.

485
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:02,612
You good, Clarence?

486
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:06,324
- Yeah.

487
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,891
- Good to be back.

488
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:31,641
- How is the water?

489
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,769
- Good, real good.

490
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,771
- Good, good.

491
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,315
Yeah... yeah.

492
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:48,450
- Silas came back from the
watering hole and I felt just

493
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,619
that little bit of apprehension
and I just got kind of curious

494
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,913
because I'm
thinking, hmm...

495
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,082
I just want to know
what's going on.

496
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,626
You know what, I'm not letting
him stay out there alone.

497
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:58,960
- Go.

498
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,466
- It's got to be done
right now.

499
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,968
- Lindsey's
concerned already.

500
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,179
She knows - I know.e talking.

501
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:12,641
Kimmy, if she whines, Brandon,
he's out of here.

502
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:16,478
- You have to be careful
when you talk like that.

503
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,021
So you're not overheard.

504
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,314
Lindsey overheard you.

505
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,191
- That's when the game really

506
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,943
became real to me, you know?

507
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:25,862
I thought I was out here on a
camping trip, just having a good

508
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:29,241
time with a bunch of friends,
and to be honest, I don't think

509
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,827
I trust anybody now.

510
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,828
- You ready?

511
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,663
- Firewood?

512
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,332
- There were
some discussions.

513
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,334
The younger group overheard
somehow.

514
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:42,170
We got sloppy
and they began to panic.

515
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,506
- It's just, you guys come back
and you're all happy and chipper

516
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,966
and you're conniving
against us.

517
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,676
- Lindsey heard Frank say that
Silas was on board with us.

518
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,178
- You heard that?

519
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,013
- I heard every word of it,
I was standing right there.

520
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,350
- Of course, me being direct and
not wanting to be dishonest,

521
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,519
all I could say was, yeah.

522
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,228
- She realized
something was going on

523
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,521
because she caught me
here.

524
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,981
- And Lindsey...

525
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,774
- And she's with Silas now, so
she knows something's up.

526
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,026
- She's all upset,
you can see it.

527
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,902
- Listen to me.

528
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,654
You better not
get me voted out here.

529
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,531
- Look at me,
come on, damn it.

530
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,991
- - Trust me.w.

531
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,868
We have got to be able
to knock people out.

532
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,369
I think Frank
should go first.

533
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,704
We're going to take it
all the way.

534
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,665
Trust me, get Kim
and Brandon to trust you.

535
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,667
- Are you telling this to
everyone?

536
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,710
No, I'm serious.

537
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,212
- I have a lot
riding on Silas,

538
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:28,175
and honestly,
I have no other choice.

539
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,342
- Trust me on this,
all right?

540
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,552
Do you trust me?

541
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,553
If you trust me.

542
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,555
- Yeah, damn it, let's go,
all right?

543
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,557
- Who knows what Silas is
really up to?

544
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,225
For all I know,
Silas is over

545
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,394
there with them and we're all
going to get screwed.

546
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,396
You know, you just have to roll
with the punches.

547
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:42,814
- I'll keep
working on Silas.

548
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,108
- Silas is fine,
he's no dummy.

549
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,569
- Silas is on
our team all the way.

550
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,362
He'll play the other
people too

551
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,990
because he's going to go where
he feels is the power.

552
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:52,782
But he's going to join us.

553
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,784
Now, do I trust him?
Hell, no.

554
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,537
- It's like this double face

555
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,915
thing you have to play while
you're out here.

556
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,584
It's funny, I mean, we're here
to win a million dollars.

557
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,793
So, I'm going to do
what it takes to win.

558
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,921
I don't know,
it's interesting.

559
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,006
Things are changing
all the time.

560
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,972
♪♪

561
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,484
- All right, let's see.

562
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,777
Oh, ho.

563
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,071
Here we go.

564

"You've all been affected
by food not collected,

00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:36,826

invited to our cafe.

"You might be elected as the

568
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,834
It's a food one!

569
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,962
- It's a gross
food challenge!

570
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,255
- That's all right,
I like that.

571
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,340
- Bring it on, all right!

572
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,801
- I don't think anyone is
squeamish, do you?

573
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,262
My one would be Jess, just
because she doesn't feel well.

574
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,304
But as long as she
gets it down.

575
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,472
- Yeah.

576
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,474
- Tree mail
said that we have

577
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,101
our disgusting food
challenge today.

578
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,227
There's nothing I won't eat.

579
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,770
You know,
it could be beef brain,

580
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:07,274
goat... testicles,
whatever.

581
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,317
Sounds good--
breakfast.

582
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,737
- "You might be elected as the
next one ejected if you find

583

584
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,284
- Food!

585
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:17,826
- Yes!

586
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,744
Yes, we can do this!

587
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,289
- That's good!

588
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,000
- I don't think
I could eat a dung beetle.

589
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,835
- Just don't think of them as
dung beetles.

590
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:27,836
Think of them
as beetles.

591
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,631
- I'll eat them right up.

592
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,384
- Winning today is really
important because if we don't

593
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:38,471
win, then I stand a good chance
of being booted out of the tribe

594
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,848
just due to the incidents
that have happened

595
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,891
in the past three days.

596
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:42,851
So, I have to eat everything.

597
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,228
I don't have a choice.

598
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,688
I'll eat dirt right now,
if you want me to,

599
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,024
I mean, whatever it takes.

600
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,367
- (Probst) Hello.

601
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,243
- Hello!

602
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,537
- Welcome to the Damu Bar.

603
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,705
Before we get to today's

604
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,666
immunity challenge, let me take
the idol back.

605
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,709
How was it having
this for the first time?

606
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:08,710
- O- Great.ng.

607
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,212
- Very secure.

608
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,673
- (Probst) This is what's up for
grabs again today.

609
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,008
I'll put this back here.

610
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:20,847
Today's immunity challenge
is a real delight.

611
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:25,185
You're going to feast like the
tribes out here in East Africa

612
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,562
have feasted for
thousands of years.

613
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:30,607
They don't really eat vegetables
and they rarely eat meat.

614
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,818
What they really rely on, milk
from cattle and blood from

615
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:38,782
cattle, and because I want you
guys to really value this

616
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:42,285
moment, we're going to show you
exactly how the tribes do it.

617
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,371
Bring it on in.

618
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:58,593
Okay, this is Charles
and some of his buddies.

619
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:01,262
They've been nice enough to loan
us one of their cows today.

620
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,848
I'm going to tell you up front,
when I first saw this done,

621
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,434
it seemed very
brutal to me.

622
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,936
I spent a lot of time
with these

623
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,771
guys and found
out exactly the opposite.

624
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,648
Cattle are revered.

625
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,442
Cattle are truly the source of
life for these tribes.

626
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:17,112
That's what they've lived
on for thousands of years.

627
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,739
They would never do anything to
endanger a cow.

628
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,450
All right, Charles.

629
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,078
What's going to happen is
something they do every single

630
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:28,164
day and how they live.

631
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:38,800
Just to assure you, we've tested
and quarantined this cow.

632
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,844
The blood
is completely clean.

633
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,430
Okay,
we're good, Charles.

634
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,308
Thank you, Charles.

635
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,978
- All right.

636
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:53,481
- (Probst) Let's go
have a drink.

637
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,985
All right, poured into a serving
container that suits you guys.

638
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,989
- Eww.

639
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:06,161
- A splash of milk.

640
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:12,167
Okay, here's how
it's going to work.

641
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,293
It's shot for shot.

642
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,627
- Yeah.

643
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,879
You got to get it down,
show me your mouth.

644
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,840
Boran, because
you guys were down one,

645
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,133
somebody is drinking
twice.

646
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,885
Whoever goes first
also drinks last.

647
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:26,848
Who's up first for Boran
and Samburu?

648
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:27,849
Come on up.

649
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,851

and mixed up.

I don't want
all that milk at the top.

Nice.

00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,302
- (Probst)
Bottoms up, guys.

697
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,262
- Go, Brandon!

698
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,096
- All right!

699
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,307
Brandon!

700
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,852
- Yeah, Brandon!

701
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,980
- (Probst) This is it.

702
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:42,108
- I have, I'm ready for more.

703
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,527
- All right, you realize
we have a tie.

704
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,987
If both of you guys do it,
if one of you doesn't do it,

705
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,113
immunity at stake.

706
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,489
- Cheers, my friend.

707
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,908
- To you, my friend.

708
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,827
- Silas, yeah!

709
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,662
- (Probst) There it is.

710
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,998
Thanks, guys,
head back to your mats.

711
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,124
We have a tie.

712
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:01,210
So we're going to have a
tie-breaker.

713
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,172
Boran, pick
somebody from Samburu.

714
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,966
Samburu, pick somebody
from Boran.

715
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,802
Strategize for a minute and
let me know who you're picking.

716
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,680
- Whoever they pick,
we're fine, we're fine.

717
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,307
- We have no choice,
We got to win here.

718
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,725
- Beautiful,
good thinking, man.

719
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:16,309
- Good thinking, Silas.

720
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:18,144
- Yeah- Let's go.got it.

721
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,479
- Let's go.

722
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:22,315
- Samburu,
who did you guys choose?

723
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,316
- Kelly.

724
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,359
- Woo!

725
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,194
- Boran, who did
you guys pick?

726
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,029
- We're going to pick the third
girl over here from the left.

727
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,073
- Linda!

728
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,494
- (Probst) Linda and Kelly.

729
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,371
For the tie-breaker, it's a
little different.

730
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,832
You're drinking
pure blood, no milk,

731
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:40,124
and it's a little bit
bigger shot.

732
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,167
- Yeah!

733
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,170
- - Cool.ht.

734
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,172
- (Probst) In this challenge,

735
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,508
first one that gets it down,

736
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,759
on my call, shows me their
tongue, wins.

737
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,928
You got to get this down
in your mouth.

738
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,513
Now, are you guys
happy that they're even?

739
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:54,931
- Yes.

740
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:55,932
- We're happy that they're
even, it's very fair.

741
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:56,683
- Get them ready.

742
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,184
Keep them down
on the ground.

743
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,144
Three, two, one, drink.

744
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,608
Keep it in.

745
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,236
- Take your time.

746
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,280
(<i> cheering</i> )

747
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,787
- (Probst) Linda.

748
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,211
Samburu.

749
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,397
♪♪

750
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:59,412
- Our camp is kind of amazed

751
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:02,623
right now because we got to
make big decisions.

752
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,752
Every time we've been in a big
situation, we falter,

753
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:08,212
and that's not okay.

754
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,340
- There's a lot of
second-guessing going on

755
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:14,469
as far as who's
valuable within our tribe

756
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,472
and who is not valuable because
we've lost actually three

757
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,141
challenges in a row.

758
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,977
- I don't know what to say.

759
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,021
- It is what it is,
I guess.

760
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:27,231
It's going to suck having to
vote someone else out, though.

761
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,320
- These challenges and these
immunities are big and,

762
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,864
you know, we're
losing by a hair,

763
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:38,326
we're losing by this much and
this much, and it's just tough.

764
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,328
It's only going to get harder.

765
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,956
- It sucks we have to
go back to the...

766
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,041
- I know.

767
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,542
- ...terrible council.

768
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,294
- Especially with how hard it
is just to exist,

769
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,004
to get your water.

770
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:53,758
We need every person
we can keep.

771
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:57,136
- I just feel like a big loser,
you know.

772
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,056
I couldn't chug beer in college,
and I can't chug blood out here.

773
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,849
I just, you know,
I tried my hardest.

774
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,184
I wasn't grossed out
by it.

775
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,977
I didn't think
it tasted bad.

776
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:08,564
I thought for sure it was in the
bag, you know, between Kim

777
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,067
tripping in the last
reward challenge,

778
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,403
and me failing to perform on my
challenge today, it's, you know,

779
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:17,448
it's anybody's game.

780
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,451
- The excuses are
way out of hand.

781
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,996
We got beat,
we got beat.

782
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,831
Kelly goes out to bars.

783
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:25,998
She knows how to chug
a damn beer.

784
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:26,791
She got beat.

785
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,376
- Well, that's what
I'm saying.

786
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,336
We've got to vote
for one of the

787
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:33,840
weakest links that
we feel is hurting us.

788
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:37,343
- When it comes to the
challenges, the other tribe is

789
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,053
not beating us with
their guys.

790
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,514
They're beating us with their
girls, so our girls right now

791
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,932
are just definitely
our weakest link.

792
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:47,103
But then again, I may be leaving
tonight, so at this point you

793
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,521
never know because it's not just
about what you need.

794
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:51,566
It's about
who you like as well.

795
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:54,902
- Clarence is worried to death
that the women are going to vote

796
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:58,781
against him, and we need
his back.

797
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:03,035
All the women are probably
tougher in a lot of areas,

798
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,412
but the thing about it, he can

799
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,414
carry more water
than any of the women.

800
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,124
- It's tough because
Jessie was

801
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,417
sick and she hasn't done
anything.

802
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,877
But personally,
I'll tell you right now,

803
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,379
I'd vote him off before I voted
one of the girls off.

804
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,423
- Well, I'm just telling you
face up, I voted against him

805
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,926
the first time
because I want him to know

806
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,263
it was a wake-up
call for him.

807
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:25,391
- Tribal Council
is a huge drag for us,

808
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,601
and we're going
twice in a row.

809
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:30,897
The first two Tribal Councils
Boran is going both times,

810
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,523
and none of us want to go.

811
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,934
- (Probst) After having done
this once,

812
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,143
I know you don't want
to be back here again tonight.

813
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:10,937
- No.

814
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,314
- Anybody want to own up
that this is tougher than

815
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,608
they thought, those first five
minutes out of the truck?

816
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:19,445
- Oh, my God, I never expected
anything to be this hard,

817
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,864
especially the first couple days
when we didn't have water and we

818
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,991
couldn't do anything about food
and we had to eat

819
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:24,992
a lot of the canned food.

820
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,160
We weren't able to cook
anything.

821
00:37:26,243 --> 00:37:27,203
- Are you feeling better now?

822
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,454
- Yeah,
I'm feeling great.

823
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:33,125
- (Probst) Lex, how big an issue
six days in is trust?

824
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:36,295
- Trust is probably one of
the biggest issues of all.

825
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:39,674
I mean, we all came here, eight
of us, didn't know anything

826
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:44,345
about each other, and yet we
found ourselves within the first

827
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,347
day having to depend on each
other for just the most

828
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,515
basic survival needs.

829
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,976
If you can't trust the people
that you're with,

830
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,477
that's a problem.

831
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,522
And given the fact that we have
had a couple of speed bumps,

832
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,564
it's made it
harder moving ahead.

833
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,693
- (Probst) Tom, you were very
clear last time.

834
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,320
You said, "I forgive,
but I don't forget."

835
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:04,615
- Just like a father figure,
I told Clarence exactly what

836
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,034
I felt, and exactly what
I thought.

837
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,495
We've done nothing
but do better since then.

838
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:12,540
I work closely
with Clarence,

839
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:16,002
and I think he's
proven his self here.

840
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:19,005
- (Probst) Clarence, got to ask
you, sounds like you've redeemed

841
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,382
yourself part of the way.

842
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,342
Are you still worried though
that could come up tonight?

843
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:27,013
- I think you got to put it in
perspective, in that we've only

844
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,557
been here for six days and that
incident was freshly early.

845
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,768
All of our
issues with regard

846
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,728
to me, I believe,
are in the past.

847
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,355
- Let's talk about
who feels vulnerable.

848
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,398
Kim, worried at all?

849
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,025
The reward challenge, a big

850
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,944
reward and it was pretty clear
you were dragging it.

851
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:46,240
- That splat did me in, um...
yeah, absolutely.

852
00:38:46,323 --> 00:38:50,536
All things being equal in every
other area, you figure you go

853
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:54,290
with the man at the time
who basically messed up.

854
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,542
So, you know, absolutely,
I'm scared and I'm vulnerable.

855
00:38:56,625 --> 00:39:00,379
- Kelly, last question,
you're here tonight.

856
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,882
- Because of me, I know!

857
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:03,924
It's awful.

858
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:04,717
I feel terrible.

859
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,844
It sucks too,
because it wasn't

860
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,929
something I was unprepared
to do.

861
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:09,722
It wasn't something
I was incapable of.

862
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,891
It's something
I was excited for,

863
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:14,310
and I couldn't be more
bummed, I feel awful.

864
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:16,312
It just sucks
that it fell that way.

865
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,772
- (Probst) Okay,
it's time to vote.

866
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:18,689
Jessie.

867
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,452
- Last time I wanted to vote
for Clarence and I didn't get

868
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:35,081
the chance, so I figure tonight
I'm going to set my piece and

869
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,958
vote for the person who I really
wanted to vote for last time.

870
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:55,267
- I hate to lose her because
she's so nice, but she's having

871
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:58,354
trouble holding up in these
horrible, hard conditions and if

872
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,647
she's still like that on day
five or six, I don't think

873
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,983
she's going to be able
to hold on for the long haul.

874
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,568
We need all the strength
we can get.

875
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:31,011
- I forgive,
but I don't forget.

876
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,597
This is still another
reminder.

877
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,730
- I'll go
tally the votes.

878
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,834
Once the votes have been read,
the decision is final.

879
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,335
The person will be asked to

880
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,212
leave the Tribal Council area
immediately.

881
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,547
I'll read the votes.

882
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,553
First vote.

883
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,430
Jess.

884
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,768
Clarence.

885
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,857
Jessie.

886
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,070
C.B., Clarence.

887
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,781
Two votes Jessie,
two votes Clarence.

888
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,621
Jessie.

889
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,255
It's four votes Jessie.

890
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,757
No need to read
the last vote.

891
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,092
We'll leave that a mystery.

892
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,636
You need to bring me
your torch, Jessie.

893
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,734
Jessie, the tribe has spoken.

894
00:42:11,528 --> 00:42:12,947
It's time for you to go.

895
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,664
Never is easy, is it?

896
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:24,583
Well, it does seem like
you guys have bonded.

897
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,002
Obviously,
the next few challenges--

898
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,963
critical for the
Boran Tribe.

899
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:29,880
Get to camp
and get some sleep.

900
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,258
I'll see you tomorrow.

901
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:57,032
- (Probst) Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

902
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:02,997
- (Probst) Next time on
<i>Survivor:</i>

903
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,957
Boran has some
unwelcome visitors.

904
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,542
- Go away!

905
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:09,461
- My mind said stay,
but my feet said go.

906
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,505
- Lindsey pushes herself
beyond her limit.

907
00:43:11,588 --> 00:43:14,300
- I could take a broken bone
over this.

908
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,802
- Lindsey likes to
say how strong she is.

909
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,637
Guess she's not so strong.

910
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,473
- And Boran strips down to the
bare essentials.

911
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,189
- I know why the guys made the
decision they made.

912
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,817
Obviously, they felt that they

913
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,487
needed Clarence to stay
in the challenge.

914
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,740
He's a little bit stronger
than me anyway.

915
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:43,037
And that's the decision they
made, and I am okay with that.

916
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,248
And I just wanted to tell Tom
that I love him.
