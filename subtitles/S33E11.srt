1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:02,961
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:11,261
"SURVIVOR": AT THE LAST TRIBAL
COUNCIL, THERE WAS A ROCK DRAW.

3
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:11,928
REVEAL.

4
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:14,305
>> JESSICA WAS SENT TO THE JURY.

5
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,434
AND WILLED HER LEGACY ADVANTAGE
TO KEN.

6
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,102
NINE ARE LEFT.

7
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,228
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

8
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:44,586
>> TONIGHT WAS JUST VERY
EMOTIONAL.

9
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:47,630
TO HAVE PEOPLE PICK A ROCK
RATHER THAN VOTE ME OUT OF THIS

10
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:52,010
GAME AND THEN TO HAVE JESSICA
PICK THE BLACK ROCK, IT'S AN

11
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,136
AWFUL FEELING.

12
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,808
I FEEL GUILTY AND I FEEL
THANKFUL, AND I-- I JUST FEEL

13
00:00:58,892 --> 00:00:59,976
AWFUL.

14
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,186
I JUST WATCHED SOMEONE--
EVERYTHING GET RIPPED BECAUSE OF

15
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:01,978
A ROCK.

16
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:05,064
>> DON'T PUT THIS ALL ON
YOURSELF.

17
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,316
>> WE ALL TOOK THE GAMBLE.

18
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,776
>> WE ALL MADE A CHOICE.

19
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:08,651
I'M REALLY ANGRY AT MYSELF.

20
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,822
I BURNED MY IDOL AT TRIBAL FOR
NO REASON.

21
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:17,827
AND NOW, I FIND MYSELF IN A
MINORITY WITH HANNAH, KEN, AND

22
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:18,661
ADAM.

23
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,873
SO I NEED TO FIND SOME CRACK
SOMEWHERE.

24
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:25,835
OTHERWISE, THE FIVE IS JUST
GOING TO PICK US OFF ONE BY ONE.

25
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:31,299
, STARTING WITH ME.

26
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:36,179
>> BRO, I TOLD YOU, I TOLD YOU.

27
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:40,141
>> THE TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS
AMAZING!

28
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:40,725
I LOVED IT.

29
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,185
I LOVED IT.

30
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:47,023
MAN, I FELT LIKE A WARRIOR.

31
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:52,195
>> THAT PISSED ME OFF, TOO.

32
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:56,199
>> THIS VOTE WAS ALL ABOUT DAVID
AND I GOING TO WAR TOGETHER.

33
00:01:56,282 --> 00:02:02,914
AND I DEFINITELY WON UPON
BATTLE.

34
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:06,709
>> I'M TRYING VERY HARD NOT TO
BE TOO EXCITED, BUT I FEEL LIKE

35
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,212
I'M GOING TO THE FINAL FIVE.

36
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,214
>> OH, YEAH.

37
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,423
I THINK I CAN WIN THIS GAME.

38
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:17,220
AND I'M JUST AS HAPPY I COULD
WIN THIS GAME AS I AM THAT DAVID

39
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:35,321
IS GOING TO LOSE IT.

40
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:40,368
>> I RECEIVED A GIFT THIS
MORNING, IN MY BAG.

41
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:43,913
I GOT THIS.

42
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,747
"CONGRATULATIONS.

43
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,416
YOU HAVE FOUND THE LEGACY
ADVANTAGE.

44
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:50,211
IF YOU ARE IN POSSESSION OF SOME
NOTE ON DAY 36, YOU WILL RECEIVE

45
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:53,590
AN ADVANTAGE IN THE GAME."

46
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,300
JESS, YOU ARE AMAZING.

47
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:59,387
JESS TOLD ME THAT SHE'D GIVE ME
ADVANTAGE IF SHE GOT VOTED OUT.

48
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,430
GOD, I LOVE THAT GIRL.

49
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,764
AND SHE DID.

50
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:02,849
IT'S BIG.

51
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,810
THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID
ABOUT THE POWER OF BEING

52
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,730
AUTHENTIC AND GENUINE
RELATIONSHIPS IN THIS GAME.

53
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,941
DAY 36 IF I'M STILL HERE I'M
GOING TO OPEN THIS UP AND SEE

54
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,944
WHAT IT BRINGS ME BECAUSE I FEEL
LIKE I'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD SHOT

55
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,281
TO GET MY DAUGHTER AND I A NEW
LIFE AND A BETTER LIFE AND MAYBE

56
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:32,295
WALKING AWAY WITH A MILLION
DOLLARS.

57
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:40,470
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

58
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,061
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SO WE ARE
31 DAYS INTO THIS GAME.

59
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:53,942
I THINK IT SOUNDS LIKE A PERFECT
TIME UNDE FOR LOVE.

60
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,152
>> NO WAY!

61
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:57,153
DUDE.

62
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:57,487
>> Jeff: SUNDAY, SAY HELLO TO
YOUR HUSBAND, JEFF!

63
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,489
>> WHAT!

64
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:04,577
>> Jeff: JEFF, COME ON OUT!

65
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:10,333
>> NO WAY!

66
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,502
OH, MY GOD!

67
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,672
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE HERE!

68
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,548
>> Jeff: TAKE IT IN, SUNDAY.

69
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,008
WHAT DOES THAT FEEL LIKE?

70
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:23,221
>> LIKE, YOU'RE WITH PEOPLE ALL
THE TIME BUT YOU'RE, LIKE,

71
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,180
ALONE.

72
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:27,892
THEN TO SEE SOMEONE THAT MAKES
YOU NOT ALONE.

73
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,644
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GIVE HER A
HUG.

74
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,396
TAKE A SPOT.

75
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,439
>> OH!

76
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,442
( APPLAUSE )
>> Jeff: BRET, YOU READY FOR

77
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,360
SOME LOVE?

78
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,111
>> YUP.

79
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,904
>> Jeff: HERE COMES YOUR DAD,
DON.

80
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,197
DON, COME ON OUT!

81
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,532
>> OH, BOY.

82
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,409
>> TRY NOT TO TRIP.

83
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,369
LOOK AT YOU!

84
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,203
YOU'RE LOOKING GREAT!

85
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:50,707
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

86
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,416
>> I TOLD HIM I WOULDN'T CRY.

87
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,002
>> LOOK AT YOU.

88
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,045
>> I KNOW.

89
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,507
THIS GUY IS THE BEST GUY IN THE
WORLD.

90
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,091
A GREAT FRIEND.

91
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,050
>> THERE IT IS.

92
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,053
>> TO SEE HIM HERE, HE'LL DO
ANYTHING FOR ME.

93
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,513
>> I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

94
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:06,389
>> THANKS, DAD.

95
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,766
I'M GOING TO-- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M CRYING.

96
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,560
I TOLD YOU GUYS I WOULDN'T CRY.

97
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,228
>> YOU LOSER!

98
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:14,063
YOU LOSER!

99
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:14,939
LOSER!

100
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,025
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, TAKE YOUR
SPOT BACK.

101
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:20,361
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU, DAD.

102
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,114
>> Jeff: JAY, SAY HELLO TO
YOUR SISTER MELANIE.

103
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:31,539
COME ON OUT, MELANIE.

104
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,085
>> OH, MY GOD.

105
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,796
WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU.

106
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,797
>> I KNOW.

107
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,925
>> Jeff: JAY, YOU CAN'T LET GO
OF HER.

108
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,594
YOU KEEP GRAK HER BACK IN CLOSE.

109
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:48,598
>> I HAVE TWO HALF TO MY HEART,
JEFF, AND ONE IS STANDING HERE,

110
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,808
AND ONE IS AT HOME BECAUSE MY
MOM CAN'T COME.

111
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,268
SO THAT'S MY FUEL.

112
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:52,685
THAT'S MY HEART, JEFF.

113
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,689
THAT'S MY HEART.

114
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,607
I'LL GIVE ME UP BEFORE I GIVE
HER UP.

115
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,651
>> Jeff: MELANIE, THAT'S
PRETTY POWERFUL.

116
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,321
NOT EVERY BROTHER-SISTER HAS
THIS RELATIONSHIP.

117
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:07,617
>> HE JUST HAPPENS TO KNOW WE
LOVE HIM BACK HOME AND HE'S NOT

118
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,911
ALONE, NOT EVEN ON THIS ISLAND.

119
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:10,953
WE'RE ON THERE FOR HIM.

120
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,622
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, MELANIE,
GIVE HIM A LAST HUG.

121
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,623
>> I LOVE YOU.

122
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:17,335
>> Jeff: HANNAH, YOU READY FOR
SOME LOVE.

123
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,962
>> MY MOM, I'M GOING TO SEE MY
MOM.

124
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:20,588
>> Jeff: MOM, COME ON OUT.

125
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,675
HERE COMES LIZ!

126
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:31,140
( APPLAUSE )
>> I'M OKAY.

127
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:31,974
I'M OKAY.

128
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:32,934
I'M OKAY.

129
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:33,810
>> Jeff: WOW, YOU'RE NOW
COMFORTING YOUR MOM.

130
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,437
>> Jeff: WAIT A MINUTE, THIS
IS BACKWARDS.

131
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,605
>> I'M GOOD.

132
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,649
>> Jeff: TELL ME WHAT'S GOING
ON, BECAUSE THIS IS A PRETTY

133
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,985
UNIQUE SITUATION IN THAT THE
DAUGHTER STARTED COMFORTING THE

134
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:43,528
MOM.

135
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,404
>> MY MOM IS MY HERO.

136
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,532
SHE'S THE BRAVEST PERSON I KNOW.

137
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:51,536
SHE'S-- SHE BEAT CANCER, SO,
LIKE, THE STRENGTH IS THIS

138
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,453
WOMAN.

139
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,122
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GIVE HER
ONE LAST HUG.

140
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,498
>> I'M GOOD, I'M GOOD, I'M GOOD.

141
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,666
>> BYE.

142
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,836
>> Jeff: ADAM, YOU READY FOR
SOME ROF?

143
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,711
>> YEAH.

144
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,046
YOU HAVE NO IDEA, JEFF.

145
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,840
>> Jeff: EVAN, COME ON OUT.

146
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:08,219
HERE COMES ADAM'S BROTHER, EVAN.

147
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,513
>> HI!

148
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:14,851
>> MY MOM HAS STAGE FOUR LUNG
CANCER, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S

149
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,060
GOING ON WITH MY MOM.

150
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:26,154
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AT
HOME.

151
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:32,368
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AT
HOME.

152
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:38,082
>> Jeff: ADAM, DOES IT STRIKE
YOU HOW FAST THE GAME CAN FALL

153
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,668
AWAY AND ALL YOU'RE DOING RIGHT
NOW IS FEELING LOVE OF SOMEONE

154
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:41,836
YOU KNOW YOU CAN TRUST?

155
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,670
>> YEAH.

156
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,840
I MEAN, I NEEDED TO BE HERE
RIGHT NOW.

157
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:49,385
I NEEDED MY BROTHER TO COME OUT
TODAY.

158
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:51,721
AND IF I DIDN'T GET THAT, IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY

159
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,057
DEVASTATING.

160
00:07:55,141 --> 00:08:01,230
I-- I WANT YOU GUYS ALL TO KNOW,
AND EVAN -- THEY ALREADY KNOW

161
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:06,736
THIS-- BUT I ACTUALLY HAVE AN
ADVANTAGE IN THIS GAME.

162
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:14,619
THAT ALLOWS ME TO STEAL A
REWARD.

163
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:18,581
BUT I CAN'T USE IT.

164
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,707
OKAY?

165
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,251
>> YOU'RE GOING TO WIN IT
ANYWAY.

166
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,754
>> BECAUSE I CAN'T-- I CAN'T
TAKE YOU GUYS AWAY FROM YOUR

167
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,422
LOVED ONES.

168
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:26,756
I CAN'T DO IT.

169
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,591
YOU KNOW.

170
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,636
>> YOU'RE A GOOD DUDE, BRO.

171
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,221
>> , ARE.

172
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,222
THANK YOU, ADAM.

173
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,266
>> Jeff: GIVE HIM A HUG.

174
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,600
LAWYER.

175
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:41,270
>> I WILL.

176
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,147
>> Jeff: DAVID, ARE YOU READY

00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:49,406
>> Jeff: IN THE FORM OF LOVE
IN A MASSIVE CHALLENGE.

353
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:49,907
>> THANK YOU!

354
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,411
>> CONGRATULATIONS!

355
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:58,582
( SPITTING )
>> Jeff: JAY, COME ON OVER.

356
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,211
>> NICE WORK JAY.

357
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,463
>> THANK YOU, GUYS.

358
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,174
>> Jeff: MELANIE, COME ON OVER
AND JOIN JAY.

359
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:13,055
YOU ARE ANYTHING BACK TO CAMP, A
"SURVIVOR" EXPERIENCE ALONG WAY

360
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,306
NICE BARBECUE.

361
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,226
PICK ANOTHER SURVIVOR AND THEIR
LOVED ONE TO JOIN YOU.

362
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,770
>> OH, MY GOD.

363
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:23,023
>> OKAY, I RESPECT EACH AND
EVERY ONE OF YOU AS WARRIORS,

364
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,859
BUT I MADE A PROMISE IN THE
BEGINNING OF THE GAME TO TAKE

365
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:26,318
WILL.

366
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:26,944
SO I'LL TAKE WILL.

367
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,279
>> Jeff: WILL, COME ON OVER.

368
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:33,242
MOM, COME JOIN HIM.

369
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:33,742
( APPLAUSE ).

370
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,286
>> OH, I'M LIKING IT.

371
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,582
>> Jeff: JAY, PICK ONE MORE
SURVIVOR AND THEIR LOVED ONE.

372
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,211
>> FOR THE SAME REASON, THEY
MADE A PROMISE TO ME FIRST

373
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,421
BEFORE EVERYONE OF YOU.

374
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,296
AND I HAVE TO PICK SUNDAY.

375
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,425
>> WOW, YAY!

376
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,260
>> Jeff: SUNDAY, COME ON OVER.

377
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,761
JEFF, JOIN YOUR WOMAN.

378
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,430
>> I'M SORRY, GUYS.

379
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,055
I TRULY AM.

380
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,765
>> NO, HEY--
>> FORGET IT.

381
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,102
>> Jeff: THIS IS LOOKING LIKE
A NICE GATHERING FOR A BARBECUE,

382
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,981
I THINK TOW EVEN IT OUT, IT
WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE ONE MORE

383
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:04,815
SURVIVOR.

384
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,900
>> YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME,
DUDE.

385
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:07,317
>> Jeff: AND ONE MORE LOVED
ONE.

386
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,111
>> JAY, PLEASE.

387
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,195
YOU'VE GOT TO.

388
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,238
>> OH, MY GOD.

389
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:14,616
>> Jeff: LOOK AT THAT.

390
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,784
JAY, EVERY SINGLE PERSON.

391
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,620
>> ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, I LOVE
YOU GUYS, MAN BUT THIS GUY

392
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,288
DIDN'T DO IT.

393
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,833
AND HE COULD HAVE DONE IT.

394
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:28,297
AND ME AND ADAM HAVE BEEN
BRAWLING THIS WHOLE DAMN TIME,

395
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:28,797
MAN.

396
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,592
YOU COME ON, MAN.

397
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:32,176
>> THANK YOU.

398
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:35,763
>> YOU DIDN'T DO IT, DUDE.

399
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,599
>> Jeff: ADAM AND YOUR
BROTHER.

400
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,309
EVAN, COME ON OVER.

401
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:44,521
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
EVERYBODY'S GOING BACK TO CAMP

402
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,731
TOGETHER.

403
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,274
THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO WILL SHARE
IN THE REWARD PART OF THIS ARE

404
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,108
YOU GUYS.

405
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,318
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

406
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,986
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

407
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:51,820
ENJOY THE AFTERNOON.

408
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,197
LOVED ONES I'M SORRY.

409
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,156
YOU'VE GOT TO GO.

410
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:54,823
NO LAST HUGS.

411
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:55,991
>> I LOVE YOU, MAN.

412
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:59,328
>> I LOVE YOU, DAD, SEE YOU
SOON.

413
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,455
TELL EVERYONE BACK HOME I LOVE
THEM, TOO, AND I MISS EVERYONE.

414
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,539
>> LOVE YOU.

415
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,476
>> JAY, THANK YOU.

416
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,560
>> CHEERS.

417
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,188
>> ADAM, I RESPECT YOU FOR NOT
PLAYING YOUR ADVANTAGE.

418
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:30,192
THIS WHOLE TIME ADAM HAS HAD AN
ADVANTAGE TO TAKE AWAY A REWARD

419
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,320
BUT HE WALKED OUT AND THERE AND
SAID, "LISTEN, I'M NOT STEALING

420
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,322
A FAMILY VISIT BECAUSE THAT'S
NOT RIGHT."

421
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:39,368
FOR FIVE SECONDS WE SAW THE SOFT
SIDE OF ADAM.

422
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,370
SOMETIMES I HATE YOU, AND
SOMETIMES I LOVE YOU.

423
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:52,881
BUT AT THIS MOMENT, I RESPECT
YOU, AND YOU'RE A COOL DUDE.

424
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,926
>> I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOU
GUYS EVERY SINGLE DAY.

425
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,887
>> WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
YOU, TOO.

426
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,055
>> WHAT'S GOING ON?

427
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:04,518
>> SHE STARTED HAVING SOME BAD
REACTIONS TO THE CHEMO PILL.

428
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:07,396
EVENTUALLY, THEY DECIDED THAT
THE SIDE EFFECTS SHE WAS HAVING

429
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:12,401
JUST WEREN'T WORTH THE POTENTIAL
GAIN THAT SHE MIGHT BE GETTING.

430
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:22,911
SO WE STOPPED THAT PILL AND A
COUPLE OF WEEKS LATER, THEY SAID

431
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:31,253
THAT THE INFUSION WASN'T REALLY
DOING ITS JOB.

432
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:39,386
>> SO WE HAD HER...

433
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:46,435
>> SHE'S REGAINING A LOT OF
STRENGTH.

434
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,687
>> DAMN IT.

435
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,910
>> NOTHING CAN REALLY LIGHTEN
THE LOAD BACK AT HOME.

436
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:06,455
IT'S A VERY SERIOUS SITUATION,
BUT ME AND MY PARENTS LOVE

437
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,917
"SURVIVOR" AS MUCH AS ADAM DOES,
AND HAVING HIM OUT HERE IS SUCH

438
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,127
A BOON FOR US.

439
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,588
IT DRIVES ME AND MY PARENTS
FORWARD.

440
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,797
ESPECIALLY MY MOM.

441
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,009
SHE'S GETTING SO MUCH STRENGTH
FROM KNOWING THAT HE'S OUT HERE

442
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,135
LIVING HIS DREAM.

443
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:23,263
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING SHE
WANTED ME TO LET YOU KNOW IS

444
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:27,142
THAT SHE'S GETTING SO MUCH MORE
STRENGTH FROM YOU.

445
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:28,810
>> I KNOW.

446
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:34,816
>> SHE FEELS YOU OUT HERE.

447
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,319
I'M HERE TO BRING JOY TO MY
FAMILY, TO MAKE THEM PROUD AND

448
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:42,699
TO GIVE THEM AS MUCH TO LOOK
FORWARD TO AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE.

449
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,494
AND THE BEST I DO IN THIS GAME,
THE LONGER I LAST, AND THE MORE

450
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:50,290
THAT I MAKE MY MOM HAPPY, I HAVE
TO STAY FOCUSED.

451
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:56,838
AND I HAVE TO USE THIS AS
INSPIRATION TO CONTINUE FIGHTING

452
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:57,422
OUT HERE.

453
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,842
>> SO WHAT'S UP, BROTHER?

454
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,178
>> WE JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK
YOU SO MUCH.

455
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:04,471
>> HEY, MAN!

456
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,973
DON'T WORRY, BRO.

457
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:10,018
>> LIKE, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
MUCH-- HOW IMPORTANT THIS WAS.

458
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,521
IT REALLY, REALLY MEANT A LOT.

459
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,189
AND I'LL NEVER FORGET IT.

460
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:17,859
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S EVER
GOING TO BE A WAY I CAN REPAY

461
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,528
YOU TOTALLY, BUT I'M GIVING YOU
THE ADVANTAGE, DUDE.

462
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,489
>> DAMN, BRO.

463
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:22,781
FOR REAL?

464
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,449
>> YEAH.

465
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,076
NO STRINGS ATTACHED.

466
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:26,702
NOTHING.

467
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:27,244
I JUST WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.

468
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,413
>> YO, MAN, THANK YOU.

469
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,165
THANK YOU.

470
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,919
>> I'M PLAYING FOR SO MUCH MORE
THAN A MILLION DOLLARS AND THE

471
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,046
TITLE OF "SOLE SURVIVOR."

472
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,884
THE STAKES FOR ME ARE MAYBE
HIGHER THAN FOR ANYONE WHO'S

473
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,011
PLAYED THIS GAME.

474
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:08,577
>> SEEING MY MOM MADE ME REALIZE
THAT I NEED TO START PLAYING

475
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:13,040
THIS GAME BECAUSE DESPITE THE
MOVES I MADE, DESPITE THE THINGS

476
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:16,418
THAT I'VE DONE IN THIS GAME,
PEOPLE STILL DON'T GIVE ME THE

477
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,419
CREDIT I DESERVE.

478
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:23,425
AND THAT CAN RUIN MY SHOT AT
WINNING THIS GAME.

479
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,718
>> HE DOES.

480
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,136
HE ABSOLUTELY DOES.

481
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:29,139
AND, BY THE WAY, I KNOW, LIKE,
I'M A TARGET, AND EVERYTHING,

482
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,640
BUT RIGHT NOW, LIKE, USE ME FOR
THIS VOTE.

483
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:34,227
>> DUDE, I'M TIRED OF USING
PEOPLE.

484
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:34,853
I WANT TO WORK WITH PEOPLE.

485
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:37,439
>> OKAY, GOOD, YEAH, GREAT.

486
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,984
>> TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT.

487
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,277
IT'S TIME TO FLIP THE SCRIPT.

488
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,197
THE BIGGEST THREAT OUT HERE IS
ZEKE.

489
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,949
AND IF HE GETS TO THE END, HE
WILL BEAT ANY ONE OF US.

490
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,661
IT IS VERY RISKY, BUT I DIDN'T
COME HERE TO BE DRAGGED AS A

491
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,162
GOAT.

492
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:55,791
I CAME HERE TO PLAY.

493
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,794
>> ALL RIGHT, I LOVE IT.

494
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,045
BOOM.

495
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,714
WILL TELLING ME THAT HE WANTS TO
SWING OVER TO OUR SIDE, IT WAS

496
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:08,178
LIKE MUSIC TO MY EARS BECAUSE
RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW, I'M AN

497
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:08,970
ENDANGERED SPECIES.

498
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,972
BUT I THINK WILL'S TELLING THE
TRUTH.

499
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:17,104

00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:51,114
THE SLIGHTEST SLIP, AND YOU'RE
DONE.

524
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,574
IT COULD HAPPEN QUICKLY.

525
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:57,579
YOU START TO FEEL YOUR HANDS
SHAKE A LITTLE.

526
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,290
DAVID IS THE FIRST TO DROP.

527
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,249
DAVID'S OUT.

528
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,751
TAKE A SPOT ON THE BENCH, NO
SHOT AT IMMUNITY.

529
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:07,130
WE ARE DOWN TO EIGHT.

530
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,424
THAT'S HOW FAST IT CAN HAPPEN.

531
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:13,678
IT LOOKS SO EASY WATCHING IT.

532
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:18,892
HANNAH SLIPS, BUT A NICE SAVE.

533
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:19,643
HANNAH CROPS.

534
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,771
HANNAH'S OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

535
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,064
WILL DROPS OUT OF NOWHERE.

536
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:29,110
YOU JUST LET IT UP FOR A MOMENT,
THAT TENSION RELEASE, AND THAT'S

537
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,737
WHAT HAPPENED TO BRET.

538
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,783
FOUR PEOPLE QUICKLY OUT OF THIS
CHALLENGE.

539
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:40,622
STRENGTH, CONCENTRATION, AND
TOUCH-- THAT IS THE KEY, THE

540
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,874
RIGHT FINESSE.

541
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:43,625
SUNDAY DROPS.

542
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,668
NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.

543
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:48,797
AND WE ARE DOWN TO FOUR.

544
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,301
JAY, KEN, ADAM, AND ZEKE.

545
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:57,264
ZEKE WITH A LITTLE WOBBLE, BUT A
NICE RECOVERY.

546
00:25:57,347 --> 00:26:00,850
ZEKE STRUGGLING TO STAY IN IT.

547
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,102
ZEKE DROPS.

548
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,478
ZEKE IS OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

549
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:07,315
NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY, AND WE ARE
DOWN TO THREE.

550
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,276
JAY, KEN, AND ADAM.

551
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,195
FIGHTING FOR IMMUNITY.

552
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,864
JAY WITH HIS FIRST MOVEMENT BUT
A NICE RECOVERY.

553
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,325
THIS IS ANOTHER CHALLENGE.

554
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,661
THERE IS NO FINISH LINE.

555
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,997
IT'S JUST OUTLASTING THE OTHERS.

556
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:31,798
DON'T LET THIS HOT SUN START TO
BAKE YOUR MIND.

557
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:36,303
YOU HAVE BEEN OUT HERE ONLY FOUR
MINUTES.

558
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:39,514
I KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT
LONGER.

559
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:43,059
ADAM STILL SOLID.

560
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,894
KEN, THE BIG SLIP.

561
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:49,316
JAY SLIPS AGAIN AND ANOTHER
RECOVERY.

562
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,109
KEN SLIPS A LITTLE MORE.

563
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:58,700
IF YOU LOSE YOUR CONCENTRATION,
YOU WILL DROP.

564
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,702
KEN DROPS AND WE'RE DOWN TO TWO.

565
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,830
IT IS JAY AND ADAM IN A SHOWDOWN
OF MILLENNIALS FOR IMMUNITY ON

566
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:07,709
DAY 33.

567
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,211
THIS IS "SURVIVOR" RIGHT HERE.

568
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,839
WHO WANTS IT MORE?

569
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:16,843
JAY TRYING TO KEEP TENSION ON
HIS BAR.

570
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,845
ADAM SLIPS BUT A NICE SAVE.

571
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:24,059
BOTH GUYS FEELING IT.

572
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,143
JAY DROPS.

573
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:36,905
ADAM WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY,
WILL LIVE TO SAY DAY 34.

574
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:37,906
ADAM, COME ON OVER.

575
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:43,203

578
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,580

579
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:49,959
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.

580
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,795
>> Jeff: INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
IS YOURS.

581
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:55,757

MASSIVE ACCOMPLISHMENT.

583
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,762
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 33
DAYS, YOUR QUEST TO WIN

"SURVIVOR" AND THE MILLION
DOLLARS THAT GOES WITH IT, WILL

00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:03,765
COME TO A CRASHING HALT.

HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,436
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:08,937
CONGRATS.

590
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,938
>> THANK YOU, JEFF.

591
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,899
>> ZEKE LOST THE CHALLENGE, SO
THIS IS MY MOMENT.

592
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,109
THIS IS MY TIME TO MAKE A BIG
MOVE.

593
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:18,113
OF SO THAT PEOPLE REALIZE THAT,
HEY, THIS 18-YEAR-OLD KID FROM

594
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,197
JERSEY, HE'S HERE TO PLAY.

595
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:36,005

>> CONGRATULATIONS, ADAM.

596
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,841

597
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:38,258
YOU EARNED IT.

>> THANK YOU.

599
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,803
THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE WAS
AWESOME!

600
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,972
I'M MAKING MY "SURVIVOR" DREAMS
COME TRUE.

601
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:47,934
I ONLY HAVE ONE CHECK BOX LEFT,
AND THAT'S WINNING THIS GAME.

602
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,102
AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT?

603
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:53,106
IT MIGHT ACTUALLY HAPPEN BECAUSE
I'M SAFE AT TRIBAL COUNCIL

604
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:53,982
TONIGHT.

605
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,817
I HAVE A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL IN
MY POCKET.

606
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:01,656
AND WILL WANTS TO MAKE A MOVE,
AND BLINDSIDE ZEKE.

607
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:04,492
>> WE HAVE A SOLID FIVE.

608
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,410
JUST VOTE ZEKE.

609
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:07,620
NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE SAYS, JUST
VOTE WEEK.

610
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,999
>> AND WE PRAY THAT WILL--
>> IT DOESN'T WORK WITHOUT WILL.

611
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:14,961
>> I NO LONGER HAVE A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL, SO I'M INCREDIBLY

612
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,212
VULNERABLE.

613
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:19,090
AND IT'S LIKE WILL JUST GOT HIS
DRIVER'S LICENSE, AND WE'RE ALL

614
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,509
SITTING IN THE BACK TERRIFIED
BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

615
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,803
HE'S GOING TO TAKE US FOR A
DRIVE.

616
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:32,187
BUT I THINK IT'S GOING TO WORK.

617
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,441
>> SOMETHING'S UP.

618
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,860
I HAVE THE NUMBERS SO I SHOULD
BE FEELING GREAT.

619
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:43,364
HOWEVER, THERE'S SOMETHING AMISS
AT THE VINAKA CAMP.

620
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,074
IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE THAT THE
FOUR SHOULD BE AS CALM AS THEY

621
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:51,664
ARE.

622
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:55,502
IF HE HAS AN IDOL, IT'S
MARGUERITE AS FOR ME TONIGHT.

623
00:29:55,585 --> 00:30:01,049
I KNOW DAVID IS COMING FOR ME,
BUT H AND WE NEED TO GET RID OF

624
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,217
HIM.

625
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,428
DAVID HAS A NOSE FOR IDOLS, AND
WE'RE SO CLOSE TO THE END, I

626
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,429
CAN'T TAKE THE RISK.

627
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,389
SO WE NEED TO THROW SOMEBODY
ELSE UNDER THE BUS.

628
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,057
>> WHO?

629
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:09,641
>> KEN.

630
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,893
>> LET'S DO THAT, YEAH.

631
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:18,691
>> KEN.

632
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,361
>> HOW YOU FEELING, BROTHER?

633
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:24,197
YOU GOT TWO SIDES TUGGING AT
YOU, MAN, AND IT'S TOUGH.

634
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,909
>> YEAH, WELL, I MEAN, I FEEL
LIKE THERE'S A GROUP THAT

635
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:31,579
RESPECTS ME AND A GROUP THAT
DOESN'T RESPECT ME.

636
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,332
AND THEY JUST TELL ME WHERE TO
VOTE.

637
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,124
THEY DON'T TAKE MY INPUT.

638
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,543
>> EXACTLY.

639
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:37,961
I DON'T JUST START TALKING
STRATEGY WITH ANYONE.

640
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:38,920
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

641
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:42,257
>> NOT UNTIL I HAVE AN IDEA OF
WHO THEY ARE.

642
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,009
>> I HAD A PRETTY GOOD FEELING
ABOUT WILL, BUT IT WASN'T 100%.

643
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:49,222
AND I DON'T JUST HAVE A
FIVE-MINUTE CONVERSATION, AND

644
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,932
THEN HOP IN BED WITH SOMEBODY.

645
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:55,853
I'VE GOT TO KNOW THE CORE OF A
PERSON, THEIR INTEGRITY, THEIR

646
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,689
VALUE BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO WIN
FOR MY LITTLE GIRL.

647
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:00,733
AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M
SAFE.

648
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,111
IS YOUR MOAT TOIF WORK WITH A
BETTER GROUP OR IS YOUR MOTIVE

649
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,947
TO--
>> I AM WILLING TO VOTE ZEKE

650
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,992
BECAUSE HE CAN BEAT ANYBODY IN
THIS GAME.

651
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,201
>> OKAY.

652
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:14,414
>> I GIVE PEOPLE ONE CHANCE TO
BE HONEST WITH ME, AND IF THAT

653
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,499
BREAKS, THEN I-- IT'S DONE.

654
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:21,754
>> WORKING WITH KEN IS LIKE
GETTING YOUR FINGER AND TO NAILS

655
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,131
RIPPED OUT AT THE SAME TIME.

656
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:28,136
IT'S EXCRUCIATING, BUT I WANT TO
MAKE A BIG MOVE, SO I HAVE TO

657
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,387
DEAL WITH THAT ONE.

658
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,139
>> YOU'RE ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE
I FOUND IN THIS GAME THEY FEEL

659
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,975
IS AS AUTHENTIC AS MYSELF.

660
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,310
>> YEAH, YEAH.

661
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,979
I RESPECT THAT MORE THAN YOU CAN
POSSIBLY KNOW.

662
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,982
>> I'M DEFINITELY IN WITH YOU
GUYS, AND THEY'RE WRITING YOUR

663
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:41,983
NAME DOWN TONIGHT.

664
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,151
>> REALLY?

665
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:50,116
>> THAT'S WHAT THEY JUST TOLD
ME, THEY'RE VOTING FOR YOU.

666
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:53,161
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.

667
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:57,832
APPARENTLY, ZEKE AND HIS GROUP
ARE VOTING FOR ME.

668
00:31:57,915 --> 00:32:09,010
I'M LIKE, "WHY?"
I'M NOT READY TO GO HOME.

669
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,219
>> LET'S DO IT.

670
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:14,182
>> I'M THINKING WE'RE GOOD TO
GO, THEN KEN WALKS BACK UP INTO

671
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,185
CAMP, GETS JAY, AND SAYS, "WE
NEED TO TALK."

672
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,188
AND AT THIS MOMENT, I KNOW WE'RE
ABOUT TO HAVE A RUMBLE.

673
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:25,026
>> I WENT AND HAD A TALK WITH
WILL, AND HE SAID YOU GUYS WERE

674
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:25,526
SAYING MY NAME.

675
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,153
>> WILL SAID THAT?

676
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:30,657
>> YEAH.

677
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,741
>> IS THAT WHAT WAS SAID?

678
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:32,617
LOOK AT ME.

679
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,202
I MEAN--
>> ONE MINUTE THE SOLID FIVE IS

680
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,080
GOOD TO GO, LIKE, YO, WE'RE
DOING KEN.

681
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:41,668
THE NEXT MINUTE I HAVE KEN COME
UP TO ME AND SAY WILL TOLD ME

682
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,044
YOU ARE VOTING MY NAME.

683
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:46,172
>> I WAS TESTING YOU EARLIER TO
SEE WHERE YOU ARE AT--

684
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:49,759
>> I GET IT, YOU'RE BLOWING UP
MY GAME AT THIS POINT.

685
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:54,555
>> KEN COMES TO ME AND SAYS WILL
JUST TOLD ME YOU'RE THROWING MY

686
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,807
NAME OUT THERE.

687
00:32:55,890 --> 00:33:00,395
>> THIS IS MY ISSUE, GUY, EVERY
TIME I MAKE A MOVE, OTHER PEOPLE

688
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,646
TAKE CREDIT FOR IT.

689
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:05,692
I WOULD RATHER BE PLAYING HARD
THAN BEING TAKEN TO THE END AS A

690
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:06,401
GOAT.

691
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,902
>> WE ALL KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP.

692
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:10,113
HE'S JUST A YOUNG KID TRYING TO
PROVE HIMSELF TO THE WHOLE

693
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,239
WORLD, BUT WE STILL NEED HIM.

694
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,575
>> I WANTED CREDIT FOR THIS ONE
BIG MOVE.

695
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,077
>> TELL ME THE NAME.

696
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,081
I'LL GO WITH YOU AND FIGURE OUT
HOW TO DO IT.

697
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,874
I HAVE BEEN WITH YOU SINCE DAY
ONE.

698
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:22,417
>> OKAY.

699
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,710
>> WE LOVE YOU, DUDE.

700
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,294
LET'S GET TO THE FIVE AND THEN
WE CAN BATTLE IT OUT.

701
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,504
OKAY?

702
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:29,924
>> I HAD TO TEST WILL TO SEE
WHERE HE WAS AT BECAUSE I DIDN'T

703
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:31,759
FEEL 110% COMFORTABLE WITH HIM.

704
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,593
>> OH, GEEZ.

705
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,929
>> HOW'D YOU TEST HIM?

706
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:38,599
>> BY SEEING WHERE HE STOOD,
ASKING WHERE HE WAS AT, AND

707
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:42,228
GOING TO THOSE GUYS AND SAY,
"WILL IS SAYING THIS."

708
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:46,274
>> WE HAVE THIS PLAN, AND KEN
TESTS WILL.

709
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,776
REVEALING WILL'S PLAN.

710
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,235
THAT'S NOT A TEST.

711
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,404
THAT'S A BETRAYAL!

712
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,281
>> KEN WALKED UP TO ME LITERALLY
TWO SECONDS AFTER--

713
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,157
>> HE SCREWED YOU.

714
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,284
>> IMAGINE PUTTING YOU IN THAT
SPOT?

715
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,286
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

716
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,246
SCREW IT BECAUSE WE HAVE FIVE
HERE, AND I'M DONE WITH THIS.

717
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,165
I WANT HIM GONE RIGHT NOW
TONIGHT.

718
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:06,794
>> THIS GUY PREACHESESES ABOUT
HONOR AND INTEGRITY AND HOW HE'S

719
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:11,924
THIS GREAT AND NOBLE HUMAN BEING
WITH THIS ARROGANCE, EXTREME

720
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:15,303
EGO, AND HE HAS THE AUDACITY TO
PULL THIS CRAP ON ME.

721
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,305
>> I DON'T KNOW WHY KEN CAN
THAT.

722
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,474
>> NOW WILL HAS NO INCENTIVE TO
VOTE WITH US.

723
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:23,102
>> KEN JUST SCREWED UP
EVERYTHING.

724
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:26,647
BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAVE WILL,
WHOEVER THAT ALLIANCE LED BY

725
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,025
MOBSTER ZEKE WANTS TO VOTE OUT,
THEY'RE GOING HOME.

726
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,194
>> WHAT IF DAVID PLAYS THE IDOL
FOR KEN?

727
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:33,488
>> WHO DO WE VOTE?

728
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:37,283
>>
>> SHOULD WE VOTE FOR HANNAH OR

729
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,159
KEN?

730
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,119
>> I ALREADY KNOW IT'S ME, BUT
THAT'S OKAY.

731
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,162
>> NO, I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE
ME.

732
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,164
>> ARE YOU SURE?

733
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,957
>> EVERYBODY KNOWS I'M IN THE
MIDDLE.

734
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,918
NOW I HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION.

735
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:50,213
THE LOGICAL SIDE OF ME IS
TELLING ME THIS IS MY TIME TO

736
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,214
MAKE A BIG MOVE.

737
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:55,676
BUT I AM SO ANGRY WITH KEN.

738
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,679
I WOULD LOVE TO BLOW UP HIS
GAME.

739
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:02,391
EITHER WAY, I'M IN CONTROL, AND
THERE'S NOTHING ANYONE CAN DO

740
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:06,854
ABOUT IT OPINIO.

741
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:22,745
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

742
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:28,209
MICHELLE, TAYLOR, CHRIS, AND
JESSICA, VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

743
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:32,505
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

744
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:38,010
SO, DAVID, COMING OFF OF ONE OF
THE CRAZIEST TRIBALS EVER ON

745
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,387
"SURVIVOR," HAS MUCH CHANGED?

746
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,390
OR ARE WE STILL LOCKED INTO THIS
TWO SIDES, ONLY ONE SIDE IS DOWN

747
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,058
A MEMBER.

748
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:45,268
MEMBER.

749
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,520
>>UN THERE'S NO REASON NOT TO
JUST PUT EVERYTHING OUT IN THE

750
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:51,023
OPEN BECAUSE BASICALLY, THERE
ARE TWO SIDES VYING FOR A SINGLE

751
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,441
SWING VOTE RIGHT NOW.

752
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:55,903
>> Jeff: SUNDAY, WHAT ARE THE
DIVISIONS?

753
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,113
WHO ARE THEY?

754
00:35:57,196 --> 00:36:00,408
>> BRET, JAY, ZEKE, MYSELF, AND
KEN, DAVID, ADAM, AND HANNAH.

755
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:03,369
WILL IS APPROPRIATELY SITTING IN
BETWEEN.

756
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:06,247
>> Jeff: WILL, HOW DID YOU END
UP IN THE MIDDLE?

757
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:11,419
>> WELL, MY ORIGINAL PLAN WAS TO
FLIP ON ZEKE, BUT KEN TODAY

758
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:17,049
REVEALED TO THE ENTIRE TRIBE
THIS PLAN, SO EVERYBODY KNOWS

759
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,676
BASICALLY WHAT'S GOING ON.

760
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:22,388
>> Jeff: SO, SUNDAY, THE
YOUNGEST KID OUT HERE IS MAKING

761
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:25,808
THE BIGGEST DECISION OF THE
NIGHT, AND IT IS A MASSIVE SWING

762
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:26,601
VOTE.

763
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,894
>> YOU KNOW, WILL CAME TO PLAY
HARD.

764
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:31,063
AND I FEEL LIKE HE DOESN'T WANT
TO SIT ON THE SIDELINES AND FEEL

765
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,608
LIKE ALL THE BIG KIDS DO ALL THE
WORK.

766
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:38,613
I THINK HE WAS SUEDE A LITTLE
BIT TODAY BUT WE'RE HOPING HE

767
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,196
STICKS WITH US.

768
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:39,822
>> HOLD ON HERE.

769
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,073
I WASN'T SUEDE AT ALL TODAY.

770
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:44,619
I WAS THE ONE WHO CAME TO THEM
WITH THE DECISION DISIGZ TO TRY

771
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,286
TO FLIP.

772
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,788
AND THAT'S PART OF THE ISSUE.

773
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,290
EVERYBODY TREATS ME LIKE THE
18-YEAR-OLD HOLLY KID.

774
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,500
I DON'T WANT TO BE TREATED LIKE
THAT.

775
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,962
I WANT TO BE TREATED LIKE AN
ADULT BECAUSE I AM HERE TO WIN

776
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,840
AND PLAY JUST AS HARD AS THE
REST OF YOU.

777
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,760
>> Jeff: IT IS INSULTING A
LITTLE?

778
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:01,969
>> IT IS INSULTING.

779
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,305
THIS IS INSANE THIS CRAZY SWING
VOTE WITH ME IN THE MIDDLE IS

780
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:08,935
WHAT IT TAKES FOR PEOPLE TO
REALIZE I AM A SERIOUS

781
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,102
CONTENDER.

782
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,979
>> Jeff: SO, ZEKE, EVERYBODY
AGREES THEY NEED WILL'S VOTE.

783
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,147
SO WHAT'S YOUR PITCH?

784
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,441
>> WELL, WILL, I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED TO PLAY WITH YOU IN THIS

785
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,651
GAME.

786
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:20,655
WE HAVE ALIGNED MANY TIMES, AND
WHEN TAYLOR AND JAY WERE UNDER

787
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,991
HEAT, YOU WEREN'T UNDER HEAT
BECAUSE I WAS PROTECTING YOU.

788
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,827
>> BUT EVEN THE WAY HE TALKS
ABOUT IT IT'S ALL ABOUT, "I'VE

789
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:27,995
BEEN PROTECTING YOU.

790
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:28,955
I DID THIS FOR YOU."

791
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,540
>> NO, I DON'T, I WAS SAYING
THAT IN THE LEAST.

792
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:35,878
HE SAVED MY ASS AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND IF I AM HERE

793
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:40,675
AT THE NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL, I
WILL AGAIN OWE MY LIFE TO WELL.

794
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,927
>> Jeff: JAY, WHY SHOULD HE
COME TO THIS SIDE?

795
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,680
>> HONESTLY, JEFF, I HAVE NEVER
LOOKED DOWN ON WILL.

796
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,391
I HAVE ALWAYS TALKED TO WILL AS
EQUAL TO ME AND I HAVE NEVER

797
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,394
ONCE TRIED TO TAKE CREDIT FOR
ANYTHING WE'VE DONE TOGETHER.

798
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,354
WE MADE MOVES TOGETHER.

799
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,690
WE TOOK UP ON THE MICHAELA
TOGETHER.

800
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,734
>> Jeff: DAVID, THE TOPIC OF
BIG MOVES IS VITAL TO THE GAME.

801
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:02,738
>> WILL FEELS LIKE HE REALLY HAS
TO HAVE SOMETHING ON HIS RESUME

802
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:06,325
TO SHOW AT FINAL TRIBAL SHOULD
HE GET THERE, AND RIGHT NOW, JAY

803
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,370
IS TRYING TO MAKE WILL FEEL LIKE
HE ALREADY HAS THAT.

804
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,206
BUT I'LL SAY IF HE VOTES WITH
US, HIS NAME WILL BE ON THIS

805
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:15,376
VOTE IN BIG, BOLD LETTERS AND
THAT'S SOMETHING TO PUT ON YOUR

806
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,544
RESUME.

807
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,380
>> Jeff: BRET, DAVID CLEARLY
JUST MADE A CASE TO WILL ABOUT

808
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,589
GOING WITH THOSE FOUR.

809
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,592
>> JEFF, I'LL TELL WILL RIGHT
NOW, THEY'LL BUILD YOU UP AND

810
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:24,427
VOTE YOU OUT IN A HEARTBEAT.

811
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,429
THEY'VE DONE IT SEVERAL TIMES.

812
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,346
I'M SORRY.

813
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,222
I DON'T BUY IT.

814
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,224
>> Jeff: ADAM, YOU'RE SHAKING
YOUR HEAD.

815
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:33,853
>> YEAH, OUR SIDE HAS AN EQUAL
PARTNERSHIP IN TERMS OF DECISION

816
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:36,397
MAKING AND THE MOVES THAT ARE
MADE.

817
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,358
AND WILL IS ALREADY A PART OF
THAT.

818
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,527
>> Jeff: WILL, DO YOU BUY THAT
YOU COULD HAVE FIVE PEOPLE, AND

819
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,529
EVERYONE HAS AN EQUAL SAY?

820
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,573
>> I DON'T BUY IT.

821
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,701
WHEN YOU HAVE FIVE PEOPLE,
EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BE FIGHTING

822
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:52,038
TO GET THEIR OWN VOICE HEARD,
AND FIVE PEOPLE CAN'T TAKE

823
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,205
CREDIT FOR ONE MOVE.

824
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,792
>> Jeff: HANNAH, WHAT'S THE
MISTAKE WILL, WILL MAKE IF HE

825
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:57,960
GOES WITH THIS FOUR?

826
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,587
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE'S
BEEN A LOT OF FLUFFING WILL UP

827
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,215
ON THAT SIDE TELLING HIM THAT
THEY'LL WORK WITH HIM.

828
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,967
AND THAT HE GETS CREDIT FOR ALL
THE MOVES.

829
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:07,094
>>UN WHAT, WILL?

830
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,555
OOIK NOT HERE TO FLUFF YOU AWP
ALL I WANT TO TELL YOU, DUDE,

831
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:15,394
HONESTLY, IS JUST GO WITH YOUR
GUT, BRO, SIMPLE AS THAT, AND IF

832
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:16,395
THAT'S WHAT YOU FEEL IS RIGHT,
DO THAT.

833
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,146
>> THANK YOU, MAN.

834
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:19,440
>> WILL, YOU'RE NODDING YOUR
HEAD.

835
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,942
>> WELL, IF THERE IS ONE PERSON
HERE WHO HAS SHOWED ME RESPECT

836
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,071
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE GAME, THAT
WOULD BE JAY, YEAH.

837
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,990
>> Jeff: WELL, I COULD SIT
HERE ALL NIGHT WITH YOU GUYS,

838
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:31,160
BUT IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

839
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:41,253
KEN, YOU'RE UP.

840
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:47,885
KEN, YOU'RE UP.

841
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:21,460
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

842
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,671
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

843
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:34,390
NOW WOULDN'T TIME TO DO SO.

844
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:37,184
>> SORRY, JEFF, IT WAS THE ONLY
PLACE I COULD KEEP IT TONIGHT.

845
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:37,893
>> WHAT?

846
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,353
>> I DIDN'T HAVE A BAG WITH ME.

847
00:40:39,436 --> 00:40:41,772
>> WHAT!

848
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:45,609
WHOA!

849
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:46,694
>> Jeff: OH, THIS WILL BE FUN.

850
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:50,531
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO TOUCH IT,
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

851
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,700
I'M PLAYING THIS FOR HANNAH.

852
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:58,539
>> WHAT!

853
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:01,834
>> Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

854
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:05,087
ANY VOTE CAST FOR HANNAH WILL
NOT COUNT.

855
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:10,676
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

856
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:13,679

THAT'S THREE.

871
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:45,252
THAT'S ENOUGH.

872
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:53,427
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

WELL, HERE'S THE THING ABOUT BIG
MOVES-- THEY'RE GREAT, UNTIL

881
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,909
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT GETS
PUNCHED.

882
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,661
WITH ONLY EIGHT PEOPLE LEFT,
THERE ARE A LOT OF KNOCKOUTS

883
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,746
STILL TO COME.

884
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,957
EVERYBODY NEEDS TO HAVE THEIR
GLOVES UP.

00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,832
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

886
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:24,792
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

>> IT'S POSSIBLE I WENT AFTER
DAVID AND HIS SIDE TOO EARLY.

899
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:09,128
I THINK MAYBE I WAS EXCITED TO
PLAY A LITTLE HARD.

900
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:13,340
BUT I DIDN'T COME HERE TO RIDE
COATTAILS.

901
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,342
I CAME HERE TO THROW SOME
PUNCHES AND I WASN'T GOING TO GO

902
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,845
DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT BECAUSE I
THINK WHEN YOU PLAY AT THIS HIGH

903
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:21,348
LEVEL WITH THIS CALIBER OF
PLAYERS IT JUST MAKES YOU WANT

904
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,433
TO PLAY IT BETTER AND MAYBE ONE
DAY I WILL.
