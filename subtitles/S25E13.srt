1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,502
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:02,794
"SURVIVOR"."

3
00:00:02,877 --> 00:00:04,754
>> THIS IS MY FINAL FOUR.

4
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,089
>> Jeff: THERE WAS A MAJORITY

5
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,383
OF ALLIANCE MADE UP OF MALCOLM,

6
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,342
DENISE, SKUPIN AND LISA.

7
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,052
>> IF IT'S WORKED IT WILL BE THE

8
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,762
BEST THING THAT'S HAPPENED TO ME

9
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:13,054
IN THE GAME.

10
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,056
>> Jeff: CRACKS STARTED TO

11
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:15,265
FORM.

12
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,392
>> WE CAN TAKE MALCOLM OUT AND

13
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:17,642
THE IDOL.

14
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,519
>> MALCOLM IS PLAYING A

15
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:20,770
BRILLIANT GAME.

16
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,273
I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN ON

17
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:23,565
WIN.

18
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,900
>> ABY CAME UP WITH A PLAN TO

19
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:26,234
SAVE HERSELF.

20
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:28,528
>> I WILL HAVE TO PLAY MY HIDDEN

21
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:28,862
IMMUNITY IDOL.

22
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,238
>> Jeff: ATTEMPTING TO TRICK

23
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,532
EVERYONE INTO THINKING SHE HAD A

24
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:33,241
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

25
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,869
>> IF YOU TELL A LIE LONG

26
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:36,119
ENOUGH.

27
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:36,745
EVERYBODY STARTS TO BELIEVE IT.

28
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:37,287
>> Jeff: IT WASN'T HER PLAN

29
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,580
THAT SAVED HER.

30
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,999
>> RIGHT NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME A

31
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:41,499
MILLION DOLLARS IS MORE

32
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,418
IMPORTANT THAN MY WORD.

33
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,128
DON'T BE HYPOCRITICAL.

34
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,963
>> NOBODY CAN STAND HAVING HER

35
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:47,172
AROUND.

36
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,590
SHE'S A BITCH.

37
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:49,883
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL

38
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:50,425
LISA MADE IT CLEAR WHO SHE

39
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:53,178
WANTED TO SIT TO AT THE END.

40
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:56,264
IF I HAD TO CHOOSE SOMEBODY WHO

41
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,265
DESERVES TO BE THERE OR I COULD

42
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,684
SIT NEXT TO SOMEBODY I THINK I

43
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:00,935
COULD BEAT--

44
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,228
>> I THINK I WOULD SILT NEXT TO

45
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:09,194
SOMEBODY I COULD BEAT.

46
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,863
>> Jeff: THE SIXTH MEMBER OF

47
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,531
OUR JURY, CARTER.

48
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,158
FIVE ARE LEFT, WHO WILL BE VOTED

49
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:27,670
OUT TONIGHT.

50
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,046
>> WOW, 34, GUYS.

51
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,130
>> CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.

52
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,673
>> HEY, FINAL FIVE.

53
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,758
>> FINAL FIVE IS HUGE.

54
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,760
>> THANKS FOR KEEPING ME, GUYS.

55
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:36,429
I SHOULD THINK BECAUSE--

56
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:36,763
>> ABSOLUTELY.

57
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,849
>> I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW

58
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:40,558
TO THANK YOU GUYS.

59
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:44,187
I MEAN-- I SURVIVED ANOTHER

60
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:44,395
TRIBAL.

61
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,980
I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS.

62
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:50,235
I AM OVER THE MOON.

63
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:50,610
THANK YOU AGAIN.

64
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:54,614
I MEAN, I-- I'M IN AWE, REALLY.

65
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:55,657
IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE.

66
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,200
>> ANOTHER COUPLE OF DAYS FOR US

67
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,868
ALL, RIGHT.

68
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,037
>> HEY, ONE DAY AT A TIME.

69
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,704
>> YOU GOT IT.

70
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:07,043
>> I BLUFFED WITH MY FANTASY HID

71
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:07,585
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, AND I

72
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,546
DON'T EVEN THEY BUY IT OR NOT,

73
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,090
BUT I'M GOING TO TRY TO PULL IT

74
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:15,134
OFF AT NEXT TRIBAL AGAIN AND SEE

75
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:15,426
HOW IT GOES.

76
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,177
>> THAT WAS A HARD ONE.

77
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,097
>> THAT WAS A VERY HARD ONE.

78
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,390
>> WHAT A GOOD YOUNG MAN.

79
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,309
>> YEAH, HE TOOK IT REALLY

80
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:23,852
PERSONALLY.

81
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,563
>> TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS HARD.

82
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,690
CARTER IS JUST ONE OF THE NICEST

83
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,149
GUYS YOU'D EVER WANT TO MEET.

84
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,860
>> THAT'S THE PART THAT YOU--

85
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:35,613
THE PART THAT HEEL GROW UP FROM,

86
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,865
YOU KNOW, FROM THIS EXPERIENCE,

87
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:37,615
I HOPE.

88
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:41,161
>> IT REALLY DOESN'T SEEM FAIR.

89
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,371
I MEAN, THIS GAME ISN'T FAIR.

90
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,665
BUT IF I HAD A CHOICE TO BRING

91
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:46,875
SOMEBODY THAT WAS WORTHY OF

92
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:47,500
BEING THERE OR SOMEBODY I COULD

93
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,627
BEAT, I WOULD BRING SOMEBODY I

94
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:54,424
COULD BEAT.

95
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,842
>> FINAL FIVE.

96
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:56,885
>> OH, MY GOSH.

97
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,469
>> YOU KNOW WHAT'S WEIRD IS I

98
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,597
WAS THINKING ABOUT YOU, ABI, AND

99
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,181
I THINK YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE

100
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:02,974
GONAB HERE BUT I THINK YOU

101
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,642
THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA BE HERE

102
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,560
WITH VERY DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

103
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,020
>> OH.

104
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,022
( LAUGHS )

105
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,106
IT'S.

106
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,650
>> IT'S JUST IRONIC, YOU KNOW.

107
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,526
>> IRONIC.

108
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,029
THAT'S A GOOD WORD.

109
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,405
>> AT TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT,

110
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,282
LISA SAID SHE WANTS TO GO TO THE

111
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,700
END WITH SOMEBODY SHE THINKS SHE

112
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:21,367
CAN BEAT.

113
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,452
IT WAS REALLY AN EYE OPENER THAT

114
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,330
SHE'S THINKING THAT

115
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:25,663
STRATEGICALLY.

116
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,332
SO GOOD ON HER, BUT NOW I KNOW

117
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,667
EXACTLY WHO SHE IS LOOKING FOR

118
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,169
TO TAKE TO THE FINAL THREE.

119
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,921
HER HEAD IS IN THE GAME.

120
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,506
SHE TIPPED IT OFF AND IT MAKES

121
00:03:35,590 --> 00:04:57,547
HER INTRUS GOING FORWARD.

122
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,340
DOING A LOT BETTER.

123
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:06,347
>> YEAH.

124
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:10,393
>> OKAY, I'M GONNA GO GET SOME

125
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:15,523
WATER.

126
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,113
>> SHE ANNOUNCES WITH TRUMPETS

127
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:22,739
THAT "I'M GOING INTO THE WOOD

128
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:29,537
FOR A WHILE."

129
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,791
>> ABI'S COME UP WITH THIS COCK

130
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:34,584
AND BULL STORY ABOUT HAVING AN

131
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:38,046
IDOL FOR A FEW VOTES NOW.

132
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,714
>> INTERESTING, "THANK YOU FOR

133
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,549
KEEPING ME AROUND."

134
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:42,008
VERY HUMBLE.

135
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,343
>> SHE'S KEEPING THE ACT GOING

136
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,762
AROUND CAMP THAT HE STILL HAS

137
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,638
ONE, BUT THE THREAT WAS SO HIGH

138
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,557
ON HER LAST NIGHT TO GO HOME AND

139
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,435
SHE WAS SO RELIEVED THAT SHE

140
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,062
DIDN'T, THERE'S NO WAY SHE WOULD

141
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,813
HAVE HELD ON TO IT LAST NIGHT.

142
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:56,773
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

143
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,192
IF SHE WOULD HAVE THAT

144
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,026
SURPRISED, SHE WOULD HAVE PLAYED

145
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:00,193
IT.

146
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,403
>> MALCOLM IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE

147
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,404
ANY TIME SOON.

148
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,364
HE IS DRL USING HIS HIDDEN

149
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,199
IMMUNITY THIS TIME AROUND.

150
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,451
I NEED TO MAKE SURE THE ALLIANCE

151
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,370
THAT DEFELICE AND MALCOLM HAVE

152
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,497
IS DESTROYED BECAUSE THEY ARE

153
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,539
VERY DANGEROUS TOGETHER.

154
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,541
AND IF DENISE DOES NOT WIN THE

155
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,835
NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, SHE

156
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,464
NEEDS TO GO HOME ASAP.

157
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:35,895
>> YEAH, THOSE TWO.

158
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,648
>> LISA, BE VERY CAREFUL.

159
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:39,440
DENISE, SKUPIN AND MALCOLM ARE

160
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,692
SO IN AN ALLIANCE WITH EACH

161
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,944
OTHER, AND YOU'RE SO ON THE

162
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:43,152
BOTTOM.

163
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:43,444
>> REALLY?

164
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,488
WHAT DID THEY SAY?

165
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,615
>> LISA, SHE KNOWS SHE CAN BEAT

166
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:47,782
YOU.

167
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,368
AND SHE KNOWS THAT SHE-- AND YOU

168
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,161
KNOW, MALCOLM AND SKUPIN ARE ALL

169
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,579
AT THE SAME LEVEL.

170
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:53,913
I DON'T KNOW.

171
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,581
I THINK THIS ALLIANCE OF FOUR,

172
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,999
YOU ARE TOTALLY ON THE BOTTOM.

173
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,334
I WOULD BE VERY CAREFUL.

174
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:59,669
>> I DON'T BELIEVE ABI FOR A

175
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,964
SECOND, BUT I NEED ABI CLOSE

176
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:03,589
WHETHER WE KEEP HER OR SHES ANY

177
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,467
TO THSHES ANYJURY.

178
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,971
IF WE KEEP HER I NEED HER CLOSE

179
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,931
TO TAKE TO THE END AND THAT

180
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,724
FIELD REALLY JUKED IN, BUT I'M

181
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:14,142
NOT GOING TO LIE.

182
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,768
THAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP I HAVE

183
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,019
WITH ABI.

184
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,272
IT'S ONE TO USE HER FOR MY BEST

185
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,398
GAME PLAN.

186
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:23,776
>> I KNOW THAT IF I'M VOTED OUT

187
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,653
FIVE, YOU'RE FOUR FOR SURE.

188
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,321
FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN, FROM

377
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,380
HEAD DOWN THE BEACH.

378
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,673
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

379
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:48,869
>> A MACHETE.

380
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,454
KILL THEM WHEN THEY'RE BACK.

381
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,498
>> I WAS VERY CRUSHED WHEN I

382
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,082
WASN'T PICKED TO GO ON THIS

383
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:53,290
REWARD.

384
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:57,711
IT JUST PROVES TO ME THAT, ONCE

385
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,880
AGAIN, I AM ON THE BOTTOM OF

386
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,549
WHATEVER ALLIANCE.

387
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,050
>> WE'LL MAKE THE BEST OF IT,

388
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:03,259
RIGHT?

389
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,593
>> SOUNDS GOOD.

390
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,261
>> LET'S DO IT.

391
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,971
>> TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, I

392
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,265
GOTTA GO HOME WITH DENISE.

393
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,975
DENISE IS, LIKE, A HORRIBLE

394
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:11,225
PERSON.

395
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:11,892
SO IT'S NOT A FUN DAY.

396
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,187
I WAS REALLY HEARTBROKEN,

397
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:15,437
REALLY.

398
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,272
>> OH.

399
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,106
IT'S GOING TO BE A PAINFUL

400
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:17,356
AFTERNOON.

401
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,233
IT'S LIKE THE FIRST DATE WITH

402
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,068
THE KID WHO, LIKE, PULLED YOUR

403
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:24,697
HAIR ALL TIME IN KINDERGARTEN,

404
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,990
OR SPIT IN YOUR LUNCH, AND ALL

405
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,533
OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE ON A DATE.

406
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,201
AND IT'S LIKE, WOW, OKAY.

407
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,370
SO I'M JUST GOING TO MAKE NICE.

408
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:34,206
OH, ABI, I SORRY, I KNOW YOU

409
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:34,832
WANTED TO GO.

410
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,251
>> I WANTED TO GO SO BADLY.

411
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,628
IT'S JUST, LIKE, I AM LITERALLY

412
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,046
THE SWING VOTE HERE, AND I DON'T

413
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,548
THINK THAT MICHAEL SEES IT.

414
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:43,007
IT'S KIND OF WEIRD.

415
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:43,966
>> I KNOW.

416
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,384
IT'S LIKE I JUST WANT TO GET TO

417
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,844
THE END OF THE DAY, SO I'M GOING

418
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:47,970
TO LET HER STRATEGIZE.

419
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,346
I'M GOING TO LET HER TALK ABOUT

420
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,556
HOW SHE'S THE SWING VOTE.

421
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,558
>> YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING

422
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,351
TO HAPPEN AT IMMUNITY, YOU KNOW.

423
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,437
YOU NEVER KNOW WHO'S GOING TO

424
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:56,604
WIN.

425
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,688
>> THAT'S TRUE.

426
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,982
>> NEXT TRIBAL IS MY LAST CHANCE

427
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,400
TO PLAY MY IDOL.

428
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,651
>> THAT'S TRUE.

429
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,111
SHE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT HAVING A

430
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,904
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

431
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,323
NONE OF US BELIEVES SHE HAS ONE,

432
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,198
NOT FOR A MINUTE.

433
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,241
IT'S JUST ABOUT GETTING THROUGH

434
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,660
THE AFTERNOON AND MAKING IT AS

435
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,453
TOLERABLE AS CAN BE.

436
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,538
>> ANYWAY, FOOD FOR THOUGHT.

437
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,332
>> FOOD FOR THOUGHT, FOR SURE.

438
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,000
I WANT TO HANG MYSELF, GOUGE MY

439
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,627
EYES OUT.

440
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,795
IF I COULD HAVE NEEDLES THAT GO

441
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,547
RIGHT INTO MY EARDRUMS I WOULD

442
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:30,429
BE GOOD FOR THE AFTERNOON.

443
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,642
>> I'M GOING BACK AND FORTH

444
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:35,225
BETWEEN THE CHOCOLATE AND THE

445
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,518
WHITE CHOCOLATE.

446
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,563
>> I'M GOING PIZZA, WHITE

447
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:39,855
CHOCOLATE.

448
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:40,731
PIZZA AT THE VERY TOP.

449
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,107
AFTER A SHORT LITTLE RIDE, WE

450
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:45,361
END UP ON THIS BOAT AND THERE'S

451
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,654
THIS GREAT SPREAD OF WHAT A

452
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,155
COUPLE OF US HAVE BEEN CRAVING

453
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,324
FOR A LONG TIME, WHICH IS PIZZA.

454
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:51,575
AND THEN THEY HAVE SOFT DRINKS

455
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,745
AND COOKIES, WHICH I HAVE

456
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,163
ALREADY SHOWN A WEAKNESS FOR OUT

457
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:56,455
HERE.

458
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:57,414
>> I'M DRINKING POP.

459
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,082
I HAVEN'T HAD POP IN 30 YEARS.

460
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,833
>> THAT'S AMAZING.

461
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:04,171
>> I'VE BEEN ALIVE FOR 24 YEARS,

462
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,965
NEVER ONCE SAID THE WORDS, "I'M

463
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:07,299
DRINKING POP."

464
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,552
MICHAEL SKUPIN DOESN'T EAT SUGAR

465
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,097
IN REAL LIFE AND HE OVER-ATE ON

466
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,599
SUGAR AND ACTED LIKE A DRUNK

467
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,184
CHICK AT A BAR.

468
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,186
HE'S LAUGHING AND ROLLING AROUND

469
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,396
IN HIS SEAT.

470
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,772
HE'S TRYING ON CLOTHES.

471
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,816
ALL OF A SUDDEN, MICHAEL SKUPIN

472
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:24,233
IS FUN TO BE AROUND.

473
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,443
WHO KNEW HE HAD THAT SIDE OF

474
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:26,610
HIM?

475
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,112
>> I'M LOOKING FOR SHADOWS THE

476
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,029
SIZE OF MY STOMACH.

477
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:32,032
>STOMACH.

478
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,284
WOW I HAVEN'T HAD A SODA IN 30

479
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:34,493
YEARS.

480
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,911
AND I HAD THREE OR FOUR OF

481
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:36,495
THEM-- I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER.

482
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:41,709
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE GOOD.

483
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,628
>> WE IS THIS WHOLE TEAM OF

484
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,922
LOCAL FISHERMEN TRYING TO FIND

485
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:49,174
ONE OF THESE FISH.

486
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,051
THEY FINALLY SPOT A SHADOW IN

487
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:51,969
THE WATER.

488
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,595
THEN IT TURNS OUT WE'RE NOT EVEN

489
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,264
LOOKING OVER THE BOAT AT THESE

490
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:55,431
GUYS.

491
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,725
HE HANDS A FLIPPER AND MASK.

492
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:58,684
YOU'RE GOING TO PUT ME IN THE

493
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,269
WATER WITH THE WORLD'S BIGGEST

494
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,478
FISH?

495
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,355
MY HANDS STARTED SHAKING.

496
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,940
>> OKAY, GO!

497
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,485
>> WE DOVE IN LIKE NAVY SEALs,

498
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,153
AND THE GUIDE GRABBED MY HAND,

499
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,779
AND HE POINTS.

500
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,074
AND THEN OUT OF THE BLUE, I MEAN

501
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,909
LITERALLY, POOF.

502
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,286
THIS HUMONGOUS WHALE SHARK

503
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,579
APPEARED.

504
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,290
AND IT'S SO BIG IT NEVER ENDS.

505
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,209
IT JUST KEEPS SWIMMING AND KEEPS

506
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,794
SWIMMING, KEEPS SWIMMING.

507
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,963
>> TO SEE SOMETHING THAT HUGE

508
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,549
AND TO BE AROUND SOMETHING THAT

509
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,967
POWERFUL WAS AWE-INSPIRING.

510
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,470
THAT FISH WAS JUST MASSIVE.

511
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,179
>> I'M SWIMMING WITH THIS THING

512
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,057
WITH THE DORSAL FIN THAT LOOK

513
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,017
LIKE A SHARK, AND IT'S SO

514
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,268
INTIMIDATING BECAUSE YOU THINK

515
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,145
AT ANY SECOND IT COULD JUST TURN

516
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:48,150
ON YOU AND BITE YOU, EAT YOU

517
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,819
>> OH, MY GOD!

518
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,946
A WHALE SHARK HEAD BUTTED

519
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,323
MICHAEL SKUPIN.

520
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,033
FUNNIEST THING I'VE SEEN IN MY

521
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:56,241
LIFE.

522
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,159
AND MY MIND WHAT BECOME SO

523
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,952
CALCULATING AFTER A MONTH AND A

524
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,996
HALF IN THIS GAME, I'M THINKING,

525
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,040
"OH, GREAT, ONE LESS

526
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:03,332
COMPETITOR."

527
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,792
>> YOU GUYS DIDN'T WARN ME.

528
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:05,834
I RAN RIGHT INTO IT.

529
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,503
>> YOU WERE DOWN THERE SHOW

530
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:07,711
BOATING.

531
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:08,754
WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO?

532
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:09,254
IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS

533
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,215
EXCITEMENT, I HAVE A GAME TO

534
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:11,423
PLAY.

535
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,218
I'VE BEEN THE DRIVING OF THE

536
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,053
LAST TWO VOTES AND I NEED TO

537
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,221
CONTINUE TO BE THAT.

538
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,348
ME, YOU, AND 69 ARE IN THE SAME

539
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:19,556
BOAT.

540
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,433
THE ONLY WAY ANY OF US HAS A

541
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,644
SHOT OF WINNING IS IF DENISE

542
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:24,770
ISN'T SITTING THERE.

543
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,271
THAT'S THE SITUATION WE'RE STUCK

544
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:26,480
WITH.

545
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,357
NOBODY BEATS DENISE, THE WOMAN--

546
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,483
>> EVERY TRIBAL COUNCIL.

547
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,819
>> EVERY TRIBAL COUNCIL.

548
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,153
NOBODY WORKS HARDER, AND SHE

549
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,321
HASN'T BETRAYED ANYBODY.

550
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:37,908
IT'S A BLOW-OUT IF SHE GOES.

551
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,868
BUT IF WE DO THIS, THERE'S NO

552
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,745
RISK AT ALL THE ENTIRE WAY

553
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:42,371
THROUGH UNTIL THE FINAL THREE.

554
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,998
MYSELF AND DENISE HAVE BEEN

555
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,000
TIGHT SINCE DAY ONE, BUT IN MY

556
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,252
MIND, MY BEST CHANCE TO GET TO

557
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,837
THE FINAL THREE AND TO WIN A

558
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,255
FINAL THREE IS GOING TO BE NEXT

559
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,006
TO LISA AND SKUPIN.

560
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,800
SO I NEED TO MAKE THEM GIVE ME

561
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,802
THEIR WORD ON A FINAL THREE DEAL

562
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,011
THAT CUTS DENISE OUT.

563
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:02,474
>> FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, YOU'VE

564
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,392
NEVER LIED TO ME, YOU'VE NEVER

565
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,393
LIED TO ME.

566
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,645
I'VE NEVER LIED TO HIM.

567
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,897
I LIKE CEMENTING THE DEAL.

568
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,524
HAVING SOMETHING THAT'S DONE

569
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:15,404
IS-- YOU KNOW, YOU END UP LIKE

570
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,280
PENNER-- LET ME THINK ABOUT, LET

571
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,782
ME THINK ABOUT IT, LET ME THINK

572
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:19,992
ABOUT IT AND YOU COME BACK AND

573
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:20,450
IT'S TOO LATE, LARPY.

574
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,326
MALCOLM AT THIS POINT WOULD BE

575
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,453
THE BEST PERSON TO FORM AN

576
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,371
ALLIANCE WITH FOR THE FINAL

577
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,247
THREE BECAUSE HE'S THE MOST

578
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,000
DANGEROUS TO WIN AN INDIVIDUAL

579
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:28,250
IMMUNITY.

580
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,753
SO IF HE WINS, HE HAS MORE POWER

581
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,505
IN WHO GETS TO COME TO THE FINAL

582
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:33,714
THREE.

583
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,341
>> I HAVE LOVED NOT HAVING THE

584
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,634
STRESS.

585
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:38,719
ONCE WE MADE A DECISION WITH THE

586
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,637
FINAL FOUR, NOT HAVING TO WORRY

587
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,180
OR SCRAMBLE OR STRESS.

588
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,432
SO, I MEAN, I LIKE THIS.

589
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,766
I LIKE THIS IDEA A LOT.

590
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,767
>> SHOULD WE DO IT?

591
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,393
>> I THINK SO.

592
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,352
>> SO YOU GUYS HAVE MY WORD.

593
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,438
>> ALL THE THINGSES I PROMISED

594
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:49,688
BEFORE.

595
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,648
>> THIS IS MY FINAL THREE.

596
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,067
>> THIS IS IT, FINAL THREE,

597
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:54,276
BABY!

598
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,278
>> WHOOO!

599
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,280
>> SKUPIN'S REALLY ON BOARD WITH

600
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,324
THIS, AND I DON'T HAVE A CHANCE

601
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,868
TO TRY TO TALK SOME SENSE INTO

602
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,786
HIM, SO I CAN SAY, YEAH, LOVE

603
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,787
IT, MAKES ALL THE SENSE IN THE

604
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,247
WORLD TO ME, US THREE TO THE

605
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:07,414
END.

606
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,624
AND IF IT'S THE BEST WAY FOR ME

607
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,167
TO GO, GREAT.

608
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,126
I'VE MADE A DEAL.

609
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:13,962
AND IF IT'S NOT, THEN I CAN MAKE

610
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:14,880
ANOTHER DEAL.

611
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,090
>> OH, MY GOSH!

612
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,469
>> WHAT A GREAT DAY!

613
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,699
>> WHEN I GOT UP IT WAS LIKE

614
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:43,659
WHAT WAS THAT.

615
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,994
IT WAS LIKE, ON FIRE.

616
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,121
LIKE-- WHOOO!

617
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,790
WHATEVER IT IS, IT'S DOING

618
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:50,040
SOMETHING.

619
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,208
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT JUST

620
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,294
SLEEPING WRONG ON-- IT'S--

621
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,839
AGAIN, IT STARTED SHARP BURNING,

622
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,758
LIKE INSTANT, JUST, LIKE,

623
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:00,008
BURNING.

624
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,510
>> JUST STAY CALM.

625
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:01,843
JUST BREATHE.

626
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:02,302
>> I JUST HAVE TO--

627
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:08,517
>> JUST BREATHE THROUGH IT.

628
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,810
>> THIS MORNING I GOT UP AND AS

629
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:14,773
SOON AS I MOVED, IT JUST--

630
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,441
THERE'S SHARP INCREDIBLE

631
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:16,692
STINGING.

632
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,986
IT WAS LIKE MY NECK, MY WHOLE

633
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:23,573
NECK WAS ON FIRE RIGHT HERE.

634
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,283
IT'S JUST ACHE AND PAIN.

635
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,661
LIKE, JUST-- LIKE THIS HURTS TO

636
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:30,664
JUST EVEN LIFT MY ARM AND TO

637
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:31,540
MOVE MY NECK

638
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,210
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M HAVING AN

639
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:35,919
ALLERGIC REACTION TO SOMETHING

640
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:36,461
THAT BIT ME.

641
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,046
>> THAT COULD BE A POISON.

642
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,298
>> I'VE GOT, LIKE, FANG MARKS

643
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,675
SOMEWHERE IN MY NECK.

644
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:46,263
CLEARLY IT WASN'T A MOSQUITO.

645
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:46,430
AH!

646
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,681
I'M TRYING TO TELL MYSELF TO

647
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:48,807
SUCK IT UP.

648
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,893
YOU HAVE THREE DAYS LEFT.

649
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:52,394
LIKE, SERIOUSLY.

650
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,979
IF IT'S JUST AN ALLERGIC

651
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,856
REACTION THAT WILL PASS, THEN

652
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:56,148
WE'RE GOOD.

653
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,066
BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT IT

654
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:58,233
IS.

655
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,526
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS A SPIDER.

656
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:02,612
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE

657
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:02,863
LIZARD.

658
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,823
THERE ARE TARANTULAS OUT HERE.

659
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:05,449
WE'VE SEEN SCORPIONS.

660
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:08,410
WE'VE SEEN A SNAKE GOING UP THE

661
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:08,869
TREE.

662
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:09,411
YOU FORGET THAT, YOU KNOW,

663
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,455
THERE'S STUFF EVERYWHERE OUT

664
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:11,663
HERE.

665
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,207
SO I'M JUST HOPING IT PASSES.

666
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,959
IT'S NOT GOING TO KILL ME.

667
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,837
BUT IT'S REALLY, REALLY PAINFUL

668
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,382
RIGHT NOW.

669
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,551
>> JUST PUSH OUT WHATEVER POISON

670
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:24,843
IS IN THERE.

671
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:29,139
JUST MAKE IT GO THROUGH SO FAST.

672
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:32,309
IT WILL BE COMPLETELY GONE.

673
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,061
FEEL YOUR ARMS AROUND HER JUST

674
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,772
ROCKING HER LIKE A BABY, LIKE A

675
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,690
MOTHER WOULD, BLOW ON HER WOUND.

676
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:42,069
YOU CREATED OUR BODIES AND YOU

677
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,029
KNOW WHAT TO DO, SO WE'RE ASKING

678
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:44,613
YOU TO RELIEVE THIS PAIN AND

679
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,490
HEAL THIS AND MAKE THIS GO AWAY

680
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,449
AND COMFORT HER IN THE MEANTIME.

681
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,534
>> LORD, WE HAVE A CHALLENGE.

682
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,078
WE HAVE A BIG DAY.

683
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,121
WE JUST ASK YOU, LORD, LET

684
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:53,622
DENISE FINISH THIS GAME.

685
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,041

686
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,376
IS HURT, BUT WHEN YOU HAVE AN

00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,795

I CAME HERE TO WIN A MILLION

699
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:27,906
DOLLARS.

AFTER 36 DAYS OUT HERE?

703
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,926
>> UNFORTUNATELY IT HAS NOT BEEN

704
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:48,552
A GREAT MORNING IN THE

705
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:48,844
PHILIPPINES.

706
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:49,344

00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:54,558
EFFECTS OF THAT.

710
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:57,144
SO, YEAH, IT'S BEEN A LITTLE

711
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:57,394
MISERABLE.

712
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,603
>> Jeff: ABI, FOR YOU,

00:23:58,687 --> 00:23:59,396
POSSIBLE OPENING.

IT?

719
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,569
ONE PERSON GETS INJURED, AND

720
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,571
WHILE YOU HAVE EMPATHY FOR THAT

721
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,864
INJURY, THERE'S ANOTHER PART

722
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:09,489
THAT SAYS GIVES ME A BETTER SHOT

723
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,116
AT WINNING.

724
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,784
>> THAT'S BEEN MY LIFE, GOING

725
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:13,827
AFTER OPPORTUNITY.

726
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,953

THIS NECKLACE.

735
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:26,923
I'VE HAD TO TAKE IT OFF EVERY

736
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:27,340
TIME.

737
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,384
ONCE AGAIN, IMMUNITY IS BACK UP

FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU WILL

00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,308
USE PLANKS TO CROSS A ROPE

741
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:39,561
BRIDGE COLLECTING PIECED TO A

742
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,645
MAZE.

743
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,772
ONCE YOU ARE ACROSS, YOU WILL

744
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:43,690
ASSEMBLE A MAZE AND USE A BALL

745
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,317
TO COMPLETE IT.

746
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,027

LOSERS GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL

751
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,120
WHERE AFTER 36 VERY TOUGH DAYS

752
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,705
SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT.

753
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,165
WE'LL DRAW FOR SPOTS.

754
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:07,088
WE'LL GET STARTED.

755
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,506

756
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:18,642
FINAL FOUR, SURVIVORS READY?

757
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:19,643
GO!

758
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,853
RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE, DIFFERENT

759
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:22,145
STRATEGIES.

760
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,355
GRABBING PIECES TO THE MAZE

761
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,731
ALONG THE WAY, SKUPIN HAS HIS

762
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,524
FIRST PIECE.

763
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,193
DENISE HAS HER FIRST PIECE.

764
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,277
MALCOLM HAS ONE.

765
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,487
LISA HAS ONE.

766
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,572
ABI STILL WORKING ON HER FIRST

767
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:32,781
PIECE.

768
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:33,657
IF YOU FALL OFF, YOU'VE GOT TO

769
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,493
COME BACK.

770
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,203
DENISE, EVEN WITH AN INJURY,

771
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:38,787
LOOKS TO BE MAKING A LOT OF

772
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,623
PROGRESS VERY QUICKLY.

773
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,583
ABI HAS HER FIRST PIECE.

774
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:49,256
EVERYBODY IN THIS.

775
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,757
MALCOLM HAS HIS SECOND PIECE.

776
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,509
SKUPIN HAS BOTH PIECES.

777
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:53,802
LISA HAS BOTH PIECES.

778
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,263
DENISE HAS BOTH PIECES.

779
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,973
MALCOLM RIGHT THERE WITH SKUPIN

780
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,600
IN THE LEAD.

781
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,143
MALCOLM FALLS OFF.

782
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,603
A HUGE SETBACK FOR MALCOLM.

783
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,230
HE WAS RIGHT THERE AT THE END.

784
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,400
NOW HAS TO GO BACK TO THE START

785
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,443
SKUPIN IS THE FIRST TO CROSS.

786
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:11,695
HE CAN START ASSEMBLING HIS

787
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:12,862
MAZE.

788
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:13,905
DENISE IS ACROSS.

789
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:14,781
SHE CAN START HER MAZE.

790
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,825
LISA'S ACROSS.

791
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,493
MALCOLM LOST A LOT OF TIME IN

792
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:19,995
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

793
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:20,787
IMMUNITY CHALLENGES IN THIS

794
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,622
GAME.

795
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,290
ABI'S ACROSS.

796
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,251
SHE CAN START WORKING ON THE

797
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:26,459
MAZE.

798
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,628
THIS MAZE ONLY GOES TOGETHER ONE

799
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:28,878
WAY.

800
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:29,838
AND YOU WILL KNOW BECAUSE THE

801
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,756
BALL WILL FIT THROUGH IT.

802
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,757
IF YOU FIND A ROADBLOCK, IT'S

803
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,259
NOT RIGHT.

804
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,636
IF THE PIECES AREN'T LINING UP,

805
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,762
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

806
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,181
MALCOLM DEAD LAST HAS TO REDO

807
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,143
THE ENTIRE COURSE.

808
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,561
>> WHERE IS THAT PIECE?

809
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:45,812
>> Jeff: DENISE LOOKS TO BE

810
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,314
MAKING A LOT OF PROGRESS

811
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:47,522
QUICKLY.

812
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:48,565
IF YOU WIN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU

813
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,650
ARE GUARANTEED A SPOT IN THE

814
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,319
FINAL FOUR

815
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:55,613
YOU LOSE, YOU COULD BE GOING

816
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:55,822
HOME.

817
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,324
A LOT OF PIECES WILL LINE UP,

818
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:57,782
BUT ALL OF THEM NEED.

819
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,659
HARD TO TELL IF YOU'RE RIGHT

820
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,911
UNTIL YOU'RE FINISHED.

821
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:09,002
>> HOW CAN THAT NOT FIT?

822
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,503
>> Jeff: MALCOLM IS ACROSS

823
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:10,670
NOW.

824
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,172
HE'S GOING TO GET BACK IN THIS.

825
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,798
EVERYBODY WORKING ON THE MAZE.

826
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,925
MALCOLM, YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE UP

827
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,344
SOME TIME.

828
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,595
DENISE GETTING CLOSE.

829
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:19,763
LISA TRYING TO FIGURE THIS

830
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:20,972
PUZZLE OUT.

831
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:25,477
ABI AND SKUPIN FALL A LITTLE

832
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:25,727
BEHIND.

833
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,395
>> THAT CAN'T BE, THAT CAN'T BE.

834
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,774
>> Jeff: DENISE THINKS SHE HAS

835
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:31,733
IT

836
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,319
>> UGH, THAT'S NOT IT.

837
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,820
>> Jeff: DENISE LOOKS VERY

838
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,364
CLOSE BUT SOMETHING IS NOT

839
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:37,572
RIGHT.

840
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,199
ONE PIECE CAN JAM YOU UP.

841
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,492
ONE PIECE COULD COST YOU A

842
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:41,284
MILLION BUCKS.

843
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,286
HUGE STAKES.

844
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,247
LISA, SKUPIN, ABI, FALLING OUT

845
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:46,873
OF IT!

846
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,166
NOTHING EASY ABOUT THIS

847
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,709
CHALLENGE!

848
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,712
MALCOLM, WHO FELL OUT OF THIS

849
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,381
EARLY MAKING A LOT OF PROGRESS

850
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:59,719
OUT OF NOWHERE.

851
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,638
COMING FROM BEHIND, MALCOLM

852
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,890
COMPLETES HIS MAZE, LIKE HE'D

853
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:08,603
DONE THIS MAZE 20 TIMES

854
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,772
THIS COULD BE A COME FROM

855
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:11,231
BEHIND!

856
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:20,281
MALCOLM WINS IMMUNITY!

857
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,366
MALCOLM, COME ON OVER.

858
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:26,037
<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>

859
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:29,290
SAFE AT TONIGHT'S TRIBAL

860
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:29,707
COUNCIL.

861
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:30,750
GUARANTEED A SPOT IN THE FINAL

862
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:31,793
FOUR, AND AS FAR AS I KNOW YOU

863
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,962
STILL HAVE AN IMMUNITY IDOL.

864
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,171
IT HAS TO BE PLAYED TONIGHT.

865
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,714
IT GIVES YOU HUGE POWER GOING

866
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:37,757
INTO TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL.

867
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,969
AND AFTER 36 DAYS, LISA, SKUPIN,

868
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:41,761
ABI, DENISE, SOMEBODY GOING

869
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:41,970
HOME.

870
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,264
IT'S GOING TO BE A

871
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:44,639
DISAPPOINTMENT.

872
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:45,807
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL

873
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,474
COUNCIL.

874
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,809
CONGRATS.

875
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:51,020
>> KNOWING THAT MALCOLM WON AND

876
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:54,232
IT WASN'T ABI WAS A HUGE RELIEF.

877
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:54,983
TONIGHT IS A SLAM DUNK.

878
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:58,027
THERE WILL BE NO OTHER NAME I'M

879
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,446
WRITING DOWN OTHER THAN ABI'S

880
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,822
AND THE TORTURE OF DEALING WITH

881
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:01,865
HER WILL BE DONE.

882
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,633
>> YOU CAN GRILL INDIVIDUAL

883
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:20,842
PIECES.

884
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,010
THE FIRE IS DEFINITELY HOT

885
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:31,311
ENOUGH.

886
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,021
>> ARE YOU OKAY?

887
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,147
>> IT GOT YOU THAT TIME.

888
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,732
>> JUST ONE LITTLE SPARK.

889
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:39,486
>> YOU CAN MOVE REALLY FAST.

890
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,071
>> I LOST TODAY, UNFORTUNATELY.

891
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:47,118
, TO MALCOLM.

892
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:47,952
IT'S DEVASTATING.

893
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:48,995
IT'S LIKE...

894
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,371
I'M TIRED.

895
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,039
I'M HUNGRY.

896
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,166
I'M EMOTIONALLY WEAK.

897
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:55,960
AND I GET NO CREDIT HERE.

898
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,754
BUT EVEN THOUGH I'M DRAINED, I

899
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:58,838
WILL KEEP ON FIGHTING.

900
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:03,384
SO I NEED SKUPIN AND LISA TO

901
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,345
VOTE WITH ME AGAINST DENISE.

902
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:09,599
I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE VOTE TALKING

903
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,183
ABOUT VOTING ME OFF TONIGHT.

904
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,810
THAT'S NOT A SECRET.

905
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,103
BUT I THINK IF YOU GUYS VOTE ME

906
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,230
OFF THAT'S GOING TO BE A

907
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:15,480
DISASTER.

908
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:17,315
YOU GUYS ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE A

909
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,734
CHANCE BETWEEN DENISE AND MOL

910
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:19,901
COM.

911
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:20,401
THEY HAVE SUCH A STORY.

912
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,403
HONESTLY, BRINGING ME TO FINAL

913
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,740
THREE, WITH YOU AND LISA, YOU

914
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:27,325
KNOW, I'VE BEEN VERY HUMBLE

915
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:27,534
HERE.

916
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,702
IT'S THE BEST CHANCE YOU HAVE AT

917
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:30,954
WINNING THIS GAME.

918
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,039
NO ONE IS GOING TO WANT TO VOTE

919
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:36,376
FOR ME.

920
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,378
>> YOU'D THINK IT WOULD BE AN

921
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:39,087
EASY DECISION TONIGHT.

922
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,880
IT'S NOT, BECAUSE EVERYTHING

923
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:41,923
MATTERS SO MUCH WHEN YOU GET

924
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,592
DOWN TO THE END GAME LIKE THIS.

925
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,512
AND YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER EVERY

926
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:48,680
SCENARIO IF YOU WANT TO COME OUT

927
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:49,222
ON TOP.

928
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,349
>> MY HEART'S TELLING ME IF YOU

929
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,976
GUYS TAKE DENISE OR MALCOLM,

930
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,602
THERE'S NO CHANCE.

931
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:55,687
>> THAT'S TRUE, PROBABLY.

932
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,772
I MEAN, IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.

933
00:30:57,855 --> 00:31:00,692
I HAVE TO TALK TO LISA AND MAKE

934
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,903
SURE WHERE HER HEAD'S AT.

935
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,863
ABI HASN'T DONE MUCH THAT'S

936
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,700
LIKABLE AT ALL IN A GAME WHERE

937
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,827
EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO BE LIKED

938
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:11,411
BY EVERYBODY BUT HANGING OUT

939
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:14,122
WITH ABI THE NEXT THREE DAYS

940
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,832
WOULD DEFINITELY BE WORTH A

941
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:21,004
MILLION DOLLARS.

942
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,381
>> ARE WE ALONE?

943
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:26,676
>> MALCOLM'S DOWN AT THE ROCK.

944
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:27,051
WHERE IS DENISE?

945
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:32,974
>> GETTING COCONUTS

946
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:36,269
>> WHAT IS SHE SAYING?

947
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,688
>> ME, YOU AND HER IN THE FINAL

948
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:38,896
THREE.

949
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,106
>> REALLY?

950
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,107
REALLY? !

951
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:49,115
I LIKE, MICHAEL.

952
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:54,454
SHE MIGHT GET PETE AND ARTIS,

953
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,831
BUT THAT'S IT.

954
00:31:56,914 --> 00:32:01,461
>> I KNOW.

955
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,588
>> HERE'S A QUESTION FOR YOU

956
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,213
TOTALLY ON THE SIDE.

957
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,298
FIVE IS THE LAST TIME YOU CAN

958
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,174
PLAY YOUR IMMUNITY IDOL.

959
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,468
ANY CHANCE YOU'RE GIVING THAT

960
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:13,514
PUPPY UP?

961
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,558
>> IF THE SITUATION CALLED FOR

962
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:16,225
IT, BUT--

963
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,143
>> BUT THEY WOULDN'T KEEP ABI.

964
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,187
>> THEY WOULDN'T KEEP ABI.

965
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,938
>> YEAH, NO.

966
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,899
>> I'M DOUBLE PROTECTED AT

967
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:23,441
TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

968
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:24,025
I'VE GOT THE IMMUNITY NECKLACE

969
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,027
FROM THE CHALLENGE, AND I'VE GOT

970
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,112
A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL IN MY

971
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:28,363
POCKET.

972
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,740
>> YEAH.

973
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:30,948
SO...

974
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,325
>> BUT I REALLY HAVE NO

975
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:34,118
INTENTION OF GIVING DENISE THE

976
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:34,327
IDOL.

977
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,244
THERE'S NO REASON TO.

978
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,079
SHE'S SAFE.

979
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,706
BECAUSE MYSELF, SKUPIN, DENISE,

980
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,167
AND LISA WILL ALL VOTE FOR ABI

981
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:41,376
TONIGHT.

982
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,462
SO IT MEANS MY MOM IS GOING TO

983
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,297
GET A NICE LITTLE SOMETHING TO

984
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,757
PUT ON THE SHELF FOR A LONG TIME

985
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,803
TO COME.

986
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:55,973
>> A, ABI, B, DENISE, C,

987
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:56,224
MALCOLM.

988
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,102
>> THE ONE PROBLEM IS IF MALCOLM

989
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:02,021
WINS IMMUNITY, AT THE FINAL

990
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,607
FOUR, YOU AND I ARE NOT

991
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:05,191
GUARANTEED THE FINAL THREE.

992
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:09,445
>> WE MAY NEED ME, YOU, AND

993
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,781
DENISE AGAINST MALCOLM AT THE

994
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,574
FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE

995
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,410
I WANT TO GO TO THE END WITH

996
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:15,576
ABI.

997
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,036
SOMEONE I FEEL IT WOULD BE

998
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,705
EASIER TO BEAT.

999
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,123
BUT MALCOLM WON THE IMMUNITY

1000
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,083
NECKLACE TODAY AND HE IS GETTING

1001
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:25,461
MORE AND MORE TRUSS BY THE DAY.

1002
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,462
HE COULD CONTINUE TO WIN

1003
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,423
IMMUNITY ALL THE WAY UP TO THE

1004
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,590
END, MAYBE THE WHOLE GAME.

1005
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,008
HERE HE COMES, BY THE WAY.

1006
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,927
>> TELL ME WHEN HE'S IN EAR

1007
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:33,094
SHOT.

1008
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,887
>> HE'S IN EAR SHOT NOW.

1009
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:38,474
>> AND SO WE NEED ALL AVAILABLE

1010
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,685
MANPOWER TO DEFEAT MALCOLM AT

1011
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,937
THE FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

1012
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,732
AND ABI'S NOT A SERIOUS

1013
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,359
OPPONENT, SO WE MAY NEED DENISE

1014
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,235
IN THERE TO KNOCK MALCOLM OUT OF

1015
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:53,573
THERE.

1016
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:58,369
SINCE MY BROTHER CAME OUT, HE

1017
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,413
REALLY DID KIND OF RECALBRIGHT

1018
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:01,038
ME.

1019
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,373
TONIGHT'S DECISION FOR ME IT

1020
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,041
BASED PURELY ON STRATEGY, PURELY

1021
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,253
ON PLANNING OUTAL THE DIFFERENT

1022
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,171
SCENARIOS, WHICH TRADEOFF IS

1023
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:11,048
GOING TO COST ME THE MOST, AND

1024
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,091
TRADEOFF IS GOING TO REWARD THE

1025
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:15,011
MOST, AND THEN JUST HOPING THAT

1026
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:18,598
I GUESSED RIGHT

1027
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,908
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN

1028
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:42,038
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1029
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:42,789
R.C.

1030
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:43,873
JEFF.

1031
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,125
ARTIS, PETE.

1032
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:46,334
PENNER

1033
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:49,295
AND CHARTER, VOTED OUT AT THE

1034
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:55,051
LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1035
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:56,427
LISA, MALCOLM WINS IMMUNITY.

1036
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,679
LAST I KNOW, HE STILL HAS AN

1037
00:34:58,763 --> 00:34:59,263
IMMUNITY IDOL.

1038
00:34:59,347 --> 00:34:59,847
WALK ME THROUGH WHAT HAPPENED

1039
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,724
WHEN YOU GET BACK TO THE BEACH

1040
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:01,933
TODAY.

1041
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:06,646
>> WELL, IT WAS ABI PLAYING

1042
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:07,897
"SURVIVOR" AND NOT GOING DOWN

1043
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,732
WITHOUT A FIGHT, AND PRESENTING

1044
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:13,444
SOME PRETTY STRONG ARGUMENTS.

1045
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,321
>> Jeff: SO, ABI, YOU'RE

1046
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:16,572
FEELING LIKE YOU'RE THE ONE IN

1047
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,073
TROUBLE TONIGHT?

1048
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:19,492
>> YES, MY BACK IS AGAINST THE

1049
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:19,700
WALL.

1050
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,160
>> Jeff: WITH RESPECT-- WHICH

1051
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,829
PROBABLY MEANS WITHOUT ANY--

1052
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,289
YOU'VE BEEN DETESTED, LAUGHED

1053
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,959
AT, AND THEN TOLD YOU'RE NOT

1054
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,002
LIKABLE, NOT A GOOD PERSON, HAS

1055
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,420
NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR CULTURE,

1056
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,338
YOU'RE JUST NOT NICE.

1057
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,715
NOBODY HERE WANTS YOU AROUND.

1058
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,299
THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TOLD.

1059
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,677
AND YET YOU MIGHT BE SOMEBODY

1060
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,719
GOOD TO TAKE TO THE END.

1061
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:39,595
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1062
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,014
IM THE BEST PERSON TO TAKE TO

1063
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:42,557
THE END WITH THEM, BECAUSE

1064
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,560
EVERYONE HERE CAN BEAT ME.

1065
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,895
>> Jeff: DENISE, ABI'S MAKING

1066
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:48,980
A PRETTY SIMPLE CASE.

1067
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:49,939
>> DEFINITELY, IF THAT'S THE WAY

1068
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:52,775
YOU WANT TO PLAY THE GAME OF

1069
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,152
"SURVIVOR," ABI IS THE PERFECT

1070
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,403
PERSON TO TAKE BECAUSE YOU WANT

1071
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,071
TO BRING SOMEBODY WHO TRULY

1072
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:59,073
HASN'T OUTWITTED, OUTPLAYED, AND

1073
00:35:59,156 --> 00:35:59,323
OUTLASTED.

1074
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,366
>> Jeff: YOU COULD MAKE AN

1075
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:03,911
ARGUMENT THAT ABI AZOUTWITTED,

1076
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:04,453
OUTPLAYED, AND OUTLASTED 13

1077
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,163
PEOPLE IN THIS GAME.

1078
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,373
>> YOU COULD ALSO SAY THERE WAS

1079
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,417
SOME LUCK IN THAT.

1080
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,254
TANDANG NEVER HAD TO GO THROUGH

1081
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,297
THE TRIBAL CONSILS.

1082
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:18,801
>> MY TANDANG COLORS ARE ABOUT

1083
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:19,427
TO BURST.

1084
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,095
I DON'T THINK IT WAS ALL LUCK

1085
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:23,222
THAT WE NEVER WENT TO TRIBAL

1086
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:23,431
COUNCIL.

1087
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:23,764
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1088
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,349
>> WE AVOIDED TRIKE NOT BECAUSE

1089
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,226
OF LUCK, BUT BECAUSE OF THE

1090
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,394
STRENGTH OF TANDANG.

1091
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,437
SO--

1092
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,106
>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT

1093
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:32,440
ABSOLUTELY.

1094
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,983
>> SO CLEAR THAT UP.

1095
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:34,525
>> Jeff: MALCOLM, AT WHAT

1096
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,569
POINT ARE YOU ALREADY THINKING

1097
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,237
WHO DO I WANT TO SIT NEXT TO AT

1098
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:38,613
THE END?

1099
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,280
>> WINNING THIS GAME NOW IS

1100
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,407
STARTING TO TAKE OVER A LOT OF

1101
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,367
MY THOUGHTS, AND I WANT IT AS

1102
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,994
MUCH AS ANYBODY SITTING UP HERE.

1103
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,663
SO, YEAH, WHO I THINK I CAN BEAT

1104
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:48,539
IS DEFINITELY BEING CONSIDERED

1105
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,498
RIGHT NOW.

1106
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:49,832
>> EXCUSE ME.

1107
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,793
I AM JUST LETTING YOU KNOW THAT

1108
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,421
THEY CANNOT BEAT DENISE.

1109
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:56,464
I'M JUST GOING TO SPEAK THE

1110
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,590
TRUTH.

1111
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,008
SHE'S MANIPULATIVE.

1112
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,426
SHE'S REALLY GOOD WITH HER

1113
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:00,635
WORDS.

1114
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,637
AND SHE'S A PHYSICAL THREAT AS

1115
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:02,929
WELL.

1116
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,305
>> Jeff: SO, ABI, YOU THINK

1117
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,599
DENISE COULD WIN THE GAME IF SHE

1118
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:06,974
GETS TO THE END.

1119
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,935
>> OH, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

1120
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:09,894
DENISE OR MALCOLM.

1121
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:10,519
IT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THE TWO.

1122
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,897
LISA AND SKUPIN ARE NOT WINNING

1123
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,774
THIS GAME.

1124
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:15,942
>> Jeff: SKUPIN, WHAT'S YOUR

1125
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,193
REACTION TO THAT?

1126
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,861
>> YOU KNOW, JEFF, IT'S SO MANY

1127
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:19,236
THINGS BECAUSE--

1128
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,322
>> BECAUSE YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

1129
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,783
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE A MILLION

1130
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,576
DOLLARS.

1131
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,827
>> Jeff: WOW.

1132
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,080
>> ANYWAY, JEFF, TO FINISH MY

1133
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:29,330
THOUGHT--

1134
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,707
>> YOU'RE A MORON.

1135
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,209
>> WHAT IS THE REACTION, I DON'T

1136
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:33,417
KNOW?

1137
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,794
>> YOU ARE A MORON.

1138
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:35,461
>> UNFORTUNATELY --

1139
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:37,713
>> HOLD ON, ABI CALLED YOU AN

1140
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,298
IDIOT ONCE AND A MORON TWICE.

1141
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:43,552
>> IT'S JUST, I THINK SO HER WAY

1142
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:43,970
OF COMMUNICATING.

1143
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,096
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

1144
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,764
>> HE THINKS HE'S GOING TO WIN A

1145
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:47,765
MILLION DOLLARS AT THE END.

1146
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,100
HE'S NOT.

1147
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,935
>> Jeff: LISA, IS THERE ANY

1148
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:51,519
STRATEGY THAT WOULD SAY, YOU

1149
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,146
KNOW, THE MORE THAT ABI TALKS,

1150
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,565
THE BETTER MY CHANCES?

1151
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:57,692
AND RATHER THAN SEND HER OVER

1152
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,735
THERE ON THE JURY, I'LL JUST

1153
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,738
KEEP HER NEXT TO ME?

1154
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:03,823
>> ABSOLUTELY, AND I HAVE NOT

1155
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,449
BEEN ASHAMED TO SAY OR APOLOGIZE

1156
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,994
THAT I WOULD TAKE SOMEBODY TO BE

1157
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,745
EASIER TO BEAT THAN NOBLER TO

1158
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,539
BEAT IN THE END FOR A MILLION

1159
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:11,956
DOLLARS.

1160
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:12,790
AND I MEAN THAT.

1161
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:13,416
>> AND I WOULD BE THE ONLY

1162
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:15,459
PERSON THAT YOU COULD BEAT.

1163
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,335
>> Jeff: SO IF YOU CAN'T WIN,

1164
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,088
WHY DO YOU CARE JAI CAME THIS

1165
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:19,255
FAR.

1166
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,631
I WOULD LIKE TO AT LEAST MAKE IT

1167
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,717
TO FINAL THREE.

1168
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,926
>> Jeff: MALCOLM, YOU'RE A FAN

1169
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:24,635
OF THE GAME.

1170
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:25,469
THAT HAS WORKED FOR OTHER

1171
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:25,720
PEOPLE.

1172
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:26,512
>> YEAH, AND IT'S WORKED

1173
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,431
STRAIGHT TO A MILLION DOLLARS

1174
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:29,515
BEFORE IN THIS GAME.

1175
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:30,349
SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE ABI

1176
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,768
BECAUSE SHE'S A GOAT, BE

1177
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,769
PREPARED SHE'S NOT GOING TO GO

1178
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,479
DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT AND SHE

1179
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,023
COULD DEFINITELY STILL PULL THIS

1180
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:37,273
THING OFF.

1181
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,066
>> Jeff: ABI, IS IT FAIR TO

1182
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,109
CALL YOU A LOUD MOUTH?

1183
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,235
>> I GUESS SO, YEAH.

1184
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:43,070
I'VE BEEN A LOUD MOUTH.

1185
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,447
>> Jeff: AND IS BEING A LOUD

1186
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,323
MOUTH A BAD THING OR IS THAT

1187
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,200
JUST HOW I'M PLAYING "SURVIVOR."

1188
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,368
>> IT'S NOT AD ABOUT THING.

1189
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:52,830
IT'S HOW I'M PLAYING "SURVIVOR."

1190
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,749
DENISE, SHE'S PLAYING LIKE SHE'S

1191
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:55,416
THE ELITE, THE BEST OF THE BEST.

1192
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,543
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME AND

1193
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,252
HER.

1194
00:38:58,335 --> 00:38:58,878
I'M HERE FOR A MILLION DOLLARS,

1195
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,546
I NEED IT.

1196
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:01,714
SHE'S HERE TO MAKE FRIENDS,

1197
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:01,922
CLEARLY.

1198
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,466
>> NO, I'M HERE FOR A MILLION

1199
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:03,924
DOLLARS, THANK YOU.

1200
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,427
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE.

1201
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,679
>> Jeff: OKAY, SO AS WE HEAD

1202
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:09,472
INTO ANOTHER VERY BIG VOTE, IT

1203
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:13,392
SEEMS LIKE IT IS EITHER ABI OR

1204
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:13,601
DENISE.

1205
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,102
LET'S FIND OUT WHICH WAY IT IS

1206
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:15,728
GOING TO GO.

1207
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,855
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1208
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:23,444
ABI, YOU'RE UP.

1209
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:27,364
>> YOU ARE PATRONIZING,

1210
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:27,656
JUDGMENTAL.

1211
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,366
YOU ARE JUST NOT A GOOD PERSON.

1212
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:40,002
I REALLY DON'T LIKE YOU.

1213
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,338
>> ABI IF THIS VOTE DOESN'T GO

1214
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:42,922
AS PLANNED THERE'S SOMETHING

1215
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:59,855
SERIOUSLY WRONG IN THE UNIVERSE.

1216
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,441
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

1217
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,443
VOTES.

1218
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:13,119
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1219
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,411
IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,

1220
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:19,625
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1221
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,710
OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,

1222
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:22,878
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

1223
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,088
PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED

1224
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,881
TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL

1225
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:26,173
IMMEDIATELY.

1226
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:29,802
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1227
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:38,936
FIRST VOTE, DENISE

1228
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:39,728
ABI.

1229
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:39,979
ABI.

1230
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:46,610
TWO VOTES ABE ONE VOTE DENISE.

1231
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,779
14th PERSON VOTED OUT AND

1232
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,573
THE SEVENTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

1233
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:50,739
ABI.

1234
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:51,323
THAT'S THREE.

1235
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:51,657
THAT'S ENOUGH.

1236
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,118
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1237
00:40:54,201 --> 00:41:01,876
>> GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF YOU.

1238
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,794
>> Jeff: ABI, THE TRIBE HAS

1239
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:07,548
SPOKEN.

1240
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:17,016
TIME FOR YOU TO GO

1241
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,684

TANDANG, TWO ORIGINAL MATSING.

00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:25,691
IT'S A SHOWDOWN AND SOMETHING'S

1245
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:26,734
ABOUT TO GIVE.

1246
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,819
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

1247
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:29,904
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1258

THESE FOUR SURVIVORS THIS FAR.

1262

1263
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,935

1266
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:04,647
DIDN'T SHAKE HER HAND.

1267

AFTER THE MERGE, I WAS TARGETED

1272
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,454
AS THE CRAZY LATINA, AND

1273
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,581
SOMETIMES I COME OFF REALLY

1274
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,582
DIRECT AND STRAIGHT TO THE

1275
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:24,625
POINT, BUT THAT'S THE TYPE OF

1276
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,835
PERSON I AM.

1277
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:27,920
I DON'T BEAT AROUND THE BUSH.
