00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,377
>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,504
<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:05,213
The two tribes paddled to Exile

4
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:07,132
Island and merged into one.

5
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:09,634
>> "Drop your old buffs and wear

6
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:10,260
these new ones as you paddle to

7
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,638
your home, the old Moto camp."

8
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:14,889
>> I'll probably get a turn at

9
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:15,265
the bed tonight.

10
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,934
Finally, things are looking up.

11
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:19,894
>> PROBST: When they returned to

12
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,438
Moto's beach of luxury...

13
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,063
>> What the hell?

14
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,982
>> PROBST: ...everything was

15
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:24,816
gone.

16
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:25,692
>> Oh, my god!

17
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:26,651
>> Oh, no.

18
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:27,235
This is like a bad dream.

19
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,320
>> No bed, no couch, no shelter,

20
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,406
no nothing.

21
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:32,282
>> PROBST: The new merged tribe

22
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,743
contained two alliances-- the

23
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:35,368
Four Horsemen of Alex, Edgardo,

24
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:38,246
Mookie, and the not-so-reliable

25
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,123
Dreamz...

26
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,166
>> Unless I'm mistaken, the four

27
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,083
of us are controlling this game

28
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,126
right now.

29
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,127
>> PROBST: ...and a separate

30
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,128
alliance of four.

31
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,212
>> There's a tribe within the

32
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,256
tribe-- myself, Michelle,

33
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,091
Cassandra and Yau.

34
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:50,717
>> PROBST: Leaving Stacy and Boo

35
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,765
on the outs.

36
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:57,974
Mookie finally told Dreamz about

37
00:00:58,057 --> 00:00:58,600
finding the hidden immunity idol

38
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,977
at the old Ravu camp.

39
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,480
>> But you can't say a word.

40
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,190
>> Do I look like... shut up!

41
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,733
We had a pact, and it kind of

42
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,650
made me not trust them a little

43
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,526
bit, and made me feel I'm on the

44
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,694
outskirts.

45
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:10,862
So I'm going to trust them until

46
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,405
I can't trust them no more.

47
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,577
>> PROBST: And the Four

48
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,453
Horsemen's alliance began to

49
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,287
fall apart.

50
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,163
>> They just want Stacy on their

51
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:20,705
side to take one of us out.

52
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,247
>> No way, no.

53
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,165
Point blank, no.

54
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,208
>> PROBST: In order to protect

55
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,627
themselves, Mookie and Dreamz

56
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,128
decided to go against the Four

57
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,631
Horsemen and target Stacy.

58
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:30,215
>> I'll really looking forward

59
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:31,299
to voting off Stacy.

60
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,218
She's got to go.

61
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,385
>> PROBST: At the immunity

62
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,595
challenge...

63
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:36,721
Reveal.

64
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:37,889
If you have orange go to the

65
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:38,765
orange mat.

66
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:39,724
If you have green, go to the

67
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:40,850
green mat.

68
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:41,434
A twist temporarily split the

69
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,646
tribe into two random teams.

70
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,146
Yau-Man working quickly.

71
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,190
The orange team is heading out.

72
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,526
And Yau Man proved himself a

73
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,568
valuable asset.

74
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,528
Yau-man makes a last-minute

75
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,487
switch, and it's a good thing he

76
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,530
did.

77
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,197
Orange team wins immunity and

78
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,116
reward!

79
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,369
Michelle, Stacy, Alex, Mookie,

80
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,037
Dreamz, you will not be going

81
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,247
back to camp.

82
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,206
We're heading to tribal council

83
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,667
right now.

84
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,043
At tribal council...

85
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:08,211
Ninth person voted out and the

86
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,212
third member of our jury...

87
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,214
Dreamz waffled and betrayed

88
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,340
Mookie when he voted for

89
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,675
Michelle instead of Stacy.

90
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,301
Michelle, the tribe has spoken.

91
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,429
Nine are left.

92
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,139
Who will be voted out tonight?

93
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,575
>> Guaranteed, I think, Michelle

94
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,702
or Stacy are gone.

95
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:41,828
>> Who is Dreamz more tight

96
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:44,747
with?

97
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,957
>> I don't know, because he

98
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,209
doesn't like Stacy at all.

99
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,299
>> Welcome home.

100
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,472
>> Voting suck?

101
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,473
>> Yeah, it sucked.

102
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,107
>> I guess you could say I'm

103
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,026
pretty upset right now.

104
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,360
Earlier on, Dreamz and I had a

105
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,486
conversation of exactly going

106
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,446
back to the original plan that

107
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,072
we had, that we would take out

108
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,282
Stacy.

109
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,366
But Dreamz still votes off

110
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,367
Michelle.

111
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,285
We just basically gave all the

112
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,328
power to Alex.

113
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,287
You know, we just basically

114
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,415
screwed ourselves.

115
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,458
>> I made it very clear I that

116
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,418
was voting for Michelle.

117
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,377
I thought you were, like, doing

118
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:31,753
your own thing.

119
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:32,295
I was like...

120
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,088
>> No.

121
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,006
>> Okay, that's fine.

122
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,633
It's just miscommunication.

123
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,509
But listen, the way to seal the

124
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,803
final four in blood is to take

125
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,013
the immunity idol and rotate it.

126
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,097
Each of us gets it a day, and

127
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:43,389
that way...

128
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,475
>> That does nothing.

129
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,517
>> It does, dude.

130
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,435
It does.

131
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,353
>> It doesn't do anything.

132
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,270
>> It does.

133
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:49,646
It does, Mookie.

134
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,189
Because what it tells me and

135
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,231
tells everybody is that none of

136
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,358
us can screw each other over.

137
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,484
If I... look, the three of us

138
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,568
found it together.

139
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,611
You started digging in one area,

140
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,987
I pointed to another area.

141
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,197
We were all digging.

142
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,406
You happened to be the first one

143
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,574
to touch it.

144
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,617
And now you're telling me you're

145
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,535
not going to part with it unless

146
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,995
only on your terms.

147
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:06,496
That's messed up, dude.

148
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,497
>> I'm not saying that.

149
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,331
>> That's exactly what you're

150
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,041
saying.

151
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:10,833
You're saying something

152
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:11,626
different?

153
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,128
Be honest, man.

154
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,255
>> You know what?

155
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,507
What's going to happen now is

156
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,633
Alex is like, "You know what?

157
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:19,759
You have to trust us, and we're

158
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:20,677
each going to share the immunity

159
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,552
idol.

160
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,428
We're going to hold it once

161
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:26,557
every day."

162
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,433
Then he's like, "Four Horsemen

163
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,269
is nothing."

164
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:29,560
No we can't.

165
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,188
No we don't, because they don't

166
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:33,564
trust us.

167
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,483
This is what just... you screwed

168
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,859
everything with that.

169
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:37,944
>> When we got to tribal

170
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,112
council, Michelle start talking.

171
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,405
And when she says in the tribal

172
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,365
council, "I don't know Dre,

173
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,701
I never hung around him,"

174
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,952
it kind of let me know, "Wait a

175
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:46,536
minute, I don't know her

176
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,495
neither.

177
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,121
I don't know what alliance she's

178
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,247
in."

179
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,081
So it kind of scared me a little

180
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:50,915
bit, so it caused me to vote her

181
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,000
name.

182
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,042
If she never said that, she'd

183
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,086
still be here right now.

184
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:55,545
>> You did, trust me.

185
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,588
Don't worry about it.

186
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,506
Trust me.

187
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,800
You just screwed both of us.

188
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:43,634
>> Well, the tribe, the other

189
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,720
half returned from tribal

190
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:48,681
council, and I was hoping that

191
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,516
Stacy was gone.

192
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,144
It was definitely a shock.

193
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:53,728
I was very disappointed, and

194
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,564
that just flipped the whole

195
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,774
script around for everything in

196
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,025
my head.

197
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:02,320
>> If you all want to take me in

198
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,738
as a swing vote we'll make it to

199
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:04,447
the five with me, you,

200
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,617
Cassandra, Yau-- because I know

201
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,077
you're tight with Yau, Yau's a

202
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,245
solid, solid, person-- and

203
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:11,496
Dreamz.

204
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,539
The rest of them, they're all

205
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,208
backstabbers.

206
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,044
>> I think ... I mean, as long

207
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,754
as we take out Alex first.

208
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,339
>> That's fine with me, but the

209
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,799
thing is Dreamz is not going to

210
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,383
want to take Alex out.

211
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,384
>> You think Dreamz is not going

212
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,344
to want to take Alex out?

213
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:26,761
>> He likes Alex.

214
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:27,512
>> When Boo and I had our man-

215
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,472
to-man talk and looked each

216
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,640
other in the eye and

217
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,599
said he was with me, I still

218
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,726
didn't buy it.

219
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,394
Boo is just trying to save his

220
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,896
own neck at all times.

221
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,147
But I need to know if he's with

222
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,023
us.

223
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:39,899
I mean, because we really need

224
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:40,900
his vote since we don't have

225
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,318
Michelle.

226
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:47,073
That should go a few hours.

227
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:47,657
Basically, the main core is

228
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,159
myself, Yau, and Cassandra.

229
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,536
I trust them completely.

230
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,956
Dreamz is definitely a wild card

231
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:55,665
and I don't know if I trust

232
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,542
Mookie all the way yet, because

233
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,668
he's already kind of... tries to

234
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,837
manipulate a lot as well.

235
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,506
It's that part of the chess game

236
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,507
where you've already lost a

237
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,676
couple of really good pieces,

238
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,802
and now you have to really

239
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:08,970
think.

240
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,221
You can't trust everybody.

241
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,305
But I like playing this game.

242
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,891
And I am still here.

243
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,570
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

244
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:26,028
to today's challenge?

245
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:26,612
>> Yeah.

246
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,655
>> PROBST: For today's

247
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:28,614
challenge, we're going to test

248
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,658
how in tune are you with the

249
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,618
rest of your tribe.

250
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,871
I have a series of questions.

251
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,455
Each of you are going to answer

252
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,707
these questions in private.

253
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,375
I'll tally the results, then

254
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,918
I'll explain the challenge.

255
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,254
Let's go.

256
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:50,970
Okay, I have tallied the

257
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,763
results.

258
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,307
Now I'm going ask you these same

259
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,474
questions again, only this time

260
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,518
you're trying to guess what the

261
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,103
group said-- in other words,

262
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,147
whose name came up the most

263
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,398
often.

264
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:03,482
That may differ from what you

265
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:03,774
wrote down.

266
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,651
You're looking to match the

267
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,196
group consensus.

268
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,488
Each time you get it right, you

269
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,032
get to smash another tribe

270
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:11,824
member's tower.

271
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,743
When your three towers are gone,

272
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,161
you're out of the challenge.

273
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,495
The last person left standing

274
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:16,787
wins reward.

275
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:17,747
Want to know what you're playing

276
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,664
for?

277
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,665
The winner of this challenge

278
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,418
will spend the night on a

279
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:24,295
70-foot luxury yacht.

280
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,838
>> Whoo!

281
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:26,881
All right!

282
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:27,757
>> PROBST: You'll have a snack

283
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,841
and cocktail when you get on

284
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:29,550
board, a nice barbecue.

285
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,677
You'll spend the night on the

286
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,845
yacht in a comfortable bed.

287
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,472
In addition, the winner of this

288
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,556
challenge will send one person

289
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,724
to Exile Island.

290
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,601
Worth playing for?

291
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:38,851
>> Yeah.

292
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:39,685
>> Yeah.

293
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,980
>> PROBST: We'll get started.

294
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,984
All right, so remember, you're

295
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:47,777
looking to match the consensus

296
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,196
as a group whose name came up

297
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,906
the most often.

298
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,617
First question-- who would you

299
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,703
trust with your life?

300
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,456
Reveal.

301
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:02,750
The answer most commonly given

302
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,919
by the group was Earl.

303
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,712
Yau-Man got it right.

304
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,172
Cassandra got it right.

305
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,799
And Boo got it right.

306
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,425
Cassandra drew the strike first.

307
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,676
You're up.

308
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,011
>> Just random, anybody?

309
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,638
>> PROBST: It's not random.

310
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,140
Your reason, your choice.

311
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,517
You're giving somebody their

312
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,686
first blow in this game.

313
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,688
With force, Cassandra gives

314
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,440
Stacy her first knock.

315
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,026
Boo is not wasting any time.

316
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,612
Knocks out Stacy's second tower.

317
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,656
Yau-Man, you're up.

318
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:37,034
Just like that, Stacy is out of

319
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,619
this challenge.

320
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,787
Have a seat on the bench.

321
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,248
Next question-- who are you

322
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,624
least likely to invite to a

323
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,252
family dinner?

324
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:53,175
Everybody reveal.

325
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,011
Correct answer-- Boo.

326
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,178
>> Wow.

327
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,096
>> PROBST: Cassandra got it

328
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:57,972
right, Mookie got it right,

329
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:58,889
Dreamz got it right, and Alex

330
00:09:58,973 --> 00:09:59,974
got it right.

331
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,560
Mookie, you're up.

332
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,772
Will we have a repeat?

333
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,110
Will we have a second person

334
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,821
knocked out?

335
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,824
Boo is out of the challenge.

336
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:17,950
Once again Cassandra gets to

337
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,702
hit.

338
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,078
And knocks out Alex's first

339
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,247
tower.

340
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,790
Next question-- who most has a

341
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:29,211
sense of entitlement?

342
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,006
Everybody reveal.

343
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,966
The group felt Alex.

344
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:34,717
Cassandra got it right.

345
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,136
Mookie got it right.

346
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,722
Cassandra, you're up.

347
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,057
Cassandra going right back to

348
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,642
Alex.

349
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,686
Alex now down to his last tower.

350
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,773
Mookie smashes Earl's first

351
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,983
tower.

352
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,568
Next question-- who would you

353
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:53,736
most like to be stranded on an

354
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,821
island with?

355
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,698
Whose name came up the most

356
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,700
often?

357
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,119
Everybody reveal.

358
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,747
The correct answer is Yau-Man.

359
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,415
Everybody got it right except

360
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:06,832
Alex.

361
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,251
There is going to be some damage

362
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,128
done in this round.

363
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,673
Earl, you're up first.

364
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,424
Earl nonchalant.

365
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,301
Payback has begun.

366
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,303
Mookie back to Earl.

367
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,764
Dreamz heads to Alex.

368
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,350
Alex is out of this challenge.

369
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,560
Edgardo gives Earl a little

370
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,229
what's up and takes him out of

371
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:28,938
the challenge.

372
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,690
Yau-Man heads to Edgardo.

373
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,735
Cassandra knocks Mookie's

374
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,862
second tower out.

375
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,239
Okay, Earl and Alex are out of

376
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,490
the challenge.

377
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,032
Take a seat on the bench.

378
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,159
Who do you not want to see again

379
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,578
after the game?

380
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,457
Everybody reveal.

381
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,668
Everybody said Stacy.

382
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,754
Correct answer was Stacy.

383
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:57,508
Dreamz surveying the field.

384
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,386
Who's going to get his love?

385
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,804
Edgardo heading directly to

386
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,890
Yau-Man's towers.

387
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:08,811
Yau-Man getting even with

388
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,397
Dreamz.

389
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,648
Mookie going to pay Cassandra

390
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,108
back for her last hit.

391
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,402
Cassandra takes Mookie out of

392
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,778
the game.

393
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,448
Next question-- who smells the

394
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,866
worst?

395
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,034
Out of all the people left in

396
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:24,785
this game, who smells the worst?

397
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:28,372
Everybody reveal.

398
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,582
Edgardo thinks he smells the

399
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:29,874
worse.

400
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,126
Yau-Man thinks Stacy smells the

401
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,252
worst.

402
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,712
Cassandra and Dreamz think

403
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,630
Dreamz smells the worst.

404
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:37,006
Dreamz is nodding.

405
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:37,923
He knows.

406
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:38,924
It is Dreamz.

407
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:39,925
Cassandra got it right.

408
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,219
And Dreamz got it right.

409
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,013
Cassandra knocks Yau-Man out of

410
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,600
the game.

411
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,810
Just like that, Edgardo down to

412
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,562
his last tower.

413
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,147
Next question-- who mistakenly

414
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,232
believes they are in control of

415
00:12:55,316 --> 00:13:00,112
this game?

416
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,823
Everybody reveal.

417
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,450
The group felt Alex was the

418
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,868
person who mistakenly believed

419
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,036
they were in control of this

420
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,704
game.

421
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:09,997
Cassandra is right.

422
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,832
Make your move.

423
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,376
Edgardo's out of the game.

424
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:14,960
He takes a spot on the bench.

425
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,963
We are down to two.

426
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,049
Both have two towers left.

427
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,926
Who has wasted this great

428
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,887
opportunity?

429
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,015
Everybody reveal.

430
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:31,185
Correct answer is Stacy.

431
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,978
Cassandra got it right.

432
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,231
Make your move.

433
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,068
Cassandra knocks Dreamz's whole

434
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,569
name off the board.

435
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,029
>> Not so hard.

436
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,197
>> PROBST: Dreamz down to his

437
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,240
last tower.

438
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,783
Cassandra get this right, she

439
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,660
wins the challenge.

440
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,453
Athletically, who out here has

441
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,079
surprised you the most in terms

442
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,540
of their athleticism?

443
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,501
Reveal.

444
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,836
Dreamz says Cassandra.

445
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,381
Dreamz is wrong.

446
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,008
Cassandra says Yau-Man.

447
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,344
Cassandra is right.

448
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,971
>> Yeah!

449
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,181
>> PROBST: Take your last hit.

450
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,142
And with that, Cassandra wins

451
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,353
this challenge.

452
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,063
Not one question wrong.

453
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,523
Nice job.

454
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:18,148
First order of business will not

455
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,067
be fun.

456
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,235
You're sending one person to

457
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,444
Exile Island.

458
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,571
They will stay there until the

459
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,905
next immunity challenge.

460
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,324
Who are you going send off?

461
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,826
>> Mookie.

462
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,244
>> PROBST: Mookie, going back to

463
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,829
Exile Island.

464
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:32,371
The boat will pick you up.

465
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:35,541
Head on down to the water.

466
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,255
All right, next part of this

467
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,464
reward's a little more fun.

468
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,258
Here is your boarding pass to

469
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,092
your yacht.

470
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,052
>> Thank you.

471
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:47,678
>> PROBST: We'll pick you up at

472
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:48,012
camp.

473
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,847
You'll return to camp in the

474
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:50,764
morning, refreshed, some good

475
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:51,181
food in your belly.

476
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,225
Here are three more boarding

477
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,518
passes.

478
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,644
You are going to decide which

479
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,855
three people join you on this

480
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:58,981
reward, and you're going to do

481
00:14:59,064 --> 00:14:59,940
it when you get back to your

482
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,609
camp.

483
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:01,984
>> Okay.

484
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,944
>> I'll lick your feet, man.

485
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:04,528
>> PROBST: Some negotiating to

486
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,070
be had.

487
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,155
>> Uh-huh.

488
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:06,989
>> PROBST: All right, guys, grab

489
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,782
your stuff.

490
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,909
Head on back to camp.

491
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,509
>> I am very irritated with

492
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,677
Cassandra.

493
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,720
She just sent me to Exile

494
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,138
Island.

495
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,604
Cassandra is quiet, but in a

496
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:39,146
deceiving, conniving way.

497
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,147
She just made the worst mistake

498
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,901
of her life.

499
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:49,573
Given the clues, there has to be

500
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,032
two idols.

501
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,159
The Moto tribe members get the

502
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,285
same exact clues as the Ravu

503
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,203
members.

504
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,704
I mean, if you couldn't find

505
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,330
this on the third clue, you must

506
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,164
be stupid.

507
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,416
Worthless.

508
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,793
Earl came to Exile Island about

509
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:01,960
five, six times.

510
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:02,586
Most likely Earl found the other

511
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,213
one.

512
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,048
I'm 99% sure that Earl has the

513
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,758
immunity idol.

514
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,176
Smart guy.

515
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,804
All I want to do is take out

516
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,389
Cassandra and her alliance,

517
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,556
period.

518
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,432
Call it revenge, but I'm gunning

519
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,350
for her.

520
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,267
I just have to get in touch with

521
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,227
the Four Horsemen, and it's

522
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,813
done.

523
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:25,818
>> Cassandra back in high

524
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:26,568
school.

525
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,319
The most popular girl

526
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,153
again.

527
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,447
>> I just won my first reward,

528
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,865
first time on a yacht, and I had

529
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,575
a chance to take three people.

530
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,661
Dreamz you may as well come up.

531
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,164
>> What number?

532
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,375
>> Boo, come on up.

533
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,626
>> Oh, yes!

534
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,420
>> Basically my strategy was to

535
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,879
choose people that I needed to

536
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,214
form an alliance with.

537
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,632
Dreamz and Boo, I wasn't sure

538
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,133
where they stood.

539
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,259
Of course, it just gets tougher

540
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:53,429
as I narrow it down.

541
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,138
Oh, god.

542
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,097
This is hard.

543
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,266
Wow.

544
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,642
I mean, Yau-Man, would you join

545
00:16:58,726 --> 00:16:59,727
me?

546
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,060
>> Thank you.

547
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,813
>> And then the last one was

548
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:03,814
Yau-Man.

549
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:04,982
I just think Yau-Man works so

550
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,359
hard, and he needed a break.

551
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,110
>> De plane!

552
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,153
>> Hey, let's go, y'all.

553
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,237
They're honking for us.

554
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,072
>> De plane!

555
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,408
De plane!

556
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,875
>> Oh, yeah!

557
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:23,292
>> Welcome on board.

558
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,627
>> Well, thank you very much.

559
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,754
The first thing I saw on the

560
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,048
yacht was cheese and crackers

561
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,758
and olives, just an amazing

562
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:31,925
spread.

563
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,177
That's when it really started

564
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,803
hitting me-- I just won.

565
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,306
Boo, you want a margarita?

566
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,599
>> Yeah, I want a margarita!

567
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,683
>> I felt like "Welcome to the

568
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,726
lifestyle of the rich and

569
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,352
famous."

570
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,897
>> Champagne for you two.

571
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,024
I'll pass them over.

572
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,442
>> Cling-cling, cling-cling.

573
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,444
>> Boo, you're solidly with us.

574
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,904
>> Man, I am solidly...

575
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:55,282
>> Part of our syndicate.

576
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:58,160
And, Dreamz, the syndicate.

577
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,496
>> From day one.

578
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,330
>> Let's not make any more

579
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,415
mistakes.

580
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,625
Let's proceed carefully.

581
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,001
We'll go all the way.

582
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:06,585
>> It was hardball yesterday.

583
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,879
I was like, "Ooh!"

584
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,172
>> There's a lot of work to be

585
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:10,714
done on Dreamz, a little bit

586
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,174
more, so we can be absolutely

587
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,176
sure we have him on our side.

588
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,135
And this is a way for to us to

589
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,346
solidify it-- feed him, get him

590
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,223
away from everybody.

591
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,434
Just brainwash him, basically.

592
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,690
Cheers.

593
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,691
>> Cheers.

594
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,818
>> So we're all straight with

595
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,653
our alliance?

596
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:33,779
>> Uh-huh.

597
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,239
Without a doubt.

598
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,616
>> The next one to go is Alex.

599
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,034
>> Uh-huh.

600
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:39,701
He's playing a Harvard graduate

601
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,328
game.

602
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,247
He's playing hardball.

603
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,498
I think Dreamz is playing both

604
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,874
sides right now, because I can't

605
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,543
sense in his eyes 100%

606
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,252
commitment to our alliance, so I

607
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,170
don't know what the future is

608
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,297
going to be for us with Dreamz.

609
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,346
>> Firecrackers, Joe.

610
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,640
>> I'm the swing vote that's

611
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,101
stuck between the two alliances.

612
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:04,726
Mookie' plan was to stick with

613
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,979
the old plan and go with the

614
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,522
four boys and Stacy.

615
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,773
But my heart telling me go with

616
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,359
Cassandra, Earl, and Yau-Man and

617
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,611
Boo.

618
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,238
So it's like, so much

619
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,906
information going on that it's

620
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,907
clogging my mind, and I don't

621
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:19,825
know what to do right now.

622
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:20,826
It's like I'm being tugged in

623
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,286
every direction except my own.

624
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,052
>> Alex, man, they're going to

625
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:39,928
use your name.

626
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:40,846
They'll probably put your name

627
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,974
in the pot tomorrow.

628
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:44,892
Your name is going to come up

629
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,310
tomorrow.

630
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,313
Man, we messed up.

631
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,189
>> That's the thing.

632
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:51,607
What about Mookie?

633
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,441
If Mookie don't give you the

634
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,986
idol...

635
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:56,612
You haven't seen<i> Lord of the</i>

636
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,572
<i>Rings?"</i>

637
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,324
When they get the ring, like,

638
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,325
"My precious..."

639
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,285
>> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

640
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,536
Gollum.

641
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,787
>> Yeah.

642
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,788
He's getting like that.

643
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:07,623
>> I understand.

644
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,332
But I don't want to get knocked

645
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,333
out.

646
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:09,958
>> Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

647
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:10,459
That's what I'm saying.

648
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,127
I don't want you to get knocked

649
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,128
out.

650
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:14,296
>> Can we get the pot?

651
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,464
We need the pot.

652
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,715
>> Oh, you guys need the pot?

653
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:17,466
>> You guys are gone forever,

654
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,344
and we don't have that much

655
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,720
wood.

656
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:22,888
There is a major part of me that

657
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:23,388
wants to let Dreamz go.

658
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,473
You know, right now I'm trying

659
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,768
to keep it personal between us,

660
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,187
but if you keep on fraternizing

661
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,688
with the people that, you know,

662
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:32,814
we're talking about getting rid

663
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:33,857
of, then, you know, you're going

664
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,317
to have to get cut.

665
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,735
>> Who's going?

666
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:37,903
>> You know...

667
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:38,820
>> No, just say it.

668
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:39,780
>> Earl, I mean, he was... he's

669
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:40,989
not doubting you.

670
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,366
>> It hurt my feelings when you

671
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,367
just said that.

672
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,534
>> No.

673
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,702
>> Come here, Earl.

674
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:46,578
>> No, let me talk to you.

675
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,955
>> Let me talk to you.

676
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,289
Cassandra told me that you're...

677
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,458
>> I said we're not sure what

678
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,668
camp you're in and we need to

679
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,710
know that you're firm on our

680
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,795
side.

681
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:55,837
>> You know I heard what y'all

682
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,630
were saying, right?

683
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,839
You know I was standing there.

684
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,924
>> Yeah, yeah.

685
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,800
That's the whole thing.

686
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:00,676
What did we say?

687
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,302
Earl, I can tell by the way

688
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,221
you're looking at me that you're

689
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,138
doubting me.

690
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,056
>> This is one thing you need to

691
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:06,932
start doing a little bit more.

692
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:07,641
>> You don't see the show

693
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:08,475
enough.

694
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,101
You don't see the show enough to

695
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:09,685
strategize, because I can tell

696
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,103
you ain't strategizing.

697
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,270
>> I'm someone you need to

698
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,146
listen to more, because I notice

699
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,272
that you talk over us.

700
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:14,856
Now, we have agreed on this.

701
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,440
>> Mookie's got the immunity

702
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,401
idol.

703
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,778
Yes, Mookie has found the

704
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,113
immunity idol.

705
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:21,571
Mookie's got the idol.

706
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,489
>> He told you he had it?

707
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,658
>> I seen the idol.

708
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:25,659
>> What did it look like?

709
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,743
>> It's a turtle.

710
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:27,703
>> It's a turtle?

711
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,662
>> It's a little turtle

712
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:29,955
necklace.

713
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,915
>> A turtle necklace?

714
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,208
>> Yeah.

715
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:33,667
>> So he has the idol?

716
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,419
>> He has the idol.

717
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,005
>> Mm-hmm.

718
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,256
>> Why are you just now telling

719
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:39,756
me this about this idol?

720
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,717
I didn't even know anybody had

721
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,843
it from over there.

722
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:43,468
I should have been knowing that.

723
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:47,222
>> Mookie's got it.

724
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:48,724
>> Dreamz, his problem is he's

725
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,058
trying to do a lot of strategy

726
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,476
on his own, and, yes, it can be

727
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,853
effective, but if you don't tell

728
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:55,063
people what you're doing, I'm

729
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,064
sorry, I'm just not going to

730
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,441
trust anybody, especially

731
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,985
someone that, you know, has all

732
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,278
these little antics and things

733
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,446
about them that, you know, I

734
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,488
still kind of question anyway.

735
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,489
>> Homebody keep asking Mookie

736
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,490
about the idol.

737
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,408
>> He told everybody he has the

738
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:06,575
idol?

739
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,910
>> Yeah, him and Alex got the

740
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,037
idol.

741
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,912
>> They found it together?

742
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:11,788
>> Yes.

743
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:12,664
>> They didn't fight over it?

744
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,082
>> No.

745
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,709
>> There are two hidden immunity

746
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:16,501
idols.

747
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,378
The one over here in the Moto

748
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,547
camp was dug up by me.

749
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,134
Dreamz revealed that Mookie

750
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,719
actually have the immunity idol

751
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,846
from Ravu island.

752
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,139
The fact that Mookie have it

753
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,849
made me very nervous, and not

754
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,184
only that, the other two crucial

755
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,061
members, Edgardo and Alex, also

756
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:34,519
know he has it.

757
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,813
I have to rethink how this will

758
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,066
play out.

759
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,695
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

760
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:51,953
We'll now bring in Mookie,

761
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,372
returning from Exile Island.

762
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:58,752
You guys ready to get to today's

763
00:22:58,835 --> 00:22:59,586
challenge?

764
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:00,420
>> Yep.

765
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,004
>> PROBST: First things first.

766
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,507
Give it up.

767
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:08,762
Tribal immunity is no more.

768
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,889
Individual immunity is what you

769
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:11,640
covet.

770
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,600
You have this around your neck,

771
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:14,643
you cannot be voted out.

772
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,978
Shall we get to the challenge?

773
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,396
>> Yeah.

774
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:18,647
>> Yeah.

775
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,607
>> PROBST: For today's challenge

776
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:24,152
you are going to use your arms

777
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,445
to brace between two walls while

778
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,613
your feet are positioned on very

779
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:29,324
narrow footholds.

780
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,867
Every 30 minutes, you'll step

781
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:31,493
down to an even smaller

782
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,829
foothold, making it more

783
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:34,955
difficult.

784
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,164
When you reach the third and

785
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,290
final foothold, you will stay

786
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,417
there for as long as you can.

787
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,001
When you fall off, you're out.

788
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,420
Big rules-- no hips, no back, no

789
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,630
butt.

790
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,340
Arms and feet only.

791
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:46,550
Last person left standing wins

792
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,551
immunity.

793
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,718
Losers go to tribal council.

794
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:49,845
Somebody will be going home.

795
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:50,846
Take your spots.

796
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,640
We'll get started.

797
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,730
This challenge is officially

798
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,649
underway.

799
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,672
Day 27, another hot one.

800
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:29,509
Not a bit of breeze out here.

801
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,436
Edgardo looks like he could go

802
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:39,686
all day.

803
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,897
Mookie looks like he might be

804
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,983
asleep he's so comfortable.

805
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:48,570
>> Ouch!

806
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,488
>> PROBST: Cassandra steps down.

807
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:51,448
She's the first person out of

808
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,449
the challenge.

809
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:53,700
Take a spot on the bench.

810
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:09,841
(<i> drumming</i> )

811
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,801
>> Meke!

812
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,429
Voodoo.

813
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:20,936
>> Oh, man!

814
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:21,603
>> PROBST: Out of nowhere,

815
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,064
Edgardo slips off.

816
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,107
And then there were seven.

817
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:26,733
The foothold you're standing on

818
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,027
now, less than an inch wide.

819
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,445
By the time you get to the

820
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:31,821
bottom, less than a quarter

821
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,699
inch.

822
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:35,992
Okay, you've been up there 30

823
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:36,660
minutes.

824
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:38,954
It is time to move down one

825
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:39,746
foothold.

826
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:43,041
Everybody move.

827
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,793
You are now sitting on a

828
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,002
foothold less than a half an

829
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,629
inch wide.

830
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:48,672
Mookie looks like a fixed piece

831
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:52,217
of art.

832
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,510
Mookie slips off, but recovers.

833
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:56,012
Earl...

834
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,472
>> Slipped.

835
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:57,973
>> PROBST: ...slipped.

836
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:58,598
Earl is the third person out of

837
00:25:58,682 --> 00:25:59,808
this challenge.

838
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,768
Who is the odds-on favorite now,

839
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,229
Earl?

840
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:08,733
>> Stacy.

841
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:09,192
>> PROBST: Cassandra?

842
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:09,776
>> Stacy.

843
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:10,652
>> PROBST: Edgardo?

844
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:11,611
>> What I would say right now by

845
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,823
looking at everybody, Stacy.

846
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:21,037
>> PROBST: Mookie the fourth

847
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:24,374
person out of this challenge.

848
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,089
Five of you have lasted one

849
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,340
hour.

850
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,258
Everybody step down.

851
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:34,259
You'll be standing on less than

852
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:37,178
a quarter inch of wood.

853
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,851
Dreamz struggling.

854
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:46,521
Alex drops out.

855
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:48,815
We are now down to Boo, Dreamz,

856
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,817
Stacy, and Yau Man.

857
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,404
Dreamz is out of the challenge.

858
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,156
And we are now down to three

859
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,782
people left.

860
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,759
>> PROBST: After an hour and 15

861
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,010
minutes, Stacy is out of the

862
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:21,348
challenge.

863
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,349
>> Ooh-wee!

864
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,558
>> PROBST: Boo with a very nice

865
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,602
recovery.

866
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:26,728
Boo almost loses it, and saves

867
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,356
himself again.

868
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,523
>> How many lives does that guy

869
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,525
have?

870
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,860
>> PROBST: Boo slipping again

871
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,780
and hanging in there.

872
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,283
Boo struggling to recover.

873
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,702
>> Oh!

874
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,037
>> PROBST: Yau-Man wins first

875
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,746
individual immunity.

876
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:45,705
>> I'm sure I could stay another

877
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,832
hour.

878
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,084
>> PROBST: Yau-Man, come on

879
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,086
over.

880
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,256
Congratulations.

881
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,216
Yau-Man, safe tonight at the

882
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,175
vote.

883
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,551
One of you is going home

884
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:58,760
tonight.

885
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,678
Grab your stuff, head back to

886
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:01,930
camp.

887
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,030
>> All right, it will bring good

888
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,658
luck to everybody.

889
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:26,996
>> By Cassandra sending me to

890
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,081
Exile Island she ruined the game

891
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,082
for herself and her alliance.

892
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:29,833
I am going to take out her whole

893
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:33,378
alliance one by one.

894
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:39,968
Knowing that Earl potentially

895
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:40,969
has the idol does change the

896
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,346
game a little bit in terms of

897
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,472
strategy.

898
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,473
You want to get the guy with the

899
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,558
immunity idol, and get him by

900
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,143
surprise.

901
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,310
And hopefully we can take him

902
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,270
out, and take him out with the

903
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,229
immunity idol, and he won't use

904
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,605
it.

905
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,231
>> Hey, look-- I trust you guys.

906
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:53,898
You're my best bet.

907
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:57,402
>> When I was on Exile Island I

908
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:58,736
committed myself to that.

909
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,654
I'm like, "I will not be

910
00:28:59,737 --> 00:29:00,530
faltered.

911
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:01,531
I will not be wavered by

912
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:02,615
anybody."

913
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:03,533
This is the order that we're

914
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,659
sticking with-- Earl, Yau Man,

915
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:05,743
Boo.

916
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:06,578
It's done.

917
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:07,412
>> It's done.

918
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:08,246
>> It's done.

919
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,164
>> Are you 100% on Stacy?

920
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:09,914
>> Stacy is with us.

921
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:10,832
She's with us.

922
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,377
>> Are you sure?

923
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:20,216
>> It's so weird.

924
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,050
We're going go to tribal

925
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:21,926
council, and I have no idea

926
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:22,927
what's going on.

927
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,221
I have no idea.

928
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,859
>> But it makes no point if I'm

929
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,027
the only person that's voting

930
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,321
for Alex.

931
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:42,822
Okay, as long as I have that

932
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:47,785
assurance.

933
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:48,411
Then I'll do that to save myself

934
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,038
then.

935
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,553
Are you in?

936
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:14,812
>> I, of course, want to go with

937
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:15,813
the majority.

938
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:16,397
So it's who do I trust more at

939
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,399
this point in the game?

940
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,776
I don't owe anything to Alex.

941
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,110
If saving myself means severing

942
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,404
a tie, then I'll sever that tie.

943
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:31,913
>> That means she's not in,

944
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,082
dude.

945
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,376
No.

946
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,050
>> What do you think?

947
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,009
I think not.

948
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,052
>> I think... I don't know.

949
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,304
I think not.

950
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,182
>> Pretty much.

951
00:30:56,854 --> 00:30:57,772
>> You think Mookie is going to

952
00:30:57,855 --> 00:31:00,233
do that?

953
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,318
>> That's the thing.

954
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,612
If Stacy comes through today...

955
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:11,160
>> Os to show the immunity idol.

956
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,830
>> Show the immunity idol.

957
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,081
All right, well, have that in

958
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,249
line, and have that thing ready

959
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,876
just in case.

960
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,048
>> My hope was that Stacy would

961
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,383
vote with us today to make it

962
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:26,676
5-3, but it seems like she's not

963
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,011
voting with us anymore.

964
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,929
I don't want to use the immunity

965
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,724
idol this early in the game.

966
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,267
But at the same time, I have to

967
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,602
strategically think about what's

968
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:36,519
going to get me the furthest in

969
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,020
this game.

970
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,230
I can save Alex by giving him

971
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,523
the immunity idol, but this

972
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,858
early in the game to use the

973
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,026
immunity idol is kind of a

974
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,193
disadvantage.

975
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,320
So things have gotten very

976
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:49,032
complicated.

977
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,242
>> Mook, Mook, Mook, Mook.

978
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,805
>> Turns out that Mookie gave

979
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,556
the idol to Alex, so we're going

980
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,225
to vote Mookie just to catch

981
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,602
them off guard.

982
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,120
>> Dreamz, Alex, Mookie and I

983
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,705
are voting for Cassandra.

984
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:19,664
I think that's the smartest

985
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:20,665
move.

986
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:21,499
And also, it will be like... you

987
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,458
know, have the hardest punch at

988
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,376
tribal council.

989
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,503
This is an all-or-nothing move.

990
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:26,921
But if it works out, it will

991
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:27,797
probably be one of the best

992
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,966
moves ever.

993
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,323
>> I think we should talk about

994
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,241
it between the five of us.

995
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:56,075
Look, we should do... look, we

996
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,076
should do the five of us for

997
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,745
Edgardo, and not say anything to

998
00:33:58,828 --> 00:33:59,954
anybody else.

999
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:01,330
That's it.

1000
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,256
>> What's going on now is total

1001
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,174
chaos.

1002
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,634
A lot of people are paranoid.

1003
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:14,761
The panic button has been

1004
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,221
pushed.

1005
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,390
Mookie had the idol.

1006
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,517
He actually gave it to Alex.

1007
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,226
So that was from our source,

1008
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,188
which is Dreamz, but it could be

1009
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,189
a test.

1010
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:28,441
It doesn't matter, because we're

1011
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,859
smarter than that, so we won't

1012
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,402
vote Alex or Mookie.

1013
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,779
We're going to vote Edgardo.

1014
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,615
>> Alex, Alex.

1015
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,007
>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

1016
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,260
the members of our jury.

1017
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:41,764
Rocky, Lisi, and Michelle, voted

1018
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,349
out at the last tribal council.

1019
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,398
Okay, Dreamz, was there a mad

1020
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,400
scramble when you got back after

1021
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,026
the challenge today?

1022
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,444
>> Jeff, if you was on that

1023
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,946
beach, it was chaotic.

1024
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,239
The most chaotic day of any

1025
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:01,409
time-- swing pitchers, swing

1026
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,243
voters, swing hitters.

1027
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,327
And I'm talking on behalf of

1028
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,328
everybody.

1029
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,413
It's the most chaotic day ever.

1030
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,540
>> I mean, seriously, right now,

1031
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:08,624
I don't even know who the

1032
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,084
majority is.

1033
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:11,085
I'm lost.

1034
00:36:11,168 --> 00:36:11,502
I'm, like, paranoid.

1035
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,253
I've been paranoid ever since...

1036
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,630
I mean, I'm paranoid right now.

1037
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:15,882
>> PROBST: Yau-Man, the one

1038
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,425
guy who doesn't have to be

1039
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,552
paranoid tonight is you.

1040
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,304
>> This is the first time I've

1041
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,639
come to a tribal council meeting

1042
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:24,265
with a regular heart rate and

1043
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,851
normal blood pressure.

1044
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,477
And that's a good thing for an

1045
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,229
old man.

1046
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,356
>> PROBST: Mookie, so you're

1047
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,941
gone two days, and you come back

1048
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:34,483
to the most chaotic day out

1049
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,028
here.

1050
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,446
>> Like Edgardo said, tons of

1051
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,781
different names coming up.

1052
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:41,699
I'm thinking I'm one of the

1053
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:44,660
people, since I was at Exile.

1054
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:45,578
I don't know what's going on,

1055
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:46,454
either.

1056
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,371
But I guess I have to use my own

1057
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,289
judgment.

1058
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:48,956
>> PROBST: Yau-Man, the way the

1059
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,498
idol plays this season is a

1060
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,291
little different.

1061
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,960
How does that impact how you

1062
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,086
vote?

1063
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,213
>> If we suspect someone has the

1064
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,132
idol, we should try to avoid

1065
00:36:58,215 --> 00:37:00,635
voting for that person and vote

1066
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,136
somebody in his alliance out

1067
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:02,428
first.

1068
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,472
There's two ways to defeat an

1069
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,848
army.

1070
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:06,933
One is to cut off the head.

1071
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:07,934
The other is to take away all

1072
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,852
the soldiers.

1073
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,854
>> PROBST: Alex, how much time

1074
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,105
do you spend thinking about the

1075
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,691
idol in terms of your strategy?

1076
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,401
>> Logically speaking, I'm going

1077
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,070
to suspect that the people who

1078
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:19,695
have been to Exile Island, like

1079
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,739
Earl, are probably going to have

1080
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,074
it.

1081
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:23,658
So that tells me either avoid

1082
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,369
Earl or try to take out people

1083
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:29,497
in an Earl's alliance.

1084
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,915
>> PROBST: Dreamz, how crazy is

1085
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,124
this vote going to be tonight?

1086
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,209
>> This vote right here is going

1087
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:33,834
to determine everything in the

1088
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,544
game.

1089
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,213
It's going to separate the

1090
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,839
snakes and rats right here.

1091
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:39,924
>> PROBST: All right, let's get

1092
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,008
to the vote.

1093
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,218
First thing, if somebody has the

1094
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:42,802
hidden immunity idol and you

1095
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,387
want to play it, you would

1096
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,055
present it to me after we voted,

1097
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,640
but before I read the votes.

1098
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:48,349
Yau-Man, you have individual

1099
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,601
immunity.

1100
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:51,644
You can, of course, give that to

1101
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:52,812
somebody if you want to, or you

1102
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,397
can hang on to it.

1103
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,690
>> I'll hang on to it for

1104
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,816
tonight.

1105
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:57,817
>> PROBST: Yau-Man is safe.

1106
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,651
You cannot vote for Yau-Man

1107
00:37:58,734 --> 00:37:59,610
tonight.

1108
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,070
Everybody else is fair game.

1109
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,071
It's time to vote.

1110
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,240
Alex, you're up.

1111
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:15,960
>> A strategic move.

1112
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,545
Let's still be friends.

1113
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,681
>> Nothing against you, but

1114
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:29,598
better you than me.

1115
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,143
Let's see if this works.

1116
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,453
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1117
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:53,873
votes.

1118
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:05,801
Okay, if anybody has the hidden

1119
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:06,552
immunity idol and you want to

1120
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:07,595
play it, now is the time to do

1121
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,848
so.

1122
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,660
Alex is playing the hidden

1123
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,079
immunity idol.

1124
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:33,662
Alex is immune from tonight's

1125
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,414
vote.

1126
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,582
All votes cast for Alex do not

1127
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,793
count.

1128
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,544
I'll read the votes.

1129
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:49,720
First vote, Cassandra.

1130
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,098
Cassandra.

1131
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,224
Cassandra.

1132
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,434
Two votes Cassandra.

1133
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,688
That's three votes Cassandra.

1134
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:08,447
Mookie.

1135
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,158
One vote Mookie.

1136
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,621
Edgardo.

1137
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:17,832
That's three votes Cassandra,

1138
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:18,874
one vote Mookie, one vote

1139
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,585
Edgardo.

1140
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,549
Edgardo.

1141
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,883
That's three votes Cassandra,

1142
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,218
two votes Edgardo, one vote

1143
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:32,638
Mookie.

1144
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,932
Edgardo.

1145
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,016
We are tied.

1146
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:36,600
Three votes Cassandra, three

1147
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,854
votes Edgardo, one vote Mookie.

1148
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,860
Edgardo.

1149
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,194
That's four votes Edgardo, three

1150
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,487
votes Cassandra, one vote

1151
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:49,989
Mookie.

1152
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:52,241
One vote left.

1153
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:56,871
Tenth person voted out and the

1154
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,956
fourth member of our jury,

1155
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,291
Edgardo.

1156
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,376
You need to bring me your torch.

1157
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,846
Edgardo, the tribe has spoken.

1158
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,819
Well, Alex played the hidden

1159
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,029
immunity idol tonight.

1160
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,738
Turns out he didn't need it.

1161
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,157
The idol will be rehidden.

1162
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:33,741
New clues will be put out on

1163
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,826
Exile Island.

1164
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,535
The chaos of tonight's tribal

1165
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,914
council is a great reminder that

1166
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,500
this game is always in a state

1167
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,918
of flux-- something to keep in

1168
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:44,877
the back of your head as you

1169
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,753
head into the home stretch of

1170
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:46,629
this game.

1171
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:47,546
Grab your torches, head back to

1172
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,256
camp, good night.

1173
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:03,187
>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes

1174
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:03,812
from our next episode.

1175
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,150
>> PROBST: Next time on

1176
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,026
<i>Survivor...</i>

1177
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:09,818
Dreamz has some explaining to

1178
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:10,653
do.

1179
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:11,570
>> Dude, you turned on us.

1180
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:12,196
>> No, I didn't turn on you all.

1181
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:12,780
>> How do you figure?

1182
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,865
>> PROBST: Alex and Mookie

1183
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,367
discover that Yau-Man has the

1184
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,702
other hidden immunity idol.

1185
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:19,703
>> He has it.

1186
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:20,704
>> PROBST: And a new plan is

1187
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:21,914
born.

1188
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,499
>> It's going to feel so great.

1189
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:24,833
That's going to feel so...

1190
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,258
>> I'm a little bit disappointed

1191
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,342
that Dreamz messed me up in that

1192
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,677
vote.

1193
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,011
My plan was an all or nothing,

1194
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,304
and it didn't work out.

1195
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,472
But I tried my best, and to the

1196
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,640
guys that voted me off, best of

1197
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,642
luck.

1198
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:42,685
There's a couple of people that

1199
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:43,811
don't deserve the million

1200
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,020
dollars, but there are a couple

1201
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,021
that do, and Cassandra,

1202
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:46,814
hopefully you will get voted off

1203
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:47,982
next because I don't like you

1204
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,567
very much.
