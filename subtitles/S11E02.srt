00:00:03,878 --> 00:00:05,088
In the jungles of Guatemala,

4
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,589
among the ruins of an

5
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,341
ancient civilization, 16

6
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:09,759
Americans began their

00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,636
adventure with a big surprise.

8
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,179
Come on out.

9
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,556
I'm sure you guys recognize

10
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,765
Bobby Jon and Stephenie from

11
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,434
Survivor Palau.

12
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:21,187
Stephenie is a member of Yaxha.

13
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,857
Bobby Jon is a member of Nakum.

14
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,150
>> We were just thrilled to have

15
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,568
Bobby Jon because he's not going

16
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:28,153
to quit for anything.

17
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,947
I was like, oh, we're winning.

18
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,032
We got Stephenie, like,

19
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,367
we're good to go.

sure.

25
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,374
faced off in their first

reward challenge.

27
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,711
It's a grueling 11-mile race

28
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,880
through the jungles of

29
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,548
Guatemala.

30
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:49,758
The winning tribe claims the

31
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:50,925
right to the better camp;

32
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,177
they also get flint to make

33
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,595
fire.

you go.

>> On Stephenie's Yaxha tribe,

40
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:02,812
Gary kept his true identity

41
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:03,396
a secret.

42
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,942
>> Gary, what do you do?

43
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:08,276
>> All right!

44
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,653
I was in the NFL for 11 years.

45
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,279
My real name is Gary Hogeboom.

46
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,907
If somebody does recognize me,

47
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,283
Just gonna say that's not me.

48
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,201
I'm Gary Hawkins.

49

>> JEFF: And Bobby Jon's Nakum

50
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,455
tribe faced a setback when Blake

51
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,873
got hurt.

that have briars that

54
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,668
look like spikes actually broke

55
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,420
on Blake's shoulder.

56
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,047
That really took him down a

57
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,007
couple notches.

58
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,133
>> JEFF: After a grueling night

59
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,218
in the jungle...

60
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,260
>> Guys, wait, wait, wait,

61
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,428
please.

62
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,554
JEFF: The tribes stayed close.

64
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,224
behind us.

65
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,767
>> We need to, like, get right

66
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,894
on their ass, if not pass them.

67

>> JEFF: With Yaxha on their

68
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:44,687
heels, Bobby Jon's Nakum tribe

69
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,189
narrowly pulled it off.

70
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,191
>> Oh, yeah!

71
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,526
>> JEFF: Congratulations.

72
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,277
The losing Yaxha was sent out to

73
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,487
find their camp.

74
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,822
You've got more paddling to do.

75
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,281
Even though they had no flint

76
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,242
to make fire, Yaxha made the

77
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,827
best of their situation.

78
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,829
>> I am so psyched.

79
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,205
Finally, I'm on a tribe that's

80
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,665
got as much heart and

81
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:04,290
determination as me.

82
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,376
>> JEFF: Back at Nakum, the

83
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,794
victory had come at a high

84
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:08,253
price.

Breathe through your nose,

88
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,383
Blake.

89
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,551
>> Bobby Jon?

90
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,593
>> Huh?

91
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,928
His eyes are rolling back

92
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:17,512
>> We have these big strong

93
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,055
guys, strong as oxes, and

94
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:19,722
they're all down.

challenge, the Yaxha spirit

97
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,310
secured them a victory...

98
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,187
Yaxha wins immunity!

Though Blake, Judd and Bobby Jon

102
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,529
were physically ailing,

103
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,948
Jim was the worst off and was

104
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,867
voted out of the tribe.

105
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,952
>> Jim, the tribe has spoken.

106
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,247
17 are left.

107
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,333
Who will be voted out tonight?

108
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:00,490
>> A rock, a rock.

109
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,117
Watch, watch, watch.

110
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,994
Has anybody found the trail yet?

111
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,496
>> This is a place where you

112
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,497
could break your leg,

113
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,499
your ankle.

114
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,875
>> Tonight we had Tribal

115
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:11,417
Council, and it seems like

116
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,294
that's where I live.

117
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,295
It seems like I'm paying rent at

118
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,421
Tribal Council.

119
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:19,092
I'm waiting for it to change.

120
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,134
>> You know what.

121
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,803
Just go lay down, okay?

122
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:24,055
>> (<i> coughing</i> )

123
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,890
>> We just don't have the energy

124
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:29,811
to suffer the emotional hit--

125
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,604
the physical hit is bad enough.

126
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,355
The emotional toll that Tribal

127
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,774
Council takes on you is

128
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,317
terrible.

129
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,778
It's just a sick, sick feeling

130
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,114
knowing we had to go and even

131
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,491
worse coming back.

132
00:04:43,574 --> 00:05:07,974
(<i> coughing</i> )

133
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,183
>> They just don't look like

134
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,143
they're having fun.

135
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,478
>> They are so serious and they

136
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,855
are not like buddy-buddy,

137
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,273
you know?

138
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,274
>> I'm telling you, it's Bobby

139
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:16,441
Jon.

140
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,692
He's so damn serious.

141
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:18,484
>> It's day four and we're

142
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,987
getting to know each other

143
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,696
really well.

144
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,364
We all have different qualities.

145
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,490
We have an amazing tribe.

146
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,409
>> Better to be diverse like we

147
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,453
are.

148
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,872
>> We got the most diverse group

149
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,123
there.

150
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,791
We got a bum.

151
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,626
We got a police officer.

152
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,461
We got a magician's assistant.

153
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,589
We got a fish monger.

154
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,091
We got a gay guy and we got a

155
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,718
landscaper-- but we all come

156
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,845
together and it's brilliant.

157
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,055
>> Are you guys cold, or no?

158
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,264
>> No, but a tarantula jumped on

159
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:48,598
my arm.

160
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,600
>> A tarantula?

161
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,517
How big?

162
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,518
>> About that big.

163
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,437
>> You saw a tarantula?

164
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,063
>> GARY: You know, they've asked

165
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:55,688
me what I do, and I told them I

166
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,106
was a landscaper, not a

167
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,316
quarterback.

168
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,358
Nobody has asked me what I did

169
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,486
15 years ago, so I guess I don't

170
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,571
have to tell them.

171
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,201
>> All right.

172
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,911
Head back.

173
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:12,455
>> Want one or two?

174
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,623
>> You braiding hair?

175
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,916
>> I want to French braid yours.

176
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:15,500
I want to learn how to do it.

177
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,543
>> No?

178
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,795
>> You want to learn on my head?

179
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,337
Why you want to learn on my

180
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,255
head?

181
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,007
It's just like a fun camp life

182
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,425
It's much different from

183
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:24,967
anything I had experienced

184
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,636
before

185
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,513
So I think the fact that we get

186
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,098
along so well is huge,

187
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:30,640
Cause we do have good team

188
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,307
morale.

189
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,475
It's become like a family, and

190
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,602
we're hoping to keep that family

191
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,687
together for a long time.

192
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,861

>> Want me to read it?

194
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:45,863
>> Go ahead.

195
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,865
>> Yeah.

196
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,200
>> "Hunger is a burden.

197
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,451
You need energy to compete.

198
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,994
You've been caught in a web of

199
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:52,537
hardship.

200
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,454
Winning this one will help you

201
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,456

202
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,500
>> We just got tree mail, and

203
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,210
that's the last thing I wanted

204
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,586
to hear.

205
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,380
For some reason I just can't

206
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,923
breathe, and I've been

207
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,633
struggling for the last

208
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,135
three or four days.

209
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:07,718
I haven't slept and so forth,

210
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,512
and drinking water doesn't seem

211
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,597
to help.

212
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,935
>> Blake...

213
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:16,269
Lay down, hon.

214
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:16,894
Lay down if you feel short of

215
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,020
breath.

216
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,022
>> I can't breathe.

217
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:20,648
>> I'm really, really worried

218
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,608
about Blake.

219
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,319
He's a strong, you know,

220
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,571
young guy.

221
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,155
He's heaving.

222
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,698
He's struggling to get breaths

223
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,700
and something's not right.

224
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:34,245
>> (<i> gasping</i> )

225
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,788
>> Breathe through your nose.

226
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,206
Breathe through your nose.

227
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:37,665
>> Oh, God.

228
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,668
>> We got you-- okay.

229
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,753
>> It's okay.

230
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,506
>> Blake, like, he is-- I don't

231
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,883
think he can really handle it

232
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,343
out here, because he's just, you

233
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,845
know, on his hands and knees and

234
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,097
just breathing hard and has been

235
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:53,723
having problems the whole time

236
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,475
we've been out here.

237
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,270
>> Blake, are you going to be

238
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,856
able to do it?

239
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:02,648
>> I ain't got anything against

240
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,900
the guy.

241
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,443
I think he's a good guy and

242
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,986
everything, but I'm more one of

243
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,613
those, like a tougher guy which,

244
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,198
you know, you're hurting and

245
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,782
everything, but you've just got

246
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,868
to man up.

247
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,921
>> JEFF: Come on in, guys.

248
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,805
Yaxha getting your first look at

249
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,266
the new Nakum.

250
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,808
Jim, voted out at the first

251
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,561
Tribal Council.

252
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,855
All right.

253
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:43,981
You guys ready to get to today's

254
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:44,899
challenge?

255
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,067
>> Yes.

256
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,109
>> JEFF: It is for reward.

257
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,361
Here's how it works.

258
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,570
On my go, you will race one at a

259
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,905
time up a ramp, across the net

260
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,907
run, out on to a rope spider

261
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,784
web.

262
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:55,785
Attached to the web are eight

263
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,246
bags.

264
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,164
Crawling underneath the web

265
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,832
you'll attempt to retrieve a

266
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,417
bag.

267
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:03,960
Once you have a bag, drop

268
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,711
yourself into the water, make

269
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:06,545
your way back.

270
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,964
If you fall into the water

271
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,548
without a bag, you've got to

272
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,675
come back to the start--

273
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:11,717
next person goes.

274
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,802
Everybody must attempt this

275
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,554
course at least once.

276
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,931
After that, you can go in any

277
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,891
order you want and send whoever

278
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,309
you want.

279
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,727
First tribe to retrieve all

280
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,521
eight bags wins reward.

281
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,146
Want to know what you're playing

282
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,314
for?

283
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,399
>> Yeah.

284
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:26,899
>> JEFF: Fishing items.

285
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,651
>> Wow.

286
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,944
>> JEFF: Worms.

287
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:30,152
>> Yeah!

288
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,655
>> JEFF: Filet knife.

289
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:36,534
Lots of hooks, corks, weights,

290
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,202
twine.

291
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:38,786
Because, in addition to the

292
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,788
crocs, there are lots of fish in

293
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,373
that lake.

294
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,499
Yaxha, you have one extra

295
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:44,500
member.

296
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:45,042
You're sitting somebody out.

297
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,877
Keeping mind you cannot sit

298
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,087
out the same person in back-to-

299
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,005
back challenges.

300
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:49,380
Who's sitting out?

301
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,673
Amy, You're going to sit this

302
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:51,048
one out?

303
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,925
>> Right.

304
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:53,718
>> Take your spots.

305
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:54,802
Wait for my go.

306
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,721
>> JEFF: All right, guys.

307
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:57,763
First two up at the red start.

308
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,142
Jamie and Bobby Jon.

309
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,102

315
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,736
>> There you go, Jamie, you got

316
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,571
it.

317
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:14,613
>> Go up the center.

318
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,031
Go up the center.

We're like, all right, we're

573
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:27,921
gonna get us a big fish.

574
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:31,717
>> That steady on...?

575
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,594
>> Nice!

576
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,763
>> Good job.

577
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,556
>> Today, we were just so ready

578
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,098
to get on the boat.

579
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,142
I wanted to get out there and

580
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:40,809
fish so bad.

581
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,102
I'm feeling better a little bit

582
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:42,686
right now.

583
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,646
I'm not panting as much.

584
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,023
Just as long as I'm competitive

585
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,649
and I can play like I did

586
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,193
yesterday, I'm good.

587
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,653
>> I got one, I got one.

588
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,157
>> Yes, yes!

589
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,242
>> Breakfast.

590
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:11,840
What do you think's in these

591
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,675
things?

592
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,843
>> Maybe we should have some

593
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:15,844
corn, what do you think?

594
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:16,303
>> Excellent.

595
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,513
I was going to suggest that.

596
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,681
It'd be such a treat.

597
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,183
>> Yaxha is in desperation food

598
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,185
mode right now.

599
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,187
Everything out here we will try,

600
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,563
at least once.

601
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,731
What is that?

602
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:28,690
Oh, wow!

603
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,399
Does anyone want to eat a

604
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:29,900
grasshopper?

605
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,360
>> No.

606
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,778
>> That's a grasshopper?

607
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:33,278
>> That's a grasshopper.

608
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:40,077
>> That's a huge grasshopper.

609
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,829
>> It's a busy morning.

610
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,580
Everybody is working, except for

611
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,248
right now, I would say Morgan is

612
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,708
the one that's not doing as much

613
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,876
around the camp as everybody

614
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,920
else.

615
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,004
I love Morgan, but you've got to

616
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:51,547
work around camp if you want

617
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,382
tribe mates to be on your side.

618
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,467
>> (<i> swishing water</i> )

619
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,604
>> I'm making a cove inlet, as

620
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,481
you can see.

621
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,483
It's pretty wide and a little

622
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,485
opening in the front there...

623
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,236
And after everything settles

624
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,905
I'll cover it up with a burlap

625
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:17,447
sack and I'll catch a little

626
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,032
protein.

627
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,035
We need some protein.

628
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,246
>> You want to eat ants?

629
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,206
>> I thought it was going to be

630
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,749
termites.

631
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,042
>> Yeah, I thought it was going

632
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:29,918
to be, too, but those are ants.

633
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,003
>> We need protein.

634
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:31,962
>> I'll eat ants.

635
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:32,588
Let's do it.

636
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,213
>> Okay, go.

637
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,340
>> I don't know.

638
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,217
>> Where did you get that nest

639
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,219
thing from?

640
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,471
>> Was there like millions?

641
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,764
>> I mean, we've probably got

642
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,267
like 200 ants here.

643
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,977
>> Rafe and Gary decided to go

644
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,437
get an ant nest because ants are

645
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,231
apparently full of protein,

646
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,566
which is so nasty.

647
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,567
>> What do you think?

648
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,569
I can't believe I'm eating ants

649
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,737
>> Ants can't bite, can they?

650
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,779
>> Yep.

651
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,280
>> Oh.

652
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,282
>> Mine almost had like a nice

653
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,201
little zing to them.

654
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,536
I'm not going to be eating ants

655
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,996
As long as I have corn and water

656
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:06,622
that's what I'll sustain myself

657
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:11,168
on until I win a food challenge.

658
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,086
>> You have any luck down there

659
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:13,545
with the burlap sack?

660
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,505
>> Ten little minnows.

661
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,090
>> You got ten minnows?

662
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,091
>> Little tiny guys, but it's

663
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,217
something.

664
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,344
>> That's a minnow each!

665
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,179
>> You are a work horse.

666
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,764
I think we need you.

667
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:24,765
>> What do you think, fish

668
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:25,891
monger, how long does a fish

669
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:26,308
like this go?

670
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,226
>> Fry it to a crisp.

671
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,810
>> We don't need those hooks

672
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,520
and lines.

673
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,647
>> Cheers, cheers.

674
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,356
>> Enjoy.

675
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:35,609
>> Oh! Mm-mm!

676
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,736
>> You know what they say, the

677
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,071
way to a man's heart is through

678
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,572
their stomachs.

679
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,658
Tastes like trout on a grill.

680
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:49,748
>> (<i> breathing deeply</i> )

(<i> belches</i> )

683
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:07,891
>> Let me tell you something

684
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,685
about Blake.

685
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,269
He does basically nothing in

686
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,353
camp.

687
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,521
I mean, the guy's a great guy,

688
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,563
but he does nothing in camp.

689
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:14,564
And then you got Margaret just

690
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,650
nurturing him all day.

691
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,281
>> Every time I turn around,

692
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,533
that's all I hear: Sit down

693
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,617
and relax.

694
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,827
Get some water.

695
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,452
Sit down, relax, get some water.

696
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:31,331
And I'm saying to myself, damn,

697
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,749
how much more relaxing does this

698
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,293
dude need, man?

699
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,212
The guy sleeps all day, man,

700
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:37,462
you know.

701
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,840
I'm getting screwed, man, me and

702
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,174
you bringing this damn water up

703
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,678
and going up there all...

704
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:45,470
lagged out, and arms can't even

705
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,724
move, man.

706
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,349
>> No, you're right.

707
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,559
>> I'm not going to be pulling

708
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,978
his weight all day.

709
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,312
Blake just rests all day,

710
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:54,896
man, it's just like a big rest

711
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,815
for him.

712
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,233
So he's got all of his strength

713
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:58,859
and his energy to go into these

714
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,652
challenges and these rewards.

715
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:01,486
That's what happens when you

716
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,405
rest all day.

717
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:03,989
You get that burst of energy,

718
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:04,448
man.

719
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,825
I want to be the hero next

720
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,118
challenge or next immunity, you

721
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,119
know.

722
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,204
I'm gonna be the hero.

723
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,056
>> Tree mail.

724
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,432
>> Ah, this is going to be fun.

725
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,558
>> "Blood, sweat, tears and mud.

726
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,434
A day you'll give it all.

727
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,518
Stretching, pulling, scraping,

728
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:34,770
clawing.

729
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:35,562
This could be a brawl!

730
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:36,730
The hardest work since you've

731
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,065
arrived, will happen here today.

732
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,733
You decide how much sweat to

733
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:40,150
give.

734
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,401
Tonight one more goes away."

735
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,652
Pretty much a tug-of-war.

736
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:43,862
>> That's what I'm thinking.

737
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,490
>> Or it's like this right here.

738
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,741
One right here and one right

739
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:48,492
here and just get down.

740
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,410
>> Right.

741
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,536
>> We have a lot of really good

742
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,662
athletes on our team, but Yaxha

743
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:53,163
has been right there in

744
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,664
everything.

745
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,792
Stephenie, we know, is an

746
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,251
amazing athlete.

747
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:58,835
I work in sports radio back in

748
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,504
Kansas City.

749
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:03,340
Gary used to be a professional

750
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,549
football player.

751
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,176
He was the quarterback.

752
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:06,635
Quarterbacks, though,

753
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,221
aren't usually as athletic as

754
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,931
the rest of the football

755
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,724
players, but, uh... (<i> laughs)</i>

756
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,351
but he's been holding his own,

757
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,478
so we'll see what happens.

758
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,990
>> JEFF: Okay.

759
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:29,950
First things first.

760
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:33,954
Lydia, give it up.

761
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:37,916
Immunity back up for grabs.

762
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,668
Today's immunity challenge is a

763
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,795
good old-fashioned tug-of-war.

764
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,547
Both tribes will be connected to

765
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,465
each other with a common rope.

766
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,300
Your goal is to retrieve a tribe

767
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,802
flag.

768
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,303
There's a rope anchored at each

769
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,555
end of the field.

770
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,681
If you get to it, use it to pull

771
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,392
yourself to your flag.

772
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,144
At any time, tribe members from

773
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,187
either tribe can go back and try

774
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,689
to interfere with the other

775
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,691
tribe to impede their progress.

776
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,484
There is a time element to this

777
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,610
challenge.

778
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,612
If, after 15 minutes, neither

779
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,406
tribe has retrieved a single

780
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,740
flag, we'll move to a series of

781
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,701
one-on-one showdowns.

782
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,870
The tribe that wins this

783
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,580
challenge wins immunity,

784
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,248
guaranteed at least one more day

785
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,250

786
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,918
Losers, Tribal Council tonight.

Somebody going home.

788
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:24,713
Yaxha, you have one extra

Sitting somebody out.

791
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,048
Amy sat out the last challenge,

793

All right.

Danni, shoving him in the mud.

have and not doing anything.

822
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,288
Immunity at stake.

Somebody going home tonight.

If neither tribe has a flag in

whichever tribe member is closer

846

00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:07,180
first member.

952
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:07,889
Grab your flag.

953
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,933
Head on back to camp.

954
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,788
>> RAFE: You know, it was a

955
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:32,997
rough challenge today.

956
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,166
We gave it everything that we

957
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,460
had, but we just couldn't pull

958
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,546
their big man, and so now we

959
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,088
got Tribal tonight.

960
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:44,759
>> That challenge was miserable.

961
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:46,803
>> This is only gonna tie up,

962
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:47,387
you guys.

963
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,471
We're not down.

964
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,307
>> Just clean up and have a good

965
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,101
dinner, drink a lot.

966
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,687
>> I'm completely nervous.

967
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,481
This game to me is one big bag

968
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,440
of nerves.

969
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,650
It's the worst thing ever.

970
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:01,276
You always have to be on your

971
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,151
toes.

972
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,695
You always have to be watching.

973
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:07,156
>> Where do you want it?

974
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:12,996
>> I mean, she's nice, everybody

975
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:13,705
here is nice.

976
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:14,330
I love everybody here to death,

977
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,082
I'm not, you know what I'm

978
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:16,583
saying...

979
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,042
But that's my first pick.

980
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:18,960
I'm just gonna tell you all,

981
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,920
'cause I trust y'all, you know.

982
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,339
>> GARY: Jamie said, hey, we got

983
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,132
to get Steph off.

984
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,049
The girls love her.

985
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:25,592
You know?

986
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,175
She's gonna get us all off of

987
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,176
here.

988
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,012
The thing about that is we've

989
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,931
got to keep strength on our side

990
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:35,643
for those challenges so we win

991
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:35,977
them.

992
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,103
>> They want to get rid of me?

993
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,397
Has anybody said that?

994
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:39,647
>> Yeah.

995
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,024
>> They want to get rid of me.

996
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:41,983
>> Girl, where you been?

997
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:42,442
>> What did they said?

998
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,068
>> They are talking about you.

999
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,820
>> Getting rid of me?

1000
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:46,362
>> Yeah.

1001
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,071
>> Really?

1002
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:47,739
>> Who?

1003
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,073
>> Are you kidding?

1004
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,575
>> Jamie and them.

1005
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:51,117
>> Yeah.

1006
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,201
>> I never heard that.

1007
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,661
>> Don't take it personally.

1008
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,370
>> No, I'm not.

1009
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,538
I'm shocked about that.

1010
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:56,956
I guess it's just from

1011
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,374
inexperience on Jamie's part,

1012
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,126
and I'm not saying I'm a pro,

1013
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,086
but this early, I mean, clearly

1014
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,171
I am the strongest girl on the

1015
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,339
team.

1016
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,965
Why would they want to vote me

1017
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:06,674
off first?

1018
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,592
That's retarded.

1019
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,010
I refuse to go early this time.

1020
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,053
I refuse.

1021
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,025
>> Gary, were you a former

1022
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,653
NFL quarterback?

1023
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,905
>> Me? No.

1024
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,907
>> When I was tackling Danni and

1025
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,909
we were like sitting there, she

1026
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,702
goes, "You got a professional

1027
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,412
NFL linebacker on your team"

1028
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,622
and I said, "Who?"

1029
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:38,623
And she goes, "Gary."

1030
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:39,165
I was like...

1031
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:40,750
She goes, I bet he hasn't told

1032
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:41,042
you that.

1033
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,502
I said, how do you know, and

1034
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:43,419
she says "Oh, I'm a

1035
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,128
sportscaster, so I know him from

1036
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,213
then.

1037
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,465
>> It was brought up by Danni

1038
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,967
from Nakum that I played in the

1039
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,637
NFL, quarterback, and she told

1040
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,806
Brian that as they were

1041
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,724
wrestling in the mud.

1042
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:57,725
What the heck she was doing

1043
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,893
telling him that while she was

1044
00:32:58,976 --> 00:32:59,477
wrestling in the mud, I don't

1045
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,979
know, trying to disturb our

1046
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,022
tribe, I'll bet.

1047
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,190
>> That's pretty funny.

1048
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,525
>> Yeah, well, Danni is a

1049
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:06,109
sportscaster.

1050
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,735
>> Somebody needs to knock her

1051
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:07,902
out.

1052
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:10,238
>> GARY: I'm just going to deny

1053
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:13,074
and see how it goes.

1054
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,575
I'll play it by ear, because I

1055
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,660
think I'd be voted off

1056
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,495
immediately.

1057
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,061
>> Everybody is going around--

1058
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,354
What do we do? What do we do?

1059
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:43,688
What do we do?

1060
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,982
The two that I'm thinking about

1061
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,108
are Lydia and Morgan.

1062
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,067
Lydia is limited in the

1063
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:51,279
challenges compared to Morgan.

1064
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,281
But Morgan doesn't do very much

1065
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,949
in camp.

1066
00:33:55,032 --> 00:33:55,366
>> Morgan or Lydia.

1067
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,702
>> It's got to be Morgan, I

1068
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:57,910
think.

1069
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,037
>> But Morgan in an obstacle

1070
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,497
course is much quicker.

1071
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,457
I love Lydia.

1072
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm only saying Lydia because

1073
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,376
I love her, but Morgan is much

1074
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:05,710
more athletic.

1075
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,628
>> All right, longevity-wise

1076
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,297
who do you think will be better?

1077
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,298
...to get us to...

1078
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,257
>> Morgan, we can pick up

1079
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,468
like Lydia's doing.

1080
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,802
We can catch fish.

1081
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,095
>> We can pick up what Lydia is

1082
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,388
doing.

1083
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,181
>> I know she's lazy, but

1084
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:21,058
we need some big challengers.

1085
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:21,476
>> Okay.

1086
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,310
>> So we have a decision?

1087
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,811
>> Lydia.

1088
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,730
>> Well, I mean, is that what

1089
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:26,439
everyone...

1090
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:26,773
>> Yeah, yeah.

1091
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,357
You know how it is, I love

1092
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,026
Lydia, but, yeah, it has to be.

1093
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,444
>> One of the things that you

1094
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:32,111
can't do in this game is get

1095
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,489
emotional, so, from now till

1096
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,865
Tribal Council, I'm sure

1097
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,283
there's going to be a lot of

1098
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:39,535
thinking going on.

1099
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,356
>> Lydia's name came up because

1100
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,816
they think she's weaker because

1101
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:10,233
she's older.

1102
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:11,692
She's pulled her weight in

1103
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,151
challenges.

1104
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,528
She walked 11 miles with

1105
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,278
everybody else.

1106
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,655
The woman can do the work.

1107
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,240
I told her, I said, "Lydia, it's

1108
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,658
not looking good for you."

1109
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,743
Because she needs to know.

1110
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,546
>> Well, what's going on in camp

1111
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,923
right now is not in my favor at

1112
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:34,090
all.

1113
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,592
I mean, I know my head is on the

1114
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,261
chopping block tonight.

1115
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:39,178
I know that for a fact.

1116
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,389
Sounds like I'm going home.

1117
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,684
I just don't think it's right.

1118
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:47,019
I put my heart and soul into

1119
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,938
every single challenge, and I

1120
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,940
endeavored every single one of

1121
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:51,983
them, you know?

1122
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:55,278
So am I safe with you?

1123
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,244
Because, you know, whatever you

1124
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,247
guys want to do, I'll be there

1125
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:06,998
for you.

1126
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,417
>> I know that.

1127
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,211
>> I'm not ready to go, Gary.

1128
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,926
>> The main thing is that our

1129
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,887
tribe votes somehow unified.

1130
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,263
We don't want to have some crazy

1131
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,390
vote that no one expected and

1132
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:27,518
then us all be fractured at camp

1133
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:27,768
and stuff.

1134
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,937
The fact that we're going to

1135
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,647
Tribal Council tonight sucks so

1136
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,316
badly, but the hard reality of

1137
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,525
the game is that that's what

1138
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,694
happens.

1139
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:06,015
>> JEFF: Behind each of you is a

1140
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:06,223
torch.

1141
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,850
Go ahead and grab a torch and

1142
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:08,768
approach a flame.

1143
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:11,354
Dip it in and get fire.

1144
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:14,231
This is part of the ritual of

1145
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,984
Tribal Council because in this

1146
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,862
game fire represents your life.

1147
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:20,488
As long as you have fire you're

1148
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,239
still in the game.

1149
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,491
When your fire is gone, so are

1150
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:23,741
you.

1151
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:27,411
So catch me up on the status of

1152
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,871
this tribe.

1153
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:29,455
Steph, what was the reaction

1154
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,791
with you coming into this game

1155
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,125
having already played it?

1156
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:33,668
>> Actually they were really

1157
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:34,794
welcoming.

1158
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,253
I thought there might be a few

1159
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,129
negative reactions.

1160
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,506
I mean, I'm not an idiot.

1161
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,382
They know that I played this

1162
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,508
game.

1163
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,259
I know how the game works.

1164
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,844
But, um, we're one tribe and

1165
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:44,512
it's important just to win

1166
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,430
immunity and I feel that way and

1167
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,225
I hope they feel that way, but

1168
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,185
this game is a big bunch of lies

1169
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:52,019
half the time.

1170
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,521
>> JEFF: Jamie, what's the

1171
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,397
problem with having somebody

1172
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,482
like Steph out here?

1173
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,025
>> She knows the game really

1174
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:58,234
well.

1175
00:37:58,317 --> 00:37:59,568
She's always going to be a

1176
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,903
threat, and she's tough.

1177
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:01,529
She's not like a girl.

1178
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,073
She's more like a boy.

1179
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,366
>> JEFF: Who here of the women

1180
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:08,160
doesn't play like a guy?

1181
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:08,703
>> None of them play at the

1182
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:09,453
level Stephenie does,

1183
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,706
I don't think, in my opinion.

1184
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,999
>> JEFF: Lydia, just looking

1185
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:13,541
at you from the outside, you

1186
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,668
could say maybe you're the least

1187
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:16,919
equipped for this game.

1188
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,462
It must run through your head a

1189
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,297
little bit on this tribe if I'm

1190
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,549
the least athletic, I could be

1191
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,551
the first to go.

1192
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,094
>> Actually it is, Jeff.

1193
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,846
Sometimes, you know, you just

1194
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,973
feel like deep down inside are

1195
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,100
they really feeling that I can

1196
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:31,934
endure this?

1197
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:32,518
I think I've shown them, you

1198
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,645
know, that I'm a person that

1199
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,646
would never give up.

1200
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,440
>> JEFF: Morgan, the vibe I'm

1201
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:38,524
getting from you guys is this

1202
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:41,277
really is one unified group,

1203
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,445
but somebody is going home

1204
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:42,987
tonight.

1205
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,572
It's like it's an unspoken thing

1206
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,240
that nobody is talking about.

1207
00:38:46,323 --> 00:38:47,366
What's your take on that?

1208
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,785
>> I think that our tribe is

1209
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,454
very unified because we've been

1210
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,122
honest with each other up to

1211
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,749
this point and so I think that

1212
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,375
it's not an unspoken thing.

1213
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,294
I think we all kind of know

1214
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,129
what's going on, but somebody

1215
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,964
has to go and I don't want to

1216
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,758
say good-bye to anyone yet.

1217
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:04,467
>> JEFF: Rafe, what are you

1218
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,761
gonna base your vote on?

1219
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,429
>> Tonight I'm basing my vote on

1220
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,056
keeping this tribe unified.

1221
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,766
You know, we have grown to

1222
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,893
become something like a family

1223
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:14,518
out here and going home tonight

1224
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,812
without one of our members is

1225
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,481
going to be a crushing blow that

1226
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,316
hopefully we can move on from,

1227
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,318
and I truly believe that we can.

1228
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,569
>> JEFF: Okay, it is time to

1229
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:23,903
vote.

1230
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,696
Amy, you're up.

1231
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,418
>> I hope to high heaven this

1232
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:39,877
works.

1233
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,879
I scrambled at the last minute.

1234
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:55,851
>> Believe it or not, Lydia.

1235
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,228
This is going to be one of the

1236
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:57,812
hardest decisions that I make

1237
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,688
while I'm out here.

1238
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:12,785
>> JEFF: I'll go tally the

1239
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,870
votes.

1240
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,798
Once the votes are read, the

1241
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:26,924
decision is final.

1242
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:27,967
The person voted out will be

1243
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:28,884
asked to leave the Tribal

1244
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:29,844
Council area immediately.

1245
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,971
I'll read the votes.

1246
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:35,641
First vote, Morgan.

1247
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:40,563
Lydia.

1248
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:44,275
One vote Lydia, one vote Morgan.

1249
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:46,527
Morgan.

1250
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,319
Two votes Morgan.

1251
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,405
One vote Lydia.

1252
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:52,032
Morgan.

1253
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,034
That's three votes Morgan, one

1254
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,162
vote Lydia.

1255
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:58,706
Morgan.

1256
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,000
Four votes Morgan.

1257
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,002
One vote Lydia.

1258
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,298
Second person voted out of

1259
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:08,924
<i>Survivor: Guatemala,</i> Morgan.

1260
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:09,383
That's five.

1261
00:41:09,466 --> 00:41:09,717
That's enough.

1262
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,802
You need to bring me your torch.

1263
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:22,313
Morgan, the tribe has spoken.

1264
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:25,608
It's time for you to go.

1265
00:41:38,495 --> 00:41:40,122
Well, based on tonight's vote

1266
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:40,581
I'm a little confused.

1267
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,917
On the one hand, I do believe

1268
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,751
you're unified and tonight was a

1269
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,211
tough vote.

1270
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,503
On the other hand, the person

1271
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,671
voted out never saw it coming.

1272
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,006
Grab your torches and head on

1273
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:49,340
back to camp.

1274
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,799
Good night.

1275
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,481
>> Stay tuned for scenes from

1276
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,524
our next episode.

1277
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:10,778
>> JEFF: Next time on<i> Survivor,</i>

1278
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,197
Nakum defies the crocodiles.

1279
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:13,906
>> Everybody watches each

1280
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:14,573
other's backs from these

1281
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:15,574
crocodiles, we'll be all right.

1282
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:16,909
>> Even though we can't see

1283
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,494
them, there's probably hundreds

1284
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:19,036
in this lake.

1285
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,412
>> I've never felt more alive in

1286
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:20,955
my entire life.

1287
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,748
>> JEFF: And at Yaxha, Amy is in

1288
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:23,332
trouble.

1289
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:23,874
>> It's swollen.

1290
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:24,833
>> Did you hear it snap?

1291
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,378
>> Oh, yeah, snapped both sides.

1292
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,003
>> You'll have to stick needles

1293
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:28,796
in my eyeballs, I will not give

1294
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:29,046
up.

1295
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,804
>> Wow, I just didn't really see

1296
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,682
that one coming at all.

1297
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,600
I mean, I don't really know why

1298
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,643
I got voted off.

1299
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,395
I just feel really naive.

1300
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:44,937
Either way, it was such an

1301
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,646
amazing experience.

1302
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,773
You know, I got to live in

1303
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,149
Guatemala for almost a week and

1304
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,234
I've done a lot of things

1305
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:51,110
that I didn't think I

1306
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,945
could do, so the experience of

1307
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,530
it all was worth every second.
