1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,586
>> Jeff:
PREVIOUSLY ON<i> SURVIVOR.</i>

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,130
IN THE BATTLE
OF OLD VERSUS YOUNG,

3
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:07,048
THE YOUNGER TRIBE WAS THRIVING.

4
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:08,258
>> HANDS DOWN, WE'RE THE BOMB.

5
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:11,803
>> Jeff: AND THEIR HIERARCHY
WAS CLEARLY ESTABLISHED:

6
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:14,264
BRENDA, CHASE, NAONKA
AND SASH WERE ON TOP.

7
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:15,890
>> IT'S A GREAT FEELING TO KNOW

8
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,684
THAT YOU'RE ON THE SIDE
OF THE NUMBERS

9
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:19,644
AND TO HAVE CONTROL
THIS EARLY IN THE GAME.

10
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,938
>> Jeff: ALINA AND KELLY B.
WERE AT THE BOTTOM.

11
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:23,606
>> I DON'T LIKE YOU.
NEVER HAVE LIKED YOU.

12
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,068
I REALLY DON'T NEED
NO CHARITY CASE ON THE JURY.

13
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,403
>> Jeff: DROP YOUR BUFFS.

14
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:29,946
WE ARE SWITCHING TRIBES.

15
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,283
BUT A SURPRISE SWITCH PUT
OLD AND YOUNG ON BOTH TRIBES.

16
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:37,120
IT IS LA FLOR WEARING YELLOW
VERSUS ESPADA WEARING BLUE.

17
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,832
AT THE NEW LA FLOR, THE YOUNG
PEOPLE WERE IN CONTROL.

18
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,417
>> WE'RE FIVE AND THREE.
IT LOOKS GOOD.

19
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,294
>> Jeff: AND THEY TOOK JANE
UNDER THEIR WING.

20
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,628
>> I LIKE THESE KIDS!

21
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,088
>> Jeff:
DESPITE SHOWING EVERYONE

22
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,674
HIS HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL,
MARTY ENDED UP AT THE TOP

23
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:50,341
OF SASH AND BRENDA'S HIT LIST.

24
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,427
>> HE'S COMING INTO OUR HOME

25
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,637
AND ALREADY SETTING UP
LIKE HE'S THE KING.

26
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,474
(\INDISTINCT SHOUT\)

27
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,350
>> Jeff:
FABIO WINS IT FOR LA FLOR!

28
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,812
WHEN THE NEW ESPADA TRIBE
LOST THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE,

29
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,314
HOLLY JOINED UP
WITH THE YOUNG PEOPLE.

30
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:08,401
>> I HAVE A BETTER CHANCE
AT GOING FARTHER WITH THE KIDS.

31
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,153
>> Jeff: EVEN THOUGH DAN
WITH HIS BAD KNEE

32
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,155
WAS A PHYSICAL LIABILITY
TO THE TRIBE,

33
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,991
THE YOUNG DECIDED THAT TYRONE
WAS A BIGGER THREAT.

34
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:17,952
>> TYRONE RIGHT NOW, TYRONE...

35
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,830
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
EVERYONE VOTED AGAINST TYRONE,

36
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,876
EXCEPT FOR YVE, WHO WASN'T TOLD
ABOUT THE YOUNGSTERS' PLANS.

37
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,837
>> TYRONE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

38
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,963
>> GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

39
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,341
>> Jeff: 15 ARE LEFT.
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

40
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,044
>> TEN DAYS AGO I WAS READY
TO GET OUT OF HERE

41
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:11,381
AND IF ONE LESSON
I'VE LEARNED OUT HERE IS

42
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,340
QUITTING IS AN EASY WAY OUT.

43
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:16,219
IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE
THE RAIN, THE WIND,

44
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,763
YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT
OF THAT BEFORE YOU CAME.

45
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:22,684
YOU SIGNED UP FOR SOMETHING;
SUCK IT UP AND FINISH.

46
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,048
>> SO WHAT HAPPENED?

47
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,718
WHY DO I FEEL LIKE
I WAS LEFT OUT IN THE DARK

48
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,094
WITH YOU AND DANNY SO MUCH?

49
00:02:58,177 --> 00:02:59,262
BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE
BEEN FINE WITH THAT. I MEAN...

50
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,306
>> TYRONE?
>> YEAH.

51
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,349
>> I DON'T KNOW
IF DANNY AND I FELT THAT,

52
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,435
BECAUSE YOU HAD
AN ALLIANCE WITH HIM.

53
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,395
>> NO. NO, I DIDN'T.

54
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:10,565
IT SURPRISES ME THAT HOLLY
BELIEVES THAT TYRONE AND I

55
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,650
WERE AN ALLIANCE, AND THAT'S
WHY THEY COULDN'T TELL ME,

56
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,527
BECAUSE... WE WEREN'T.

57
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,195
IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH FOR ME,

58
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,447
BUT I'M NOT WALKING OUT OF HERE
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

59
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,284
I WAS KIND OF THINKING YOU AND I
HAD EACH OTHER'S BACKS A BIT

60
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,536
BUT NOW I'M KIND OF FEELING
LIKE A FISH OUT OF WATER.

61
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,454
>> MAYBE WE NEED TO BE
A LITTLE BIT MORE

62
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,497
OPEN AND HONEST WITH EACH OTHER.

63
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,499
>> MM-HMM. WELL...
>> BECAUSE...

64
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,794
BUT DANNY TOLD ME THIS MORNING
THAT HE'S DONE.

65
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,631
HE SAID, "I THINK I'M DONE."

66
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,632
AND I SAID "WHY?"
AND HE SAID

67
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:39,010
"I CAN'T TAKE THIS WEATHER
AND THIS HUT AND..."

68
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,470
>> I DON'T WANT TO THROW ANYBODY
UNDER THE BUS,

69
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,765
BUT DANNY DOESN'T WANT
TO BE HERE ANYMORE.

70
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,351
SO I'LL TAKE THAT INFORMATION
AND I'LL WORK AROUND THAT.

71
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,436
THAT'S THE GAME OF<i> SURVIVOR.</i>

72
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,439
YOU GOT TO DO WHAT
YOU GOT TO DO TO STAY ALIVE.

73
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,455
>> I THINK THEY ARE STARTING
TO APPRECIATE US.

74
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,290
YOU GET UP,
THE DISHES ARE CLEAN.

75
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,501
IT'S LIKE AT HOME;
MOM CLEANS THE DISHES.

76
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,336
>> I FEEL LIKE WE WENT FROM
BEING, LIKE, IN A SERIOUS DRAMA,

77
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,714
YOU KNOW, BEFORE ARRIVING HERE,
AND I FEEL LIKE I JUST FELL

78
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,467
INTO, LIKE,<i> BILL AND TED'S</i>
<i>EXCELLENT ADVENTURE,</i> YOU KNOW?

79
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:23,721
>> THE YOUNG TRIBE IS, LIKE, 180
DEGREES FROM WHERE WE CAME FROM.

80
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:27,684
WE WOULD GET UP, GET WOOD, FISH,
AND THESE GUYS SLEEP ALL DAY.

81
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,893
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT WE'VE BEEN DEALT

82
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:33,189
A VERY BAD HAND BY COMING ON
TO A TEAM IN MINORITY NUMBERS.

83
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:35,817
I FEEL LIKE THE YOUNG ONES
BONDED AND BONDED REALLY STRONG.

84
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,527
SO I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE
THEY'D GET RID OF US

85
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,530
IN A HEARTBEAT IF THEY COULD.

86
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,572
>> MORNING, FABIO.
>> MORNING.

87
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:45,201
>> HOW ARE YOU, MAN?
>> DOING WELL.

88
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:47,412
>> EVEN THOUGH
WE'RE ALL CALLED LA FLOR,

89
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,581
IT'S STILL YOUNGER TRIBE
AND OLDER TRIBE.

90
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,084
WELL, ACTUALLY,
IT'S YOUNGER TRIBE PLUS JANE.

91
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,503
(\LAUGHS\) I MEAN, LOOK AT JANE.
JANE BLENDS IN RIGHT AWAY

92
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:59,841
BECAUSE SHE'S JUST
A NATURAL, GENUINE HELPER.

93
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,427
SO IF WE GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL,
I THINK WHAT I WANT TO DO

94
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,512
IS HAVE THREE PEOPLE
VOTE FOR MARTY,

95
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:07,223
THREE PEOPLE VOTE FOR JILL.

96
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:08,558
THAT WAY YOU FLUSH OUT THE IDOL

97
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:12,478
AND... WHATEVER HAPPENS,
ONE OF THEM IS GOING HOME.

98
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,156
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

99
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:29,746
LA FLOR GETTING YOUR FIRST LOOK
AT THE NEW ESPADA TRIBE.

100
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,206
TYRONE VOTED OUT
AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

101
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,463
>> Jeff: GUYS READY TO GET
TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

102
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,131
>> YES, SIR.
>> YEAH.

103
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,425
>> Jeff: FIRST THING'S FIRST.
FABIO, I WILL TAKE IT BACK.

104
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,469
(\FABIO SIGHS HEAVILY\)

105
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,978
TRIBAL IMMUNITY IS NOT
WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING FOR TODAY.

106
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:00,109
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY
IS WHAT YOU SEEK.

107
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:05,448
BECAUSE TONIGHT BOTH TRIBES
ARE GOING TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

108
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:09,327
BOTH TRIBES WILL VOTE
SOMEBODY OUT OF THIS GAME.

109
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,663
THERE ARE TWO
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY NECKLACES,

110
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,665
BECAUSE ONE PERSON
FROM EACH TRIBE

111
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,460
WILL WIN IMMUNITY,
WILL BE SAFE AT TONIGHT'S VOTE.

112
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,962
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

113
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,632
ON MY GO, YOU'LL RACE OUT
INTO AN INDIVIDUAL DIGGING AREA.

114
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:26,177
YOU'LL USE A PADDLE
TO DIG UP A ROPE RING.

115
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,555
TOSS IT OVER YOUR SHOULDER
INTO A BASKET ON YOUR BACKSIDE,

116
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,681
THEN RACE IT BACK TO THE START.

117
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:35,186
THE FIRST PERSON TO GET
ALL THREE RINGS WINS IMMUNITY,

118
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,814
IS SAFE FROM THE VOTE,
AND MOVES ON TO THE FINAL ROUND

119
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,983
WHERE YOU WILL COMPETE
FOR TRIBAL REWARD.

120
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,820
IN THE FINAL ROUND,
THE WINNER FROM EACH TRIBE

121
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,656
WILL SQUARE OFF IN A RING TOSS.

122
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,325
FIRST PERSON TO LAND
ALL THREE OF THEIR RINGS

123
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:53,162
ON THE TARGET
WINS A FEAST FOR THEIR TRIBE.

124
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,705
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS:
THE WINNING TRIBE

125
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,584
WILL GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL FIRST
AND VOTE SOMEBODY OUT.

126
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:03,339
YOU WILL THEN LISTEN IN ON
THE OTHER TRIBE'S TRIBAL COUNCIL

127
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:08,344
WHILE YOU FEAST
ON CHICKEN AND BEEF KEBOBS.

128
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:08,970
WORTH PLAYING FOR?

129
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,139
>> YES!
>> ABSOLUTELY.

130
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,142
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, WE'LL DRAW
FOR SPOTS, WE'LL GET STARTED.

131
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,692
ALL RIGHT, ESPADA LOST
THE ROCK-PAPER-SCISSOR.

132
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,527
THEY'RE GOING FIRST.

133
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,989
ONE PERSON WILL WIN IMMUNITY
FROM THIS TRIBE.

134
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,657
HERE WE GO.
SURVIVORS READY?

135
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,494
GO.

136
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:38,207
THERE ARE THREE ROPE RINGS
BURIED IN THE SAND.

137
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,210
ONCE YOU FIND ONE,
TOSS IT OVER YOUR SHOULDER,

138
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,672
LAND IT IN THE BASKET
AND TAKE IT TO THE START.

139
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,049
DAN DROPS HIS RING.

140
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,634
ALINA GIVES IT A SHOT.

141
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,053
JUST MISSES.

142
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:51,762
HOLLY HAS HER FIRST RING.

143
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,515
OFF TO A QUICK START.

144
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,184
ALINA LANDS HER FIRST ONE.

145
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,186
YVE LANDS HER FIRST ONE.

146
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,605
BENRY LANDS HIS FIRST ONE.

147
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,940
HOLLY WITH HER SECOND RING...

148
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,066
AND LANDS IT.

149
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,693
HOLLY NOW IN THE LEAD WITH TWO!

150
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,863
ONE RING LEFT.

151
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,865
DAN STILL STRUGGLING.

152
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,786
ALINA DROPS HER SECOND ONE.

153
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,040
BENRY WITH A NICE TOSS!

154
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,250
BENRY ON THE BOARD
WITH HIS SECOND ONE.

155
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,919
CHASE HAS HIS FIRST!

156
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,213
DAN STILL NOWHERE.

157
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,756
IT IS HOLLY, ALINA AND BENRY

158
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,593
EACH LOOKING
FOR THEIR FINAL RING.

159
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,511
ALINA HAS HERS.

160
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,597
CAN SHE LAND IT?

161
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,599
NO.

162
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,977
HOLLY SCORES HER FINAL RING!

163
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,771
HOLLY MOVING ON TO THE FINAL!

164
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,482
(\APPLAUSE\)

165
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,901
NICELY DONE, HOLLY.

166
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,778
>> GOOD JOB, HOLLY.

167
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,072
>> Jeff: HOLLY,
SAFE FROM THE VOTE TONIGHT.

168

YOU'LL COMPETE WITH THE WINNER
FROM LA FLOR FOR A TRIBAL FEAST.

169
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:55,660
ESPADA, HIT YOUR MATS.

170
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,703
LA FLOR, YOU'RE UP.

171
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:05,253
ALL RIGHT, LA FLOR
NOW SEEKING INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.

172
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,421
SURVIVORS READY?

173
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,882

174
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,886
ONE MEMBER OF LA FLOR
WILL TAKE ON HOLLY IN THE FINAL.

175
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,307
SASH HAS HIS FIRST ONE.

176
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,809
BRENDA LANDS HER FIRST ONE.

177
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,687
BRENDA AND SASH
BOTH WITH ONE RING.

178
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,647
FABIO HAS HIS FIRST RING.

179
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,818
MARTY LANDS HIS FIRST ONE!

180
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,487
JILL HAS HER FIRST ONE.

181
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,281
KELLY B. HAS HER FIRST.

182
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:37,535
EVERYBODY ON THE BOARD
EXCEPT JANE AND PURPLE KELLY.

183
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,162
JANE HAS HER FIRST,
HEADING BACK.

184
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,831
MARTY HAS HIS SECOND.

185
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,667
KELLY B. HAS HER SECOND.

186
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,502
JILL HAS HER SECOND.

187
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,337
WE GOT A RACE!

188
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:53,676
IT IS JILL, MARTY AND KELLY B.
LOOKING FOR THEIR LAST RINGS.

189
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,177
JILL HAS HER LAST RING.

190
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,512
CAN SHE LAND IT?

191
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,346
NO.

192
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,348
KELLY B. NOW HAS HER THIRD.

193
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,766
JUST MISSES.

194
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,352
JILL WITH ANOTHER SHOT.

195
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,896
JILL LANDS HER FINAL RING!

196
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,732
JILL WINS IMMUNITY!

197
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:13,487
WILL TAKE ON HOLLY IN THE FINAL
FOR A FEAST.

198
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,572
CONGRATULATIONS.

199
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,824
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

200
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,576
>> Jeff:
JILL IS SAFE FROM THE VOTE.

201
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,203
JILL, YOU WILL TAKE ON HOLLY
FOR A TRIBAL FEAST.

202
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,247
LET'S MOVE.

203
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,169
HERE WE GO.

204
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,838
FIRST TO LAND
ALL THREE RINGS ON A HOOK

205
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,758
WINS FEAST FOR THEIR TRIBE.

206
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:37,094
SURVIVORS READY?

207
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,138
GO.

208
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,601
TWO PEOPLE
FROM THE ORIGINAL OLDER TRIBE

209
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,394
SQUARING OFF IN THIS CHALLENGE.

210
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,564
>> SLOW IT DOWN!
>> Jeff: JILL AND HOLLY.

211
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:49,607
>> YES!

212
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,858
>> Jeff:
HOLLY LANDS HER FIRST RING.

213
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:51,901
>> JILL, YOU'VE GOT IT.
TAKE YOUR TIME.

214
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,779
>> GET IN THE ZONE!

215
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,322
>> NICE!

216
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,908
>> Jeff: JILL LANDS HER FIRST
RING, AND THE SECOND RING.

217
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,911
JILL AND HOLLY BOTH WITH TWO!

218
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,746
ONE RING LEFT.

219
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:07,083
JILL OR HOLLY
CAN WIN IT RIGHT HERE.

220
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,626
>> GO, JILL!

221
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:13,422
>> Jeff:
HOLLY JUST MISSES.

222
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,884
JILL WINS FEAST FOR LA FLOR!

223
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,599
>> WE'RE GONNA EAT!

224
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,101
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT,
HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

225
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,936
TONIGHT, LA FLOR,
YOU WILL GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL

226
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:31,232
AND VOTE SOMEBODY OUT,
THEN LISTEN IN

227
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,943
ON ESPADA'S TRIBAL COUNCIL,
AND WHILE DOING SO,

228
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:38,447
YOU WILL FEAST
ON CHICKEN AND BEEF KEBOBS.

229
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,782
LA FLOR, ESPADA, SEE YOU
TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

230
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,827
GRAB YOUR STUFF,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

231
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,967
>> HEY! WINNER, WINNER, WINNER!

232
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,469
IT'S JUST SUCH A GOOD FEELING

233
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,638
TO KNOW THAT
WE'RE GONNA EAT TONIGHT.

234
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,852
>> ...FOR PICKING ME
TO BE ON THIS TEAM.

235
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,354
>> AWESOME.
>> ONE, TWO, THREE...

236
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,647
>> LA FLOR!

237
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,982
>> THE LITTLE
"ONE, TWO, THREE, LA FLOR!"

238
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,484
THAT WAS TOTALLY FAKE.

239
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,486
I MEAN, JILL AND MARTY, COME ON.

240
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,697
YOU COULD SEE THAT
THEY'RE WORKING THEIR MINDS,

241
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,198
THEY'RE WORKING
THEIR OWN LITTLE THING.

242
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,533
YOU JUST FEEL IT.

243
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,994
BUT WORST-CASE SCENARIO
HAPPENED.

244
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,996
JILL WON INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY,

245
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,499
MARTY HAS THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL, SO NOW WE'RE STUCK.

246
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,462
BUT WE WILL SOMEHOW VOTE
SOMEONE OUT THAT WE DON'T WANT.

247
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,342
>> SO WHAT I WAS THINKING--

248
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,471
TELL ME IF YOU WERE THINKING
THE SAME THING--

249
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:47,016
WE SPLIT THE VOTES,
THREE VOTES... FOR MARTY

250
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,185
AND THREE VOTES FOR KELLY B.

251
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,853
WE TELL KELLY B., THOUGH,

252
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,813
THAT OUR THREE VOTES
ARE GOING FOR...

253
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,148
>> JANE. Yep.
>> JANE.

254
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,858
>> IT'S JUST THAT EASY.
>> THAT EASY.

255
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,860
>> OKAY. COOL.
>> COOL.

256
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,529
>> SINCE JILL WON
THE INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY TODAY,

257
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,032
OUR WHOLE STRATEGY
KIND OF CHANGES AT THIS POINT.

258
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,035
SO THE PLAN FOR TONIGHT IS

259
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,997
WE'LL SPLIT THE VOTE
BETWEEN MARTY AND KELLY B.,

260
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,999
AND HOPEFULLY FLUSH THE IDOL.

261
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:15,085
>> COCONUT!
>> COCONUT! YAY!

262
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:19,507
>> I'M EXCITED ABOUT
THE PLAN THAT WE HAVE IN STORE,

263
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,343
BECAUSE KELLY B. HAS NEVER BEEN
A PART OF OUR ALLIANCE.

264
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,220
YOU KNOW, SHE WAS GUNNING
FOR ME FROM THE START,

265
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,555
PLUS SHE HAS A FAKE LEG.

266
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,016
SO I THINK PEOPLE WOULD GIVE
KELLY B. A MILLION DOLLARS

267
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,727
BECAUSE THEY FEEL BAD FOR HER.

268
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,437
AND, YOU KNOW,
YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE

269
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,813
SOMEONE LIKE THAT AROUND.

270
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:38,234
>> SO WE NEED TO SPLIT
THREE AND THREE?

271
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:42,404
>> I MEAN, I LIKE JANE, BUT I
FEEL LIKE OUR HAND WAS FORCED.

272
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,240
I REALLY WANTED
TO SEE JANE AROUND HERE

273
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,324
FOR AS LONG
AS WE COULD KEEP HER,

274
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:48,911
BUT I'VE BEEN ON THE OUTS
WITH THE LA FLOR GROUP

275
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,038
SO THE BEST THING I CAN DO
IS JUST KIND OF LAY LOW

276
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,040
AND VOTE WITH EVERYONE ELSE.

277
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,422
>> YEAH.

278
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,967
TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL
IS NOT GONNA BE EASY,

279
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:07,596
BECAUSE I HAVE TO, LIKE, MAKE
SURE ALL THESE PIECES ARE SET.

280
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,516
AND YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT FABIO'S GOING TO DO.

281
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,226
I MEAN, HE'S CLUELESS,

282
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,229
SO IT'S GOING TO BE
A LITTLE COMPLICATED.

283
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,569
>> DUDE, I HAVE NOT
TOLD ANYBODY THIS,

284
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:26,615
NOT EVEN ON MY OWN TRIBE,
BUT I AM...

285
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,034
A GRAND MASTER IN CHESS.

286
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,123
AND HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF GUILLERMO VILA BEFORE?

287
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,458
>> NO, MAN, ALL I'VE HEARD OF
IS BOBBY FISCHER.

288
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,086
>> OKAY, WELL, GUILLERMO VILAS
IS AN ARGENTINE GRAND MASTER.

289
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,089
WHEN I WAS A KID,
I BEAT HIM TWICE.

290
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,299
>> Ha!

291
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,175
>> AND WHEN YOU WANT
TO TALK LATER, MAN...

292
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,845
>> I'M TAKING ORDERS, BRO.
>> IF YOU WANT TO...

293
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,179
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE
THE BIGGEST MOVE OF THIS GAME

294
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:53,851
EVER IN<i> SURVIVOR,</i>
I'VE GOT IT ALL LAID OUT.

295
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,312
ACTUALLY, I'M NOT
A GRAND MASTER IN CHESS.

296
00:14:56,395 --> 00:15:00,149
AND THE ARGENTINE GRAND MASTER
OF ALL TIME, GUILLERMO VILAS,

297
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,151
HE'S ONE OF THE GREATEST
TENNIS PLAYERS OF ALL TIME

298
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,362
BUT CLEARLY HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH CHESS.

299
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,907
SO I COULD PULL ANYTHING
OUT OF THE '70S ON THESE GUYS

300
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,659
AND THEY WOULDN'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

301
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,328
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE BEAUTY IS?

302
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,663
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO MAKE ANY DECISIONS.

303
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,792
>> WHEN MARTY SAYS,
"I AM A GRAND MASTER IN CHESS,"

304
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,211
I'M JUST THINKING...

305
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,340
DUH, LIKE IT MAKES SE...
IT DOES MAKE SENSE, MAN.

306
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,342
HE'S ALWAYS TALKING
ABOUT IT'S A NUMBERS GAME,

307
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,219
AND YOU CAN SEE HIM DOING
ALL THESE NUMBERS IN HIS HEAD,

308
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,680
AND I'M, LIKE, SIGN ME UP.

309
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,682
IT SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD DEAL, YOU KNOW?

310
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,534
>> YOU CAN NEVER BE TOO COCKY,
YOU CAN NEVER BE TOO CONFIDENT.

311
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:57,039
BUT IF I CAN PULL THIS OFF, IT
COULD BE A WHOLE NEW BALL GAME.

312
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,841
>> OH.
>> FIRE THIS BABY UP.

313
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,885
>> I JUST KEPT TOSSING
AND TOSSING AND I WAS, LIKE...

314
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:11,095
>> OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
>> I KNOW.

315
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,264
FOR ME TO WIN
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY IS GOOD,

316
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,225
BUT AT THE SAME POINT,
THE OTHER TRIBE GETS TO WATCH

317
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:20,062
OUR TRIBAL COUNCIL,
THEY GET TO EAT IN FRONT OF US,

318
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,065
SO IT'S NOT GONNA BE
A LOT OF FUN.

319
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,233
I JUST KEPT THINKING
ABOUT FOOD AND...

320
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,069
FOR TONIGHT'S VOTE,
I HAVE INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY,

321
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:31,240
AND THE FOUR YOUNG
ESPADA MEMBERS

322
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,742
DEFINITELY HAVE
THE NUMBERS ADVANTAGE.

323
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,202
SO AT THIS POINT,
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO GO

324
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:38,455
WITH THE MAJORITY,
AND THE CHOICES TONIGHT

325
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,125
FOR WHO WE CAN VOTE FOR
ARE DAN AND YVE.

326
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:46,338
SO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS
ON TONIGHT?

327
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,217
I'M GETTING EXHAUSTED
WITH THIS STUFF.

328
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,265
IT'S VERY HARD
BEING HERE AND LIVING HERE.

329
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,976
THE FOOD SITUATION IS BAD,
WEATHER SITUATION IS BAD,

330
00:16:59,059 --> 00:16:59,643
EVERYTHING'S BAD.

331
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,270
AND I DON'T NEED THE MONEY.

332
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,272
I GOT A RANGE ROVER,
I GOT A FERRARI.

333
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,441
I MEAN, WHY IN THE WORLD
AM I DOING THIS?

334
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,984
>> WHEN YOU TALKED TO ME
THIS MORNING,

335
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,610
I GUESS I JUST WANT TO KNOW...

336
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,947
>> THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
>> OKAY. YOU CAN'T QUIT.

337
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,991
I FEEL LIKE DAN
WANTS TO GIVE UP,

338
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,160
BUT NOW HE TOLD ME
HE DOES NOT WANT TO GO HOME.

339
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:19,913
HE NEEDS TO BE HONEST, BECAUSE
IF HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE HERE,

340
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,874
THERE'S PEOPLE
THAT WANT TO BE HERE.

341
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,419
>> WHY? WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

342
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:28,464
>> I MEAN, I THINK
IT SHOULD BE YVE THAT GOES.

343
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,674
I'D MUCH RATHER GO
TO THE MERGE WITH DANNY.

344
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,969
I PERSONALLY WANT
TO GET RID OF YVE TONIGHT,

345
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:38,140
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO TAKE HER TO THE MERGE.

346
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,057
SHE'S A SMART PLAYER.

347
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,851
SHE'S HERE TO PLAY
FOR THE MILLION DOLLARS.

348
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:45,439
DAN, I KNOW FOR A FACT HE'S NOT
A THREAT TO ME WHATSOEVER,

349
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,816
SO IT'S REALLY
A NO-BRAINER TONIGHT FOR ME

350
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,485
TO WANT TO VOTE YVE OUT.

351
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,488
REGARDLESS, US FOUR,
IF WE STICK TOGETHER...

352
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,822
>> FOUR YOUNG.
>> YEAH.

353
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,365
>> I KNOW.
>> WE'RE SET.

354
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,326
>> I KNOW.
>> THE DYNAMIC BETWEEN

355
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,621
THE FOUR ORIGINAL LA FLOR GUYS
IS WE SAY WE TRUST EACH OTHER,

356
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,040
THE ONLY ONE
I REALLY TRULY TRUST IS NAONKA.

357
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:06,335
BENRY AND ALINA, I THINK
THEY COULD SWITCH LIKE THAT.

358
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,670
BEST SCENARIO FOR ME TONIGHT?

359
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,674
IT COULD POSSIBLY BE
TO KEEP YVE.

360
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,176
>> HERE'S WHAT WE'RE FACING.

361
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,304
IF WE KEEP LOSING,
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THIS.

362
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:21,809
YVE'S KIND OF CLOSE TO ME,
SO I THINK SHE WOULD TRUST ME.

363
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,895
DAN, THE ONLY THING HE COULD
BE SWAYED POSSIBLY BY BENRY

364
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,438
TO, LIKE, BLIND-SIDE ME
OR SOMETHING.

365
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,733
>> CHASE AND I,
WE ARE REALLY CONFUSED

366
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,193
ON WHO WE WOULD WANT OUT.

367
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,529
IF IT WAS MY CHOICE,
I WOULD CHOOSE DAN TO GO HOME,

368
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,531
BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY
THAT IF WE CONTINUE KEEPING HIM

369
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,407
IN THIS GAME, WE'RE GONNA WIN.

370
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,035
DAN'S KNEES ARE ABOUT TO CRACK.

371
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:42,538
HE'S ABOUT TO START WALKING
ON HIS KNEES. (\LAUGHS\)

372
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:47,000
SOONER OR LATER, HE'S
ABOUT TO BE WALKING ON NUBS.

373
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,419
>> HOLLY WON IMMUNITY,
AND THE YOUNG TRIBE,

374
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,922
THEY'RE PRETTY TIGHT,
SO IT'S ME OR DAN.

375
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,174
AND WE'VE BEEN
TO A LOT OF TRIBALS

376
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:57,427
WHEN DAN'S NAME GETS WRITTEN
DOWN, BUT HE'S NOT VOTED OUT.

377
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,681
MAYBE HE'S JUST GOT A LITTLE
SOMEONE SITTING ON HIS SHOULDER

378
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,891
WATCHING OUT FOR HIM
THAT I'M HOPING JUMPS SHIP

379
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,560
AND COMES OVER
TO MY SHOULDER TONIGHT.

380
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,020
>> I HAVE TO TELL YOU GIRLS,
I SURE AS HELL

381
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,940
DON'T WANT TO GO HOME, AND I'M
HERE COMMITTED 100% OF THE TIME.

382
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,358
>> WELL, AT THIS POINT,
IT'S STILL A TRIBE GAME,

383
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:15,571
SO OBVIOUSLY,
WE NEED STRONG PEOPLE.

384
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,613
I THINK IT'S GOT TO BE DAN.

385
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,408
>> HOLLY SAID THIS MORNING
HE SAID "I'M DONE."

386
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,618
AND I'M NOT HERE
TO QUIT HALFWAY.

387
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,453
AND OUT OF THE THREE OF US,
WHEN WE DO MERGE,

388
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,915
I KNOW ALL THREE OF THEM
ON THE OTHER SIDE

389
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,418
MORE INTIMATELY THAN THEY DO.

390
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:33,922
WHICH WOULD COMPLETELY BENEFIT
YOU TWO... (\INDISTINCT\)

391
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,924
SO ANYWAY,
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT, OKAY?

392
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,260
>> NO, I THINK WE WERE
ALREADY ON THE SAME PAGE.

393
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,261
>> ALL RIGHT.

394
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,388
>> YVE CAME UP TO ME AND NAONKA
AND SHE SAID,

395
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,806
"I'M ACTUALLY VALUABLE
TO YOU GUYS

396
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,057
"BECAUSE WHEN
WE GET TO THE MERGE,

397
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,435
I HAVE REALLY GOOD RELATIONSHIPS
WITH THE OLD ESPADA TRIBE."

398
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,562
AND I'M THINKING,
IF WE GET YOU TO THE MERGE

399
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,105
AND YOU HAVE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS,

400
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:52,399
WHAT MAKES US THINK THAT YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO SWITCH ON US?

401
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:55,152
CLEARLY, DAN ISN'T
STRONG PHYSICALLY.

402
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,905
BUT THE PROBLEM WITH YVE IS
THAT YVE IS PLAYING REALLY HARD.

403
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,324
SO IN MY HEAD I WENT, WOW,
THAT'S THE PERFECT ARGUMENT

404
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,367
TO GET RID OF HER.

405
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,429
>> 100%.
>> OKAY.

406
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,690
>> I THINK IT'S
ALWAYS MOST IMPORTANT

407
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,525
TO KEEP THE TRIBE STRONG
PHYSICALLY,

408
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,152
BUT, THEN, AT THE SAME TIME,

409
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:38,987
I THINK THAT YVE MIGHT DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES

410
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,322
TO GET HERSELF, YOU KNOW,
FURTHER IN THE GAME.

411
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,491
SO SHE COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS.

412
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:46,495
JUST NEED TO BE SURE THIS IS
THE RIGHT THING FOR US TO DO.

413
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,789
>> YOU GUYS GOT TO TELL ME
WHAT YOU THINK.

414
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,666
I MEAN, THIS IS GETTING
DOWN TO THE WIRE.

415
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,168
>> DO NOT FOLLOW YOUR HEART,
FOLLOW YOUR GUT.

416
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:55,671
IT WOULD BE DAN, BECAUSE WHAT
IF WE HAVE ANOTHER CHALLENGE

417
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,881
THAT'S SUPER PHYSICAL
AND HIS KNEES HURT?

418
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,508
THEN WHAT?

419
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,177
FIRST CHASE WANTED
TO VOTE FOR DAN.

420
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,346
NOW IT SOUNDS LIKE
CHASE WANTS YVE TAKEN OUT.

421
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,974
OKAY, THAT'S WHAT YOU GUYS
WANT TO DO, TELL ME.

422
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,643
TELL ME RIGHT NOW, IS THAT
WHAT YOU GUYS WANT ME TO DO,

423
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,187
BECAUSE I'LL RIGHT HER NAME DOWN
AND I'LL SMILE IN HER FACE.

424
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,231
THAT'S OUT-WIN.

425
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,451
>> YEAH.
>> YEAH.

426
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:28,537
>> YEAH.

427
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,380
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
COULD HAVE GUESSED IT,

428
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:42,592
BUT WE ALWAYS WANTED
TO GET MARTY.

429
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,846
>> RIGHT.

430
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:46,555
>> THEY'VE BEEN MY ENEMIES
FROM DAY ONE.

431
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,644
I'LL DO WHATEVER
Y'ALL WANT ME TO DO, HONEY.

432
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,897
I'M AS THICK AS
PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY

433
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,441
WITH THE YOUNGER LA FLOR TRIBE,

434
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:00,569
SO I HAVE
A LITTLE SMILE ON MY FACE

435
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,404
'CAUSE I BELIEVE
WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND,

436
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:08,118
BECAUSE THOSE TWO NEVER
PULLED ME INTO THEIR ALLIANCE.

437
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,746
THEY'VE BEEN CONNIVING
SINCE DAY ONE.

438
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,665
SO I HOPE IT GOES
THE WAY BRENDA'S PLANNED IT.

439
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,799
>> NO.

440
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,259
>> WHAT WE'RE THINKING IS,

441
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:28,096
WE GOT TO FLUSH THE IDOL
AWAY FROM MARTY.

442
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,724
SO WE'RE THINKING
THAT WE SPLIT THE VOTES.

443
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,769
THREE VOTES FOR MARTY...

444
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,605
AND THREE VOTES FOR KELLY B.

445
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,941
>> DO WE WANT TO FLUSH THE IDOL
FROM MARTY?

446
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:40,984
>> WHY NOT?

447
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,737
I MEAN, IT'S DANGEROUS
TO HAVE HIM HOLD ON TO IT.

448
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,282
MARTY'S A SMART GUY, HE'S GOING
TO USE HIS IDOL TONIGHT, OKAY?

449
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,326
>> I DON'T KNOW.
>> HE WILL, TRUST ME.

450
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,494
IF YOU VOTE FOR MARTY...

451
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:53,955
>> I DON'T...
MAN, I LIKE MARTY.

452
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,999
SASH WANTS ME TO VOTE FOR MARTY,

453
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,794
BUT I WANT MARTY
TO STICK AROUND.

454
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,420
HE'S A SMART GUY,

455
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,589
HE'S LET ME IN ON SOME
OF HIS SECRETS, YOU KNOW?

456
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:05,967
SO I FEEL LIKE
I'M KIND OF IN GOOD WITH HIM.

457
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,428
>> IT'S JUST TOO DANGEROUS
FOR HIM TO HOLD ON

458
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,681
TO THAT IMMUNITY IDOL UNTIL
WHENEVER HE WANTS TO USE IT.

459
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,642
IF EVERYTHING GOES
ACCORDING TO PLAN,

460
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,645
WE'LL BE ABLE TO KILL
A COUPLE BIRDS WITH ONE STONE.

461
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,480
BUT FABIO IS SO UP IN THE AIR
ALL THE TIME,

462
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:22,442
WHO KNOWS WHICH WAY
THE WIND IS BLOWING

463
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:26,113
THIS EVENING,
SO SOMETHING COULD GO WRONG.

464
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,535
>> I REALLY WANT
TO STAY IN THE GAME.

465
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:35,038
ANYTHING I CAN DO.

466
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,082
I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME.

467
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,755
I MEAN, ARE YOU...

468
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,635
>> HEY, MAN, YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS GAME'S ALL ABOUT, YOU KNOW?

469
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,387
AS LONG AS IT'S NOT ME
GOING HOME

470
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,180
AND YOU GUYS ARE STRAIGHT UP
AND REALLY HONEST

471
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,182
ABOUT THAT'S THE WAY
THE CHIPS ARE GOING TO FALL,

472
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,309
YOU KNOW,
THEN I'M GOOD WITH THAT.

473
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,435
>> OKAY.

474
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,272
>> I THOUGHT WITH FABIO
WE COULD MAYBE SHAKE THINGS UP,

475
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,065
BUT I THINK
IT'S PROBABLY TOO DICEY,

476
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:05,527
IT'S PROBABLY SAFER
TO GO WITH JANE TONIGHT.

477
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,571
BUYS US A LITTLE TIME.

478
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,578
>> THE VOTE WILL BE DETERMINED

479
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,330
BY WHAT MARTY DOES
WITH THE IDOL.

480
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,500
IF HE PLAYS THE IDOL,
KELLY B.'S GOING HOME.

481
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:23,837
IF MARTY DOESN'T PLAY THE IDOL,
IT WILL BE A TIE.

482
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,548
AND WE'LL HAVE
TO MAKE A TOUGH DECISION,

483
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,551
BECAUSE MARTY IS
THE NUMBER-ONE ENEMY RIGHT NOW,

484
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,344
BECAUSE HE'S A HUGE SCHEMER.

485
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:34,055
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO KEEP

486
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,559
A PISSED-OFF KELLY B.
WHO CAN WIN THE WHOLE THING?

487
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:41,188
SO ENEMY; KELLY B.

488
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,232
I DON'T KNOW.

489
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,193
>> UH, FABIO
DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE

490
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:49,196
PUTTING HIS VOTE FOR MARTY.

491
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,789
IT'S A VERY,
VERY CALCULATED DECISION

492
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:00,749
TO PLAY OR NOT PLAY THE IDOL.

493
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:04,211
MY GUT IS TELLING ME
THEY WILL VOTE FOR JANE,

494
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,213
SO I'LL HANG ON TO IT.

495
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,631
IT WOULD ONLY BUY ME
ONE MORE TRIBAL COUNCIL ANYWAYS.

496
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:11,509
BUT IT COULD VERY WELL BE ME
GOING HOME TONIGHT

497
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:14,512
IF I MAKE THE WRONG DECISION.

498
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,743
>> Jeff:
MARTY, OBVIOUS DISPARITY.

499
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:39,246
FIVE YOUNG; THREE OLD.

500
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:42,415
EVEN LOOKING AT THIS GROUP,
YOU AND JILL AND JANE,

501
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,875
YOU KIND OF LOOK
LIKE YOU DON'T MAYBE FIT IN.

502
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,461
>> YEAH,
THINGS CHANGED RADICALLY.

503
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:47,754
YOU'RE IN ONE POSITION ONE DAY

504
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,839
AND... JUST LIKE THAT,
IT ALL CHANGES.

505
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,509
SO THE IMPORTANT THING IS,
THIS TRIBE IS ALL ABOUT WINNING,

506
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:53,927
SO IF YOU CONTRIBUTE
TOWARDS THAT

507
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,929
AND DO YOUR WORK AROUND CAMP,
I THINK, YOU KNOW,

508
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,806
THINGS HOPEFULLY GO YOUR WAY.

509
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,267
>> Jeff: SASH,
ON DAY ONE OF THIS NEW TRIBE,

510
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,353
WHAT DID MARTY DO
TO TRY TO MAKE HIMSELF WORTHY?

511
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:06,815
>> VERY FIRST DAY,
MARTY KIND OF CALLED A MEETING

512
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,901
TO NOT ONLY INTRODUCE HIMSELF
BUT HE ALSO MENTIONED TO US

513
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:13,863
THAT HE WAS HOLDING ON
TO THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

514
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:14,823
>> Jeff: SO, MARTY,
YOU TOLD EVERYBODY

515
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,866
THAT YOU HAD
A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL?

516
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:21,162
>> YEAH, I MEAN, I THOUGHT
TO GET OFF ON THE BEST START

517
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,164
THAT I COULD WITH THIS TRIBE
WAS TO COME CLEAN

518
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,166
AND LET THEM KNOW,
HEY, LISTEN, I HAVE THE IDOL,

519
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,294
I'M GOING TO HANG IT
RIGHT OUT ON THE TREE,

520
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,671
AND BY DOING SO, HOPEFULLY
IT BOUGHT ME SOME GOODWILL

521
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:30,922
AND SHOWED THEM WHAT KIND
OF GAME I'VE BEEN PLAYING,

522
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:34,384
WHICH HAS BEEN A REALLY, REALLY
STRAIGHT GAME FROM DAY ONE.

523
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,678
>> Jeff: BRENDA, ON ONE HAND,
THIS IS A GESTURE OF GOODWILL,

524
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,638
"I'M GOING
TO LET YOU KNOW I HAVE IT."

525
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,641
ON THE OTHER HAND, HE'S SAYING,
"WATCH OUT, I GOT IT."

526
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,310
>> TOTALLY. YEAH, DEFINITELY.

527
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,478
AND SO I FEEL LIKE
MAYBE IS HE TRYING

528
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:49,190
TO MAKE IT LOOK
MORE NOBLE THAN IT REALLY IS.

529
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,359
>> Jeff: SO, MARTY,
NOW YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT,

530
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,529
ARE THEY GOING TO GUN FOR ME
AND TRY TO GET ME TO PLAY IT,

531
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:57,157
OR ARE THEY GOING TO TELL ME I'M
SAFE, HOPING I WON'T PLAY IT,

532
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,451
AND GET RID OF ME
AND THE IDOL IN ONE FELL SWOOP?

533
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,161
>> YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.
I MEAN, YOU DON'T THINK

534
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,746
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS
A LITTLE BIT, JUST A WEE BIT,

535
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,373
OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS?

536
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:09,085
THIS GAME IS ALSO ABOUT TRUSTING
PEOPLE THAT I'VE TALKED TO,

537
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,504
AS FAR AS "TRUST"
GETS YOU IN THIS GAME,

538
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:12,839
AND, I DON'T KNOW,
I'M GETTING MIXED VIBES,

539
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,717
AND IT'D BE TERRIBLE
TO GO HOME TONIGHT

540
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,052
WITH AN IDOL IN MY POCKET,

541
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:17,844
BUT YOU GOT
TO TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS

542
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,555
AND TRY TO STAY TRUE TO THEM.

543
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:23,391
>> Jeff: KELLY B.,
MARTY SAYS-- AS FAR AS YOU CAN

544
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,851
TRUST SOMEONE IN THIS GAME.

545
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:28,730
HOW FAR CAN YOU TRUST SOMEONE
IN THIS GAME?

546
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,190
>> I THINK, LIKE HE SAID,

547
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,399
YOU HAVE TO GO
WITH YOUR GUT INSTINCT.

548
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,194
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE GOING
TO TELL YOU WHAT THEY NEED TO,

549
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:37,405
SO I WOULDN'T TRUST
TOO MANY PEOPLE.

550
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,407
>> Jeff: SPEAKING
FOR MARTY OR FOR YOURSELF?

551
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,867
>> I MEAN, FOR ANYONE HERE.

552
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,287
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, EVERYONE'S
GOT THEIR OWN INTENTIONS.

553
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,581
>> Jeff: AND SO HOW COMFORTABLE
ARE YOU TONIGHT,

554
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:50,460
IN TERMS OF TRUSTING
THESE OTHER PEOPLE?

555
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:53,254
>> I FEEL
PRETTY COMFORTABLE TONIGHT.

556
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,214
>> Jeff: JANE, HOW ABOUT YOU?

557
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,799
DO YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE PART OF THE MAJORITY?

558
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:58,927
>> I MEAN, THEY MIGHT CONSIDER
ME ONE OF THE "WEAKER PEOPLE,"

559
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,930
AS FAR AS STRENGTH GOES.

560
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,265
>> Jeff: BRENDA,
DOES JANE HAVE REASON TO WORRY?

561
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:08,395
>> NO. SHE HAS TO WORRY FOR
JILL AND MARTY VOTING HER OUT.

562
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:12,732
THAT'S THE TRUTH.

563
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,609
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.

564
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:16,611
>> COME ON, MARTY.

565
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,948
>> ME AND JILL ARE TWO,
YOU GUYS ARE FIVE,

566
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:23,618
SO THAT'S REALLY SWEET OF YOU
TO PUT THAT ON ME.

567
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:24,953
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT ME AND JILL,

568
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,122
SO APPRECIATE ALL THAT.

569
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,748
>> BUT WHAT DID YOU
TELL ME TODAY?

570
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,291
>> BUT... THAT'S NOT...

571
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,668
THAT'S NOT WHAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

572
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,253
YOU SAID WHAT
SHE HAS TO WORRY ABOUT.

573
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:35,338
WHAT SHE HAS TO WORRY ABOUT
ARE NUMBERS.

574
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,382
THESE TWO NUMBERS HERE
DON'T ADD UP TO A LOT.

575
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,925
>> FIVE DO. SO YOU'RE WRONG.
>> I KNOW, BUT...

576
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,468
>> NO, I'M JUST SAYING
YOU'RE WRONG.

577
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,637
>> I'M NOT CAMPAIGNING FOR JANE
TO BE OUT; YOU GUYS WERE.

578
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,471
>> I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

579
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,433
I'M JUST SAYING
LA FLOR MADE THE CALL.

580
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,809
I DIDN'T MAKE THAT CALL.

581
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,978
>> BUT YOU DID SAY THAT.
>> SO IF I APPROACHED YOU,

582
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:50,979
IT WAS TO GET CONSENSUS
WITHIN YOUR TRIBE

583
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,940
TO MAKE SURE THAT
YOU GUYS ARE IN AGREEMENT.

584
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:57,819
I NEVER OFFERED UP JANE.

585
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:58,987
>> Jeff: MARTY,
YOU FEELING MORE COMFORTABLE,

586
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,157
LESS COMFORTABLE, SAME AS
YOU WERE WHEN YOU WALKED IN?

587
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,159
>> UH, PROBABLY LESS COMFORTABLE

588
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,120
SIMPLY BECAUSE I TOOK
THESE GUYS AT FACE VALUE

589
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:09,038
AND I FEEL THERE'S
A LOT OF, UH, DUPLICITY,

590
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,958
BASED ON SOME
OF THE COMMENTS MADE HERE.

591
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,294
I NEVER INITIATED
A VOTE ON JANE.

592
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,045
THAT WOULD BE MORONIC OF ME.

593
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:19,466
THAT CONNIVING
AND BACKSTABBING KIND OF STUFF

594
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,843
THAT THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T LIKE
MAKES ME FEEL A LITTLE UNEASY,

595
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,887
BECAUSE I MISJUDGED
A LITTLE BIT IN THE BEGINNING,

596
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,931
YOU KNOW, WHAT I WAS SEEING,
SO YEAH, MORE UNCOMFORTABLE.

597
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,025
>> Jeff: WELL, BASED
ON WHAT'S BEEN SAID TONIGHT,

598
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,152
I COULDN'T EVEN GUESS
WHO I THINK IS GOING HOME.

599
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,154
SO LET'S END THE SUSPENSE
AND GET TO THE VOTE

600
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,072
JILL, YOU HAVE
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.

601
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,408
I TAKE IT YOU'RE
KEEPING THAT FOR YOURSELF?

602
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:48,036
CANNOT VOTE FOR JILL.
EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.

603
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,370
IT'S TIME TO VOTE.

604
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,414
JILL, YOU'RE UP.

605
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,554
>> DON'T EVER FLUFF OFF
A SOUTHERN WOMAN.

606
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,599
I AIN'T NO SITTING DUCK, HONEY.

607
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:27,075
>> YOU'RE THE BLACK WIDOW,
KING COBRA AND BLACK MAMBA

608
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,743
ALL ROLLED INTO ONE.

609
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:30,286
YOU MAY NOT BE
GOING HOME TONIGHT,

610
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,122
BUT THE LINES HAVE BEEN DRAWN.

611
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:48,638
>> Jeff: I'LL GO
TALLY THE VOTES.

612
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,899
IF ANYBODY HAS
A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL

613
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:03,903
AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

614
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,749
ALL RIGHT, ONCE THE VOTES
ARE READ, THE DECISION IS FINAL.

615
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,626
THE PERSON VOTED OUT
WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE

616
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,336
THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.

617
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,380
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

618
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,635
FIRST VOTE...

MARTY HAS THREE VOTES;
KELLY B. HAS THREE VOTES.

632
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,916
>> Jeff: WE HAVE A TIE.

633
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,502
MARTY HAS THREE VOTES;
KELLY B. HAS THREE VOTES.

634
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:43,294
HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

635
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,213
MARTY, KELLY B.,
YOU WILL NOT VOTE.

636
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,423
EVERYBODY ELSE WILL VOTE,

637
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:50,551
AND YOU'RE VOTING
FOR MARTY OR KELLY B.

638
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,053
JANE, COME GET THE URN.

639
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,097
YOU'RE UP FIRST.

640
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,297
>> Jeff: I'LL GO

00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,186
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

642

SIXTH PERSON VOTED
OUT OF<i> SURVIVOR: NICARAGUA...</i>

650
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,805
KELLY B.
THAT'S FOUR, THAT'S ENOUGH.

651
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,850
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

652
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,317
KELLY B., THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

653
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,365
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

654
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:39,410
(\THUNDER RUMBLING\)

655
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,673
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT,
HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

656
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,843
YOU ARE NOW GOING TO LISTEN IN
ON THE TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ESPADA

657
00:34:55,927 --> 00:35:00,181
WHILE YOU FEAST
ON CHICKEN AND BEEF KEBOBS.

658
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,225
GO AHEAD AND MOVE ACROSS.

659
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,189
>> GOING INTO TONIGHT,
I WAS PRETTY SURE

660
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,818
THAT THERE WAS CONSENSUS
ON THE TRIBE THAT WE WERE,

661
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,028
YOU KNOW, GOING TO KEEP
THE YOUNG PEOPLE TOGETHER,

662
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:16,030
AND SO TO BE SINGLED OUT,
FOR WHATEVER REASON,

663
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,698
YOU KNOW,
I JUST NEVER GOT A VIBE

664
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,200
THAT, LIKE,
I DID SOMETHING WRONG.

665
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:22,203
I MEAN, I'M SURPRISED
BY THE DECISION TONIGHT.

666
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:29,710
>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
ESPADA FOR THEIR TRIBAL COUNCIL.

667
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:45,393
LA FLOR JUST FINISHED
THEIR TRIBAL COUNCIL.

668
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,394
THEY VOTED OUT KELLY B.

669
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,522
THEY'RE NOW GOING
TO ENJOY A MEAL

670
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,941
WHILE THEY LISTEN IN
ON YOUR TRIBAL.

671
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,985
LA FLOR, START EATING.

672
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:05,037
>> Jeff: CHASE,
HARD TO WATCH THAT?

673
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,291
>> IT'S VERY HARD TO WATCH THAT.

674
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:11,085
>> Jeff: NAONKA,
YOU'RE NOT EVEN LOOKING.

675
00:36:11,168 --> 00:36:12,378
>> I CAN'T LOOK.

676
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:14,505
I DON'T WANT TO HURT MYSELF
BY LOOKING OVER THERE.

677
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,258
>> Jeff: HOW IS IT, FABIO?

678
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:20,303
>> (\LAUGHING\):
SO GOOD, MAN, SO GOOD.

679
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:23,389
>> YOU WOULD ASK HIM, HUH?

680
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:25,308
>> Jeff: HOLLY,
TOUGH TO SIT HERE

681
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:26,392
HAVING TO VOTE SOMEBODY OUT

682
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:29,812
WHILE WATCHING
ANOTHER TRIBE FEAST?

683
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,272
>> IT'S VERY HARD.

684
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,774
I'D HAVE RATHER GIVEN UP
MY INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY

685
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,444
FOR THE TRIBE TO BE SITTING
OVER THERE TONIGHT.

686
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,487
>> Jeff:
DAN, YOU CAN HEAR THE ICE CUBES

687
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,656
PLUNKING IN THE GLASSES.

688
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,992
>> IF IT'S NOT A MARTINI,
IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME.

689
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:45,244
(\LAUGHTER\)

690
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,787
>> Jeff: WHAT DOES BOTHER YOU?

691
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,122
>> NOTHING.

692
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:50,333
IF THINGS BOTHERED ME,
I WOULDN'T BE HERE.

693
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,084
>> Jeff:
GETTING VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME,

694
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,794
WILL THAT BOTHER YOU
IF IT HAPPENS?

695
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,504
>> THAT WOULD BOTHER ME, YES.

696
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,966
>> Jeff: SO, YVE, WHY WOULD
HE SAY NOTHING BOTHERS HIM?

697
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,801
>> BECAUSE THAT
WAS THE ANSWER HE GAVE YOU.

698
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,844
BUT WHEN YOU HEAR HIM
AROUND CAMP

699
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:06,265
CONSTANTLY COMPLAINING
ABOUT THE RAIN, THE COLD--

700
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,976
EVERY DAY
SOMETHING IS AGITATING HIM

701
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:13,814
TO THE BRINK
OF ALMOST NOT WANTING TO STAY.

702
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,983
>> Jeff: DAN, HAVE YOU WANTED
TO QUIT THIS GAME?

703
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,485
>> NO. I MEAN, THERE ARE TIMES
WHEN I DO COMPLAIN.

704
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,863
YOU KNOW, I'M OUT THERE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

705
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:23,157
WITH THE FIRE--
THAT'S NOT ENJOYABLE.

706
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,575
SO, UH, SURE I SAY THINGS.

707
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:28,412
>> BUT IT'S JUST CONSISTENT,
AND WE NEED MORE POSITIVE ENERGY

708
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:32,875
AND COMMITMENT 100% OF THE TIME.

709
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,961
>> Jeff: BENRY,
IS IT A FAIR STATEMENT

710
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:38,172
TO SAY THAT DAN IS
A LIABILITY AT CHALLENGES?

711
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:40,216
>> YEAH. I MEAN,
IT'S FAIR TO SAY.

712
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,509
THERE ARE DEFINITELY
SOME OF US ON THIS TRIBE

713
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,552
THAT ARE A LITTLE MORE PHYSICAL

714
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,472
AND DOING WELL
IN THESE CHALLENGES.

715
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,348
BUT I WOULDN'T SAY
HE'S INCOMPETENT,

716
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,725
YOU KNOW, BY ANY MEANS.

717
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,519
>> Jeff: DAN, IS IT FAIR TO SAY,

718
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:55,064
WHEN IT COMES TO CHALLENGES
YOU'RE A BIT OF A LIABILITY?

719
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:57,191
>> I WOULD SAY
CERTAIN CHALLENGES.

720
00:37:57,274 --> 00:37:57,858
BUT I'M STILL OUT THERE.

721
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,861
I'M DOING WHATEVER I HAVE TO DO.

722
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,738
>> Jeff: YVE,
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT LOGIC?

723
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,198
"I'LL GIVE YOU WHAT I HAVE.

724
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:06,742
SOMETIMES I CAN'T GIVE YOU
WHAT YOU NEED."

725
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,577
>> I GIVE WHAT I HAVE
100% OF THE TIME AS WELL,

726
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,414
BUT I DON'T FEEL
I'M A LIABILITY.

727
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,708
>> Jeff: DO YOU THINK
DANIEL'S A LIABILITY?

728
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,585
>> I DO. I MEAN,
I LOVE THE GUY, I DO, BUT...

729
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,713
>> REALLY SOUNDS IT.

730
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,549
THAT'S A HECK OF A WAY
OF SAYING YOU LOVE SOMEBODY.

731
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,051
>> Jeff: DO YOU FEEL
ANIMOSITY FROM YVE?

732
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,929
>> ABSOLUTELY. AND I THINK
THAT SHE FEELS TONIGHT

733
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,556
MIGHT NOT BE
A GOOD NIGHT FOR HER.

734
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,266
>> Jeff: FAIR STATEMENT, YVE...

735
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,559
>> FAIR STATEMENT,
FAIR STATEMENT. I DO.

736
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:35,229
I FEEL LIKE MY HEAD'S
ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.

737
00:38:35,312 --> 00:38:38,107
>> Jeff: DAN, TELL ME WHY
THEY SHOULD GET RID OF YVE.

738
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,443
>> WELL, I GUESS YOU COULD
HEAR IT IN YVE'S VOICE.

739
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:41,610
SHE'S PRETTY ARROGANT.

740
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:45,364
>> ARROGANT?
WHAT ABOUT ME'S ARROGANT?

741
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,033
I DON'T TALK ABOUT MY FERRARIS

742
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,701
AND MY SIX CARS
AND MY THREE HOMES.

743
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,911
>> I DO.
>> I KNOW.

744
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,747
BUT WHAT ABOUT ME IS ARROGANT?

745
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:57,418
>> IT'S JUST YOUR OVERALL...
JUST YOUR OVERALL ATTITUDE.

746
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,420
>> Jeff: ALINA,
IS IT A FAIR STATEMENT

747
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,630
TO SAY THAT IT APPEARS TO BE
DAN OR YVE THAT'S GOING HOME?

748
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:05,217
>> YEAH. I MEAN, IT'S BEEN
GOING AROUND CAMP ALL DAY,

749
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:08,929
DO WE WANT TO KEEP SOMEBODY
WHO MAY BE A LIABILITY FOR US

750
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:12,099
BUT ISN'T GOING TO BE SOMEBODY
WHO'S A SUPER COMPETITOR,

751
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,770
OR DO WE WANT TO KEEP SOMEBODY
WHO IS PLAYING REALLY HARD

752
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:19,940
AND JUST MAKES
MORE COMPETITION FOR YOU?

753
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,485
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT,
IT IS TIME TO GET TO THE VOTE,

754
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:25,529
WHICH MEANS, LA FLOR,
IT'S TIME FOR YOU GUYS TO GO.

755
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,128
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, HOLLY,
YOU HAVE INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.

756
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,963
I ASSUME YOU'RE KEEPING THAT
FOR YOURSELF.

757
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:43,964
>> YES.

758
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,299
>> Jeff: YOU CANNOT VOTE
FOR HOLLY.

759
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:46,592
ANYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.

760
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,094
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

761
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,096
DAN, YOU'RE UP.

762
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,651
>> WHAT CAN I SAY, DAN?

763
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:04,610
LOOKS LIKE
IT'S EITHER ME OR YOU,

764
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:07,613
AND I'D MUCH RATHER IT BE YOU.

765
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,977
>> Jeff: I'LL GO
TALLY THE VOTES.

766
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,653
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,
THE DECISION IS FINAL.

767
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:50,531
THE PERSON VOTED OUT
WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE

768
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,366
THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
IMMEDIATELY.

769
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:54,368
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

770
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,789
FIRST VOTE: YVE.

771
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,796
DAN. ONE VOTE YVE;
ONE VOTE DAN.

772
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:12,386
YVE. THAT'S TWO VOTES YVE;
ONE VOTE DAN.

773
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:17,725
YVE. THAT'S THREE VOTES YVE;
ONE VOTE DAN.

774
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:23,981
SEVENTH PERSON VOTED OUT
OF<i> SURVIVOR: NICARAGUA...</i>

775
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,733
YVE. THAT'S FOUR.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

776
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,736
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

777
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,247
YVE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

778
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,249
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

779
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,554
WELL, BASED ON TONIGHT'S VOTE,

780
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,265
IT WOULD SEEM
THIS IS ONE UNIFIED TRIBE.

781
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,393
BASED ON WHAT I HEARD,
NOT SO SURE.

782
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:05,397
GRAB YOUR TORCHES,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP. GOOD NIGHT.

783
00:42:15,532 --> 00:42:18,035
>> Jeff: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

784
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:24,500
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON<i> SURVIVOR.</i>
>> WHY DON'T I GO UP TO MARTY

785
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,793
AND TELL HIM,
"GIVE ME THE IDOL."

786
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,753
>> Jeff: SASH REVEALS
A CRAFTY SIDE.

787
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,171
>> YOU HAND THE IDOL OVER.

788
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,798
>> Jeff: JANE REVEALS
A SNEAKY SIDE.

789
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,341
>> I WANT ME A FISH.

790
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,134
I'M NOT GONNA TAKE HIM
BACK TO CAMP.

791
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,135
BON APPETIT.

792
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,428
>> Jeff: AND FABIO REVEALS...

793
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,973
FABIO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
RIGHT NOW?

794
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,432
...TOO MUCH INFORMATION.

795
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:43,435
>> I'M USING THE RESTROOM.
>> Jeff: IN THE POOL?

796
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,275
>> IT'S FRUSTRATING TO BE
OUT OF THIS GAME AT THIS POINT.

797
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,859
DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF.

798
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,486
IT'S NOT WHAT I CAME HERE TO DO.

799
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:53,529
DID I INTEND TO WIN?

800
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,990
THAT WAS MY GOAL,
BUT I CERTAINLY DIDN'T HAVE

801
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,701
ANY ANTICIPATION OF GOING OUT
SO EARLY IN THE GAME.

802
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,953
I DO THINK IT WAS A MISTAKE
TO LET ME GO.

803
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:01,662
PERHAPS THEY HAVE REASONS
FOR LETTING ME GO

804
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:02,705
THAT I'M CLEARLY NOT AWARE OF.
