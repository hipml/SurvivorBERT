>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:04,754
<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,339
When the two tribes first hit

4
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:07,841
the beach, they stayed true to

5
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:08,842
their nature.

6
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,510
The Heroes were heroic, and the

7
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:11,261
Villains were villainous.

8
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:16,141
The Heroes overcame injuries...

9
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:17,183
>> PROBST: ...to win the first

10
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,184
challenge.

11
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,519
They also tirelessly worked

12
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:20,979
together to build a great camp.

13
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:23,565
>> Watching these guys working

14
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:24,941
together-- it's good to be a

15
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:25,942
Hero.

16
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:26,943
>> Villains!

17
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:27,944
>> Get your evil on.

18
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:29,612
>> PROBST: The Villains did not

19
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,572
work together and complained

20
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,699
about everything.

21
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,662
>> PROBST: It was the perfect

22
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:38,705
environment for Russell to work

23
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:39,706
his black magic.

24
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:40,749
Russell made deals with anyone

25
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:41,708
who would listen and even roped

26
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,835
in Parvati.

27
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,590
>> PROBST: But by day two, the

28
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:50,258
game started to change.

29
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,092
At the Heroes' camp, J.T.

30
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,720
embraced the dark side by

31
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:54,846
making conflicting deals with

32
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,973
James and Tom.

33
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:00,477
>> You're my guy for the end.

34
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,311
>> All right, you got me.

35
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,312
>> PROBST: At the Villains'

36
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,313
camp, Boston Rob behaved

37
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,106
heroically.

38
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,357
He worked hard around camp and

39
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,442
even built a fire without

40
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:10,445
flint.

41
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:11,154
And after getting sick and

42
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,782
passing out, he got up and

43
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:14,949
led his tribe to a

44
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,326
come-from-behind victory at the

45
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,702
immunity challenge.

46
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:18,912
Villains win the second

47
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,330
immunity challenge in a row!

48
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,831
After their second defeat in a

49
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:22,332
row, the Heroes were

50
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,584
demoralized, and James lashed

51
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:25,585
out.

52
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:26,586
>> He was telling you what to

53
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:27,754
do, and everybody mouth want to

54
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:28,755
talk.

55
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:29,923
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

56
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,299
James continued his tirade.

57
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,342
>> You're trying to blame this

58
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,384
entire challenge on me?

59
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,762
>> PROBST: And J.T.'s duplicity

60
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,138
was revealed when he chose not

61
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,140
to honor his alliance with Tom

62
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,391
by voting out Tom's closest

63
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,060
ally, Stephenie.

64
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,061
Steph, the tribe has spoken.

65
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,062
18 are left.

66
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:47,190
Who will be voted out tonight?

67
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,579
(squeaking)

68
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:11,965
>> There's a lot of frustration,

69
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:12,966
James.

70
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,008
I get that.

71
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,677
You could have been gentler,

72
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,636
that's all.

73
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,513
Let's do what we can to get it

74
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:19,556
back on track, you know?

75
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,515
>> I can't believe...

76
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:21,516
>> I think we cleared up a lot

77
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,559
of things.

78
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,518
>> Yeah.

79
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,602
>> We aired things that needed

80
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,396
to be said. Um...

81
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,856
>> Let's work together, man.

82
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:28,481
>> That's all I want to do, man.

83
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,399
>> Right.

84
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,276
We got a good fire going.

85
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,278
>> I love that.

86
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,280
It's nice to come home to fire.

87
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,615
>> At Tribal Council tonight, I

88
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,242
mean, just a nasty turn with...

89
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,202
All right, Steph's going, and

90
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,412
then, James got to bring down,

91
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:46,165
you know, just nasty, brutish

92
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,334
bullying on her.

93
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,794
The vibe now is, everybody comes

94
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,297
home, puts on a happy face, and,

95
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,674
uh, tries to make it as pleasant

96
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,467
as possible to be together.

97
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,345
(indistinct chatter)

98
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,140
>> I respect you a lot, Tom.

99
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,558
Here's the thing, man.

100
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,434
I'm sorry for-for everything.

101
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:10,315
I-I knew...

102
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,442
>> Right.

103
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,279
>> Hey, listen, sometimes with

104
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,322
numbers, that's the way the

105
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,323
dice come up.

106
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,324
I'm a big boy.

107
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,325
I'm okay with that.

108
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,284
>> Hey, I'm sorry, man.

109
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,285
>> Nope, it's all good.

110
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,328
It's all good.

111
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,329
>> I'll do my best.

112
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,663
>> I feel betrayed by J.T., but

113
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:26,289
if he really does feel bad about

114
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,917
it, um, he might be the guy to

115
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,335
keep me alive a little longer

116
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,879
and buy me some extra time if I

117
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,964
need it.

118
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,474
>> Right.

119
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,683
It's hard to play nice after a

120
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,851
scene like that, but that's

121
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,895
exactly what we need to do.

122
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:49,312
Right?

123
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,355
>> Yeah.

124
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,315
>> To be fair, the game has been

125
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,818
ugly, so maybe we were naive to

126
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,403
think we were coming back, and

127
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,906
it was going to be Marquis of

128
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,449
Queensberry rules here and

129
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,992
everybody fighting fair, and...

130
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,410
>> Right.

131
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,204
>> So, we know the guys that are

132
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,664
playing the game, and, uh, be

133
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,832
smarter.

134
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,875
>> Yeah.

135
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,252
>> Be smarter.

136
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,515
>> Okay, hold it, hold it.

137
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,142
I'm going to try to get in here.

138
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,143
I don't know what...

139
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,103
>> Ugh!

140
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,145
Oh, it hurts!

141
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,730
>> Ow! Ow!

142
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:33,690
This sucks.

143
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,691
>> Oh.

144
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,025
>> Is he moving again?

145
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,026
>> Yeah.

146
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,277
>> Does your head stay on his

147
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,612
chest, or does it roll off?

148
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,613
(laughter)

149
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,490
Mine just rolls right off.

150
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:43,491
It won't stay.

151
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,492
Ew!

152
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:48,746
(laughter)

153
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,747
Stop it!

154
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,875
(laughter continues)

155
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,924
(laughter)

156
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,678
>> Ew!

157
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,387
>> I mean, at the end of the

158
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,472
day, I wanted to see what would

159
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,516
develop, and you notice

160
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,852
different things around camp.

161
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,145
I mean, the clearest sign...

162
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:12,770
For anybody that's going to play

163
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,480
<i>Survivor</i> in the future, I'm

164
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,149
going to give you the key to

165
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,151
figuring out who's on what team.

166
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,485
Watch how they sleep at night.

167
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,529
Whoever's sleeping next to who--

168
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,698
and I'm even guilty of it-- will

169
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,658
tell you who's aligned with who.

170
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,243
Because at night when you go to

171
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:28,661
sleep, you don't usually go to

172
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,579
sleep next to the guy who you

173
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,372
want to vote off.

174
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,373
>> All right.

175
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,334
Sorry.

176
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,460
>> It's okay.

177
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,503
>> I don't trust Russell's ass

178
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,422
at all.

179
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,923
At all.

180
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,759
I mean, he's running around with

181
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,136
puppy doggy eyes over Parvati

182
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:45,762
since the minute we landed here.

183
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:46,554
He won't do anything without

184
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,513
her.

185
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,891
He has to sleep next to her

186
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,100
every night.

187
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,935
Coach and Jerri are trying to do

188
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:53,895
the same thing.

189
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,521
That can be dangerous.

190
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,024
I know. I've been there.

191
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,484
And I know how powerful that

192
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:18,503
kind of an alliance is.

193
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,379
>> Our tribe has not been solid

194
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:20,922
since we've been together.

195
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,465
That's why I was kind of hoping

196
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,842
for a rainy day that would force

197
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:25,468
us all in the shelter, all day

198
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,678
today, and play games and talk

199
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,596
and do some bonding stuff and do

200
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,641
some empowerment stuff.

201
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,643
>> This is the coop, huh? Sweet!

202
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,645
>> If we don't become a good,

203
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,563
cohesive team, we will continue

204
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,232
to lose.

205
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,275
>> Get them inside.

206
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:45,488
(clucking)

207
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,990
>> They got out.

208
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,951
>> Hell, yeah!

209
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:50,576
Free chickies!

210
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,788
>> Oh, my gosh.

211
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,040
>> That's him right there.

212
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,875
>> Get him out of there.

213
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,876
>> Oh, they're right there,

214
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,919
y'all.

215
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:00,962
Let's just grab them.

216
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:01,963
>> Grab 'em, bro.

217
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:02,964
(loud clucking)

218
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,507
>> Okay, there's one of them.

219
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,508
>> Hold him.

220
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,885
>> I don't even see the other

221
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,931
one.

222
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:12,932
>> Oh, there he is.

223
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:13,933
>> There he is! There he is!

224
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:14,934
There he is!

225
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:15,935
>> Grab him!

226
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:16,978
>> Hang on. Don't...

227
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:17,937
Don't get him running.

228
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,980
Don't get him running.

229
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,273
>> He is now wanted, dead or

230
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,440
alive, so it's his choice.

231
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,025
>> He just went out that way,

232
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,570
that way, that way.

233
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:26,571
What?

234
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,572
>> There he goes.

235
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,573
He's under the shelter.

236
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,824
>> Surround the shelter and

237
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:30,908
let's do the same thing.

238
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:31,701
>> He's coming out the back.

239
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,702
>> That's good. Yeah.

240
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,704
>> Good.

241
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:38,124
>> Good, good, good, Tom, very,

242
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,083
very good...

243
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,126
(whooping)

244
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,085
>> Still got it!

245
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,170
>> Good job, Tom!

246
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,462
>> It was a neat experience,

247
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,132
wrangling the chickens as a

248
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,466
tribe.

249
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:53,973
Um, that's what we need.

250
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:54,765
>> So in that sense, the

251
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:55,600
chickens getting out was

252
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:56,475
supposed to happen to help us

253
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,602
bond.

254
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,232
(Rupert snorts)

255
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:05,902
>> They're not going to kill

256
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:06,569
that thing so fast.

257
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,821
>> I can't believe that thing is

258
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,657
just sitting there, dude.

259
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,409
>> So, what's up, man?

260
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:13,993
>> The first vote is the most

261
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:14,744
important vote.

262
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,703
>> Right.

263
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:16,746
>> You got to be careful.

264
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,290
That's what I wanted to talk to

265
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,291
you about.

266
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,292
You got to be careful, 'cause

267
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,335
people want to have any excuse

268
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,336
to not be the vote.

269
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,337
What is that excuse?

270
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,296
"Oh, Russell and Parvati are

271
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,297
together."

272
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,298
>> Right.

273
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,299
>> Whatever it is...

274
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,300
>> Right.

275
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,343
>> Everybody's going to use an

276
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,385
excuse so it's not them.

277
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,762
Russell, um, is walking on very

278
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,013
thin ice.

279
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,431
Parvati, in my opinion, is the

280
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:37,516
most dangerous player on our

281
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:37,725
tribe.

282
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,727
>> And it's not that we're cool

283
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,729
or nothing-- me and Parvati.

284
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,731
It's because, uh, she's a good

285
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:44,732
asset to the team.

286
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,234
>> For him to be following

287
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,110
around Parvati is no strategy

288
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,779
at all.

289
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:50,988
It's puppy love.

290
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,114
She's got the charm.

291
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,366
She's got the smile.

292
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:53,950
For some reason, when she pays

293
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,743
attention to you, you feel like

294
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:56,702
you light up.

295
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,162
It's not that people don't see

296
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,121
it.

297
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,498
It's just that they are allured

298
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,624
by her charm, and they're taken

299
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:01,832
by it.

300
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:02,625
They're smitten by it.

301
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,711
It's unbelievable.

302
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:09,632
>> What's the deal?

303
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,801
>> Uh...

304
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,636
>> About what?

305
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,637
>> Who can kind of...

306
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,638
>> Uh, ultimately, I'm trying

307
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,598
to get a feel on Russell on what

308
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,599
he's thinking about Parvati,

309
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,642
and..

310
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,643
>> And not for nothing, but

311
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,895
I've seen this go down before.

312
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,314
You got to be careful, you know,

313
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:25,940
the way you're hanging out with

314
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:26,607
her and everything.

315
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,608
>> Yeah, I know.

316
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,609
>> And I mean, she might... she

317
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,652
might not be the strongest, and

318
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,446
she got a lot of friends on the

319
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,406
other side.

320
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,448
>> Right.

321
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,408
>> And we see you marching

322
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,325
around with her, so...

323
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,285
>> Yeah.

324
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,202
>> ...you have to understand

325
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,245
our concern.

326
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,204
>> Oh, I understand it.

327
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,122
>> Am I right, or am I right?

328
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:41,914
>> Yeah, you're totally right,

329
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:42,748
and it's like it's ostracizing

330
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:43,749
you.

331
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:44,792
>> Right.

332
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:45,334
>> And you got to be cool on

333
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:45,793
that, man.

334
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,713
>> Man.

335
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,797
>> I mean, what else can you do?

336
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,798
>> You've got to do it.

337
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:51,799
I have no choice.

338
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:52,800
That would be my... the end of

339
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:53,801
my game...

340
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,846
Everybody knows Coach is a big

341
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,223
joke, so he can go around

342
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,766
flapping his jaws all he wants.

343
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,768
The thing with Rob-- he thinks

344
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,437
he's the boss of the camp, like

345
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,396
that's my daddy.

346
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,773
Well, I'm the daddy around here.

347
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,192
But I got to listen to this fool

348
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:10,735
like he's in control.

349
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,820
But that's what I have to do to

350
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:13,946
get to the top.

351
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,989
That's what I'm going to have

352
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:15,990
to do until he's gone.

353
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:16,949
He don't know who he's messing

354
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:17,992
with.

355
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:18,993
Nobody knows who they're

356
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,286
messing with around here.

357
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,245
It's Russell Hantz.

358
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,498
Give me a break!

359
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,636
>> And he's, like, "No, no.

360
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,637
She'll know something's coming.

361
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:39,597
man.

362
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,639
Just keep doing what you're

363
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:41,682
doing, brother."

364
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,642
"Keep doing what you're

365
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:43,893
doing."

366
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,644
>> Wow.

367
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,062
>> He is after you.

368
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,646
>> He is demented.

369
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,230
>> I didn't want your name to

370
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,774
even be on the block.

371
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:50,733
It worries me because of that,

372
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,276
so I was... I was even trying to

373
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:52,902
convince him...

374
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:53,903
>> I'm used to it, honestly.

375
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:54,904
>> I was even trying to convince

376
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:55,905
him another way.

377
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:56,947
>> I've dodged a few bullets.

378
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:57,948
Why do they always want to vote

379
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:58,908
me out?

380
00:10:58,991 --> 00:10:59,950
I don't know.

381
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:00,993
I'm just a sweet, innocent,

382
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,329
little girl, really.

383
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,289
(laughs)

384
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,290
>> And then Rob came over there

385
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,291
and said, "Give us your word

386
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,250
you'll get rid of her."

387
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:08,876
I said, "Dude, do you seriously

388
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,711
think I'm here to hook up with

389
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:11,712
a girl?

390
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:12,713
I mean, please."

391
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:13,756
>> I made an alliance really

392
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,549
early on with Russell, and so, I

393
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,550
don't know what I'm going to

394
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,551
have to do, but who else am I

395
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,552
going to be with right now

396
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,639
besides Russell?

397
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,015
I don't trust anyone, and I

398
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:23,974
actually do trust him, even

399
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,059
though he's kind of a lunatic.

400
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,560
>> I said I'll show you how to

401
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,728
get rid of her, and we'll get

402
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,105
rid of her-- and then y'all can

403
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,815
trust me then, so she's gone.

404
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,442
Okay?

405
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,527
And that's it.

406
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,444
(Parvati laughs)

407
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:35,986
>> If I'm gone, you're gone

408
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,530
next.

409
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:38,280
>> Yeah.

410
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,073
>> You know that.

411
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:53,629
>> Yeah. Bye.

412
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:54,839
>> So I'm three days out,

413
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,715
basically, from the, you know,

414
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,175
95 degrees, hot as hell, started

415
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:58,884
throwing up.

416
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,094
My gums were, like, bleeding a

417
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:00,970
little bit.

418
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,179
I mean, I started getting these

419
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,389
big sores on my face.

420
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,515
I'm, like, all right, what's

421
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,224
this?

422
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,267
>> Is this the same story as

423
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,059
last night?

424
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,060
>> Not the same story, my

425
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:08,769
friend.

426
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,146
>> It's not? It's awful similar.

427
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,272
>> No, it's not, trust me.

428
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:11,981
>> Okay.

429
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,524
>> So it took me eight days to

430
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,776
get from, uh... de Los

431
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,026
Angeles...

432
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,737
Yeah, I had my compass set on,

433
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,531
uh, east-due-east, and I was

434
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,241
hoping I would make it. So...

435
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,576
>> (chuckles): Rob thinks he's

436
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,160
running the show, and Coach

437
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,370
thinks he's running the show.

438
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,496
But I'm gonna take control of

439
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,622
that.

440
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,665
They want to play rough?

441
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,667
I can play rough.

442
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,210
King Rustall can get rid of the

443
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,253
machete.

444
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,255
You know what happens then?

445
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:36,881
Getting rid of the machete will

446
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:40,259
cause conflict in this camp.

447
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,719
Rob's going to go crazy.

448
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,095
The tribe's going to go crazy.

449
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,221
Everything's going to go

450
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:44,930
haywire.

451
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,474
Can't find the machete, can't

452
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,016
eat the chickens, can't open

453
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:51,812
the coconuts, can't start fire.

454
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,606
And that's a good thing.

455
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,316
>> 95 degrees, hot as hell, and

456
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,692
I was thinking to myself, what

457
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:57,067
am I going to do?

458
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:57,860
I've got no water.

459
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:58,903
>> This is going to be

460
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,029
wonderful, 'cause it's not just

461
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,072
going to be the machete.

462
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,741
Old Boston Rob likes that hat,

463
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:04,533
don't he?

464
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,202
I think he will go nuts without

465
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:06,869
his little "B" hat.

466
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,954
I don't even like the Boston

467
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:09,955
Red Sox.

468
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,374
It's the Houston Astros, baby.

469
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:26,013
>> COACH: ♪ Oh... ♪

470
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:30,017
>> ♪ I...

471
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:36,524
Give you...

472
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:51,664
All of my strength. ♪

473
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:52,081
>> Who wants clam?

474
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,626
Russell, Rob, Parvati?

475
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,835
Nobody?

476
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:57,378
>> I'm fine without a clam

477
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,003
right now.

478
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,839
>> Courtney?

479
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,007
'Cause I don't want it to spoil

480
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,259
'cause it's out of the water

481
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,635
and I don't want it to... you

482
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:05,970
know, go to waste, and I don't

483
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,263
want to eat it all, either.

484
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,806
>> Well, just eat a little bit

485
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,975
of it and throw it away.

486
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:15,729
>> All right.

487
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,856
>> Machete?

488
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,949
>> Damn.

489
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,959
I did find one giant clam that

490
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,919
was good for five or six bites

491
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,921
of food, but nobody cared.

492
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,756
You know, I'm used to seeing on

493
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,049
<i>Survivor</i> where somebody brings

494
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,760
a fish in this size, and the

495
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,429
entire tribe swarms him hoping

496
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,681
to get an ounce of meat, and you

497
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,725
eat what you can eat when you

498
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,226
can get it and you don't ask

499
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,352
questions, 'cause you don't

500
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:55,978
know where your next food is

501
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,939
coming from.

502
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:03,444
>> Randy, this thing cuts good.

503
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,945
>> Ew.

504
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:05,279
>> Got to eat.

505
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:08,699
You don't like it?

506
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,576
>> You want a white piece?

507
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,577
Of this?

508
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,578
(Parvati spits)

509
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:13,579
>> Sorry.

510
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,622
>> No?

511
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,457
>> I can't eat it.

512
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,541
It makes me gag.

513
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,917
>> No, we're not gonna waste

514
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:19,209
this on you.

515
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,420
>> Mm-mm, don't do it.

516
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,630
>> We won't.

517
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,089
(laughter)

518
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,382
>><i> Survivor,</i> in so many ways,

519
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,425
is like the real world--

520
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,969
you don't get ahead by being

521
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,138
smart...

522
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,307
clever, hardworking.

523
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,016
You get ahead, unfortunately,

524
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,018
with a pretty smile and being

525
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,188
able to schmooze people.

526
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,191
And Parvati is the queen.

527
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,860
You know, this whole game is

528
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:46,654
designed to mess with

529
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,822
everybody's nerves, and it

530
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:49,698
works.

531
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,492
>> The team's only as good as

532
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,076
its weakest player.

533
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,828
And that's why we never get

534
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,246
anything done around camp.

535
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,414
Because the weakest players

536
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,624
just sit there and think that

537
00:15:58,707 --> 00:15:59,208
they can look pretty and cute

538
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,125
and have everything handed to

539
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,126
them. Right?

540
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,338
>> Well... let's vote them out.

541
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,131
>> I personally can't stand it

542
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,299
when I see people that are

543
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,175
loafers and people that are

544
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,718
weak.

545
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:10,844
It's not fair.

546
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,596
It's just simply unjust.

547
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,391
And it's selfish, and it's

548
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,518
egotistical that "I can do

549
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,229
nothing, sit back, feed me

550
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,773
grapes like a Greek goddess."

551
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,400
It's just... the whole thing

552
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:37,246
just stinks.

553
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,415
>> You know, I think you're a

554
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:43,627
great player, and, um... I'd

555
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,211
like to make it to the end.

556
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,254
>> Yeah, I do, too.

557
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,548
>> But if somebody's not

558
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,173
talking to me strategy, they're

559
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,174
talking to somebody else.

560
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,884
>> Mm-hmm.

561
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:51,844
>> And when you come talking

562
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:52,428
with somebody on the day we're

563
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,887
going to Tribal Council, that

564
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:54,221
doesn't count.

565
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,180
You know what I mean?

566
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,224
'Cause you need a favor then.

567
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,183
>> Candice is beginning to

568
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,184
scare me a lot.

569
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,145
She's much more strategical

570
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,104
than I gave her credit for to

571
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,398
begin with.

572
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,858
>> I think Cirie is trustworthy

573
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,818
if... she feels safe within...

574
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:08,277
>> If she feels safe.

575
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,279
Candice may be the next one

576
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,071
to go, in my opinion, but, you

577
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,365
know, it's not all up to me.

578
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,617
Not in this group.

579
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,118
>> What are your thoughts?

580
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,162
Everything still good?

581
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,413
>> It's hard to trust anyone

582
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,497
out here right now.

583
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:29,131
>> Mm. Tell me about it.

584
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,133
(laughs)

585
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,134
>> Okay.

586
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,093
>> I got her.

587
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,636
I can get rid of her. (laughs)

588
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,263
I can tell a story when I need

589
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,139
to.

590
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,349
I think my lying ability is...

591
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,559
probably better than it should

592
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,852
be.

593
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,145
Considering I don't do it very

594
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,480
much in everyday life, I'm

595
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,356
pretty good at it out here.

596
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,777
(water splashing)

597
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,069
>> I'm-I'm nervous now.

598
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:51,403
>> About what?

599
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,197
>> About us.

600
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,281
>> You're nervous about me and

601
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:54,448
you?

602
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,074
>> Yeah.

603
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,076
>> Why? What...

604
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,202
>> I hear-hear stuff.

605
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,120
>> Tell me what you hear.

606
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,163
>> That you don't trust me,

607
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,206
and...

608
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,123
>> Who said that?

609
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,167
(Cirie laughs)

610
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,919
>> I don't want to say who said

611
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:07,377
it-- I just want to...

612
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,295
>> Well, it doesn't matter who

613
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,589
said it, 'cause it's not true.

614
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:11,173
I'm thinking, where did that

615
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,217
come from, because I have never

616
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,219
said that.

617
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,429
Either somebody is trying to

618
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,556
make sure that she and I don't

619
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,309
trust each other, or I'm

620
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,519
thinking there's something

621
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,479
weird going on.

622
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,481
Did you tell Cirie in any way

623
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,067
that... I said or that I don't

624
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,109
trust her?

625
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,694
>> Absolutely not.

626
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,445
>> Okay.

627
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,614
She's hearing around that I

628
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,074
said I don't trust her.

629
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,158
>> I've never heard you talk

630
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,409
bad about Cirie.

631
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,537
>> No, and I haven't.

632
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,249
Cirie just told me that

633
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,418
somebody is telling her that I

634
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,545
said I don't trust her.

635
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,963
>> I don't have any idea what

636
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:51,797
you're talking about.

637
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,173
I just wish you would just chill

638
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,342
out just for a second, just for

639
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,635
a little while, and then we'd be

640
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:57,594
all right.

641
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,638
Candice, I mean, she's a nut.

642
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:00,889
Everybody's going to play with

643
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:01,932
Candice 'cause she's hustling

644
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,933
a little bit too much.

645
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:03,976
I don't know what's wrong with

646
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:04,393
the girl.

647
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,811
Like, I don't even care about

648
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,312
the whole... we can't even focus

649
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,647
on all that stuff right now.

650
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,648
It's pointless to even worry

651
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:10,566
about all that.

652
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,650

00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,065
Should be an interesting

951
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,066
afternoon.

952
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,109
Grab your stuff.

953
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,110
Head back to camp.

954
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:55,196
I will see you at Tribal.

955
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,473
(laughter)

956
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:22,766
>> Oh, dude.

957
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:23,767
Feel your hair.

958
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:24,768
>> Dude, come on!

959
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,311
>> Oh, my God, it's a lot of

960
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,313
mud.

961
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,314
>> Yeah, those Heroes were

962
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:31,399
waiting to wallop on us a bit.

963
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:31,941
I guess they must have all

964
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,110
eaten steroid sandwiches right

965
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,696
before the, uh... the challenge.

966
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,032
They were all crazy-eyed, and,

967
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,950
uh, it was almost scary to look

968
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,202
in their faces.

969
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,704
Not that it was intimidating,

970
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,873
but I worried for their sanity.

971
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:47,874
>> There you go.

972
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:48,875
>> A mess.

973
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:49,918
Everyone's a mess.

974
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:50,877
>> Little pigpen.

975
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,879
From the, uh... the Muppets?

976
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,005
>> The Peanuts.

977
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,048
>> Peanuts.

978
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,341
>> You don't even have to be

979
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:57,342
told that your name is on the

980
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,385
block.

981
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,427
You can just sense it.

982
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,887
I'm the oldest guy in the game,

983
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,055
I'm the oldest guy in this

984
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,723
tribe, and Russell and Boston

985
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,642
Rob and probably Tyson are

986
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:06,935
falling for the oldest trick in

987
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:10,688
the book since cave man days

988
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,440
that these girls can get what

989
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,192
they want if they bat their

990
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,569
eyes and flirt.

991
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:17,570
>> Scrubbing is involved.

992
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,613
>> Yeah.

993
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:19,823
>> Parvati is a threat right

994
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,033
now, even though she may be in

995
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:25,161
a minority in this tribe.

996
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:25,829
But if we overlook her because

997
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,248
she's got a pretty smile and a

998
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:28,832
nice wiggle, she's going to be

999
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,584
trouble when she meets up with

1000
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,877
her old friends James, Cirie

1001
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,796
and Amanda.

1002
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,048
And we could all pay dearly for

1003
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,633
not taking care of business

1004
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:39,634
right now, and by taking care

1005
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:40,844
of business, I mean getting her

1006
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:44,889
out of here as soon as possible.

1007
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,309
>> No, I'm...

1008
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,310
I have not made my bet yet.

1009
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,311
>> Answer the question.

1010
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,439
>> I have not made my bet yet.

1011
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,191
>> I hardly ever even talk

1012
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,234
strategy.

1013
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,026
The only person I talk strategy

1014
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,027
with is Randy, because he's a

1015
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:58,987
a super fan.

1016
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,821
>> Oh, Coach, please.

1017
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:00,363
Every time I see you, you're

1018
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,614
running around grabbing someone,

1019
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,740
trying to talk to them.

1020
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:03,700
>> That is not true.

1021
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:04,242
That is totally not true.

1022
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:04,784
That is not true.

1023
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:05,785
I don't lie.

1024
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,037
You know, Parvati came at me

1025
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:08,621
real aggressive in the water

1026
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:09,873
today saying, "You know, are you

1027
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:10,915
targeting me?"

1028
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,584
I kept trying to fend off her

1029
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,335
question, and yet she thinks

1030
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,712
that she can bat her eyelashes

1031
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:16,296
and wiggle her hips and roll

1032
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:19,716
down a very short bathing suit

1033
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,300
already to make it even more

1034
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:20,884
skimpy, and everybody will

1035
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:21,885
follow her around.

1036
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:22,886
Well, maybe Russell will, maybe

1037
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:23,887
other people will.

1038
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:24,888
Maybe Tyson will.

1039
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:25,889
I sure as hell won't.

1040
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,724
>> I don't want to go, and I

1041
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:28,600
don't think I'm the weakest.

1042
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:29,601
I think I would be a poor choice

1043
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:30,602
to go.

1044
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:31,603
I think you could use me to your

1045
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:32,604
advantage.

1046
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:33,521
>> That stuff doesn't work on

1047
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,522
me.

1048
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,523
I've been coaching college

1049
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,441
soccer for women for 13 years,

1050
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,442
and I've never had one of those

1051
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:38,485
girls bat their eyes at me and

1052
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:39,444
make a difference in their

1053
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,779
playing time.

1054
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,451
>> Never.

1055
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,452
Fear's never controlled me,

1056
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:48,453
and flirting has never

1057
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,454
controlled me.

1058
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:50,455
I'm my own man.

1059
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,456
>> Really?

1060
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:52,457
>> I'm going to make my

1061
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,458
decision...

1062
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,459
>> I just want you to know.

1063
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,460
I don't think any flirting

1064
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:56,461
controls anyone.

1065
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,462
>> But I do like flirting with

1066
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,505
you.

1067
00:29:58,588 --> 00:29:59,464
>> I think it's ridiculous that

1068
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,465
people think that.

1069
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,508
>> So out here with a million

1070
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:02,759
dollars on the line, certainly

1071
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:03,718
isn't going to happen.

1072
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:04,761
And anybody that lets it happen

1073
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:05,929
will be a fool.

1074
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,931
>> Parvati has too many friends

1075
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,099
on the other side, and they're

1076
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,476
controlling that game over

1077
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,519
there.

1078
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,437
Randy has no friends anywhere,

1079
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:14,896
here or there.

1080
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,856
She's dangerous.

1081
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,191
Randy is not dangerous.

1082
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,442
What do you think?

1083
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,485
>> Amanda, come here.

1084
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,486
Are you hearing this?

1085
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,445
>> I heard him.

1086
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,488
It has to be a group effort.

1087
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:24,447
It can't be two or three

1088
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,448
going...

1089
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,449
You know what I'm saying?

1090
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,450
>> I know.

1091
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,451
>> Like, it has to be the

1092
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:29,452
majority, and what is the

1093
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,453
majority?

1094
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,454
Randy is weak.

1095
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,497
Why would we want to weaken our

1096
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,456
tribe?

1097
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,457
>> I just know she has a ton of

1098
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,500
friends over there.

1099
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:36,459
>> I'd rather take Randy out

1100
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,460
than Parvati.

1101
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:38,461
>> So, let's make a decision.

1102
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,922
People are coming.

1103
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,048
>> Parvati is like a virus.

1104
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,967
That girl needs to go.

1105
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,802
She has a way of just, like,

1106
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,095
roping people in, even when they

1107
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,054
don't want anything to do with

1108
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:51,349
her.

1109
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,100
I'm going to find out how to

1110
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:55,019
bottle that up and use it in my

1111
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,938
real life, 'cause it's pretty

1112
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,816
powerful stuff.

1113
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:00,775
>> I'm safe tonight.

1114
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:01,818
You're safe tonight.

1115
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:02,902
We know the two people whose

1116
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,779
names are there, um, and I don't

1117
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:05,113
know what to do.

1118
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,072
You know?

1119
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:08,616
I don't know where you're at.

1120
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,867
>> I'm going to tell you like

1121
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:10,868
this.

1122
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:11,286
I'm not in trouble.

1123
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:11,911
>> I don't want to, either.

1124
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:12,912
>> Therefore, I don't need...

1125
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:13,913
>> I feel the same way.

1126
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,039
>> All I'm going to do is,

1127
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,916
where's everybody at?

1128
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,375
Boom, that's it, done.

1129
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,419
That's it.

1130
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:20,753
If they all want him out, that's

1131
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:21,129
who I'll write.

1132
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,088
If they all want her out, that's

1133
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,131
who I'll write.

1134
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,050
That's it.

1135
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,051
Let me go do this thing.

1136
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,721
>> Okay.

1137
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,144
>> It doesn't matter, either.

1138
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,145
It's just a matter...

1139
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,146
He's, obviously, the weakest

1140
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,731
link, so...

1141
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:40,732
>> Yeah. I mean, this is a lot

1142
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:41,774
of...

1143
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:42,775
>> We don't have to play that

1144
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:43,735
card, but a lot of people want

1145
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:44,736
to, and that's... it's

1146
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:45,737
overall just...

1147
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,738
>> I know, but I'm just going

1148
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:47,739
to say it again because...

1149
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:48,740
Everyone...

1150
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:49,782
I think everyone has their own

1151
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:50,742
strength...

1152
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:51,743
>> Yeah, but if we vote him out

1153
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:52,744
tonight, they'll have to sit out

1154
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:53,745
one of their strong guys in the

1155
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:54,746
next challenge, so that will

1156
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:55,747
give us a fighting chance.

1157
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,748
>> I mean, we don't know.

1158
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:57,749
>> Yeah, you don't know.

1159
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:58,750
>> Yeah.

1160
00:31:58,833 --> 00:31:59,792
>> I'm just saying that

1161
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:02,420
that's...

1162
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,797
>> Well, if you're going to say

1163
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:05,423
not Randy, then you have to say

1164
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,174
someone else?

1165
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,593
>> I don't have to say.

1166
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,178
>> Why not?

1167
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,179
>> Because I don't know.

1168
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,221
I'm just trying to figure out

1169
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,222
what's going on.

1170
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,223
>> Well, but if you're trying to

1171
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,475
get someone to vote for someone,

1172
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:16,559
you have to say who.

1173
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:17,518
>> I'm not trying to get anybody

1174
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,645
to vote for anybody yet.

1175
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:19,687
I don't know what's going on,

1176
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,647
honestly.

1177
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,689
Moments like that drive me up

1178
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,274
the wall.

1179
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,651
That girl-- she thinks that she

1180
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,319
can make people do whatever she

1181
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,571
wants, and people are, but I'm

1182
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,697
not.

1183
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,698
I am not.

1184
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,283
I'm at the point right now,

1185
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,201
where every time I'm around

1186
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,994
here, I just want to punch her

1187
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:35,286
in the face.

1188
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,996
That's all I can think about is

1189
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,122
just taking her down.

1190
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,124
Boy, I'll tell you what.

1191
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,167
>> Jerri's annoying.

1192
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,337
(laughs)

1193
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,630
I mean, she is the fakest

1194
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,674
Fakey McGee I've ever met.

1195
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:48,883
I know she's running around

1196
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:50,218
behind my back talking about me.

1197
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,969
She's just, like, a bitter old

1198
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,221
cougar, and I think her days are

1199
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,806
numbered, too.

1200
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:55,848
>> I loved it when I saw

1201
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,225
Stephenie gone, 'cause that

1202
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,227
should make it clear to you

1203
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,436
what's going on.

1204
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,771
It should make it clear to Rob

1205
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:02,814
what's going on.

1206
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:03,856
If you guys don't see that,

1207
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:07,318
you're next.

1208
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,695
I don't have a clue what you

1209
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:09,654
were talking to Parvati about,

1210
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,239
and I don't even want to know.

1211
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,075
But... this is Micronesia 2.0.

1212
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,076
>> Oh, it is.

1213
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,954
>> And if you guys don't see

1214
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:18,579
that, I don't want to play the

1215
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,123
game with you anymore, I really

1216
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,499
don't.

1217
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,167
I'm not going to scramble today

1218
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,377
like a dead man walking,

1219
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,294
because...

1220
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,921
>> No, I'm gonna be scrambling.

1221
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:27,505
>> Because if I am dead man

1222
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:30,508
walking... (laughs)

1223
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,677
a lot of my friends are next.

1224
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,721
And, you know, I'll see you in

1225
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,096
Loser's Lodge.

1226
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:38,182
I'll buy you a beer.

1227
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,059
>> There's nobody out here

1228
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,477
that's honorable.

1229
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,979
There's nobody out here that's

1230
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,356
honorable... anymore.

1231
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,649
Except for me.

1232
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,233
I hate to pontificate about

1233
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,235
that but, you know, Martin

1234
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:53,239
Luther King says that the

1235
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,157
greatest measure of a man is

1236
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,661
not in the way he handles times

1237
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,122
of comfort, but in the way he

1238
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,291
rises with controversy and

1239
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,668
challenge.

1240
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:06,169
There's always hope.

1241
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:09,130
The last thing we have in life

1242
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,090
or in this game is hope that

1243
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,801
the impossible happens, that we

1244
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,094
dare to dream, that Randy's

1245
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,888
going to wake up in this camp

1246
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:17,847
tomorrow.

1247
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,431
So yes, there's still hope.

1248
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,349
While I still have a breath and

1249
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,142
a brain cell in my brain, I

1250
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:24,896
will fight for him.

1251
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:46,667
>> PROBST: Behind each of you

1252
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:47,668
is a torch.

1253
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:48,878
Go ahead and grab one.

1254
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:51,214
Dip it in and get fire.

1255
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,758
This is part of the ritual of

1256
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,218
Tribal Council, because in this

1257
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,719
game fire represents your life.

1258
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:57,345
As long as you have fire,

1259
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,347
you're still in the game.

1260
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,848
When your fire is gone, so are

1261
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:04,435
you.

1262
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,144
Sandra, when you play a game

1263
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,396
like this with 20 people who

1264
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,314
have all played-- some two,

1265
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:11,108
some three times-- how big a

1266
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,944
consideration is past

1267
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,237
relationships, whether within

1268
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,322
this tribe or people that are

1269
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,198
on the other tribe?

1270
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,574
>> There's a lot of things we

1271
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:19,951
take into consideration.

1272
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,536
One, who's won before.

1273
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,246
Who's been out here three times.

1274
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,622
Who has friends on another

1275
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:25,373
tribe.

1276
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,166
For instance, with Parvati,

1277
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,960
we're thinking, okay, Cirie's

1278
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,169
over there, James is over

1279
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,838
there, Amanda's over there.

1280
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,756
Like, how far do we want them

1281
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,883
to go, and then, once we merge,

1282
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,635
are we screwed?

1283
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:38,928
>> PROBST: Parvati, you're

1284
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:39,720
shaking your head.

1285
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,930
>> Yeah, everyone's nervous

1286
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:41,514
about me flipping if a merge

1287
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,181
comes.

1288
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,308
All I can say is that I want to

1289
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,519
stick true to this tribe.

1290
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:47,854
But, you know, it's words, and

1291
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:48,479
in this game, your word doesn't

1292
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,189
mean that much.

1293
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,274
It's really your actions that

1294
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,733
matter.

1295
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,110
>> PROBST: Russell, what kind

1296
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,486
of weight do you give that?

1297
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,071
>> I think it is a huge

1298
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:58,948
advantage that somebody might

1299
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,825
know three or four people on

1300
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:01,868
the other tribe.

1301
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,537
It's a huge advantage.

1302
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,621
>> PROBST: Jerri, do you think

1303
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:06,914
tonight's vote should be based

1304
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,875
on performances at challenges?

1305
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,251
>> I think the physical side of

1306
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,628
this is very important for us.

1307
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:13,337
This is our first loss, and we

1308
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,298
don't want to lose any more.

1309
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,049
But I know myself I'm still

1310
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:17,592
taking into account all the

1311
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,677
other factors, relationships

1312
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,345
and all that sort of thing.

1313
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,388
>> PROBST: So for you, past

1314
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:23,973
relationships, whether within

1315
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,182
your own tribe or the other

1316
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,517
tribe, is a big factor?

1317
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,226
>> I think it should be a big

1318
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,730
factor for everyone.

1319
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:31,772
>> PROBST: Sandra, is there a

1320
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:32,899
leader on this tribe?

1321
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,483
>> Well, it all depends on what

1322
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:34,775
we're doing.

1323
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,401
If we're building the shelter,

1324
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,862
we start listening to him, and

1325
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:38,446
then when it gets too much,

1326
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,656
then we go off on our own.

1327
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,240
And then Coach'll delegate,

1328
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,326
"You do this and I'll do this

1329
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,744
and we'll go do that," but then

1330
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,078
when you look, Coach is gone

1331
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,371
two miles out.

1332
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,624
>> Sandra, you only mentioned

1333
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,083
me in that, and I don't know if

1334
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,877
it's a jibe at me, but that's a

1335
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,836
bunch of bull.

1336
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,462
I collected firewood for three

1337
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,714
hours, thank you very much.

1338
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:57,924
Nobody's out there collecting

1339
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:58,799
firewood like I am.

1340
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,383
I've been working hard around

1341
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,302
camp, and I resent you for

1342
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:01,594
saying that.

1343
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,429
In fact, why do you think we

1344
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,347
have the worst shelter in

1345
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:04,805
<i>Survivor</i> history?

1346
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,641
Because it's like herding cats.

1347
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,184
>> It's not the worst shelter

1348
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,310
in<i> Survivor</i> history-- I was in

1349
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,478
that one, actually.

1350
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,520
>> I'd argue that I was

1351
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,563
also a part of one of those

1352
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,689
contenders.

1353
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:14,941
>> I want to say one other

1354
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:15,775
thing to Sandra.

1355
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,026
If you think I'm not pulling my

1356
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,235
weight around camp and in the

1357
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,070
challenges, then put my name

1358
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,154
down on the paper tonight.

1359
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:21,364
>> No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1360
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:22,448
That's not what I'm saying.

1361
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:23,074
>> Well, that's what you made it

1362
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:23,908
sound like.

1363
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,076
You made it sound like I'm an

1364
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:25,660
ass that sits there that wants

1365
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,328
to be a leader and then doesn't

1366
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,371
do any work.

1367
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,289
>> And we ain't got a machete!

1368
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,999
We haven't had a machete all

1369
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,000
day.

1370
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,085
>> PROBST: What do you mean, you

1371
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:34,460
have no machete?

1372
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,837
>> It grew legs and walked off.

1373
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:37,880
(Probst laughs)

1374
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:38,839
>> We have three chickens,

1375
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,633
though.

1376
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:41,717
>> PROBST: Parvati, you guys

1377
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:42,468
are literally laughing about

1378
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:45,554
how bad it is at camp.

1379
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:46,514
>> We're kind of a tribe full

1380
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,641
of misfits, Jeff.

1381
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,268
We're the Villains.

1382
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,477
>> Russell, what are you making

1383
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,604
of this tribe you're on?

1384
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,523
>> It's definitely different.

1385
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,024
The dodos I played with last

1386
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,526
time couldn't hold a candle to

1387
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,402
any one of these players.

1388
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,278
>> Mm...

1389
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,239
>> So it's fun, but it's a lot

1390
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,615
harder, because you have

1391
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,576
everybody playing the game.

1392
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,786
But that's what I like, and

1393
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,246
that's what I want to see, and

1394
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:13,124
that's what I respect.

1395
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,667
>> PROBST: Rob, given how well

1396
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,751
you guys have done overall at

1397
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,586
the challenges so far, I'm a

1398
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,255
little surprised at the lack of

1399
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,382
cohesiveness within the group.

1400
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,591
Do you think just coming to

1401
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,676
Tribal Council alone will

1402
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,761
impact that when you guys go

1403
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:26,804
back to camp?

1404
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:29,223
>> No. I don't think so.

1405
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:30,808
I think that when we have a

1406
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:31,475
challenge, we know what we have

1407
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,145
to do, and we figure out a way

1408
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,855
very quickly on how to

1409
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:36,605
accomplish it.

1410
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,858
At camp, it's a different story.

1411
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,276
There's nobody to tell us, "You

1412
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:40,818
need to make your shelter

1413
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,486
better," or "You need to

1414
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,446
collect firewood."

1415
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,447
There's not that sense of

1416
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,406
urgency.

1417
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:49,368
So I don't think it will change.

1418
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,995
>> PROBST: All right, it is

1419
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:51,704
time to vote.

1420
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:53,622
Russell, you're up.

1421
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,596
>> It was either you or me

1422
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:09,472
tonight, and I wasn't gonna go

1423
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,599
down without a fight.

1424
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:45,925
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1425
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:48,052
votes.

1426
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,851
Once the votes are read, the

1427
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:56,769
decision is final.

1428
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,270
Person voted out will be asked

1429
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,772
to leave the Tribal Council

1430
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:00,898
area immediately.

1431
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,025
I'll read the votes.

1432
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:06,570
First vote...

00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:11,867
Randy.

1434
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:12,451
Rob.

1435
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:16,747
One vote Rob.

1436
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:17,581
Randy.

1437
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:21,001
Two votes Randy, one vote Rob.

1438

Randy.

1439
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,631
That's three votes Randy, one

1440
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:29,510
vote Rob.

1441
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,469
Randy.

1442
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:35,683
Four votes Randy, one vote Rob.

Randy.

1444
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,727
