00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,877
>> JEFF PROBST: Last week, 20

2
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:04,254
seasons of<i> Survivor</i> led up to

3
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:05,213
our most epic battle yet.

4
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:07,757
Rob Mariano, one of the game's

5
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,509
ultimate strategists, and also

6
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:10,635
one of the biggest double

7
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,637
dealers, had recreated himself

8
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:13,471
as a hero.

9
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,181
>> A lot has happened with me

10
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,766
personally in my life in the

11
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,017
six years since I've played

12
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:18,393
this game.

13
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:19,102
I'm learning compromise and

14
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,603
patience.

15
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:21,521
>> PROBST: He led his tribe of

16
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:22,772
Villains by being a straight

17
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:23,273
shooter and working hard.

18
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,232
>> I'm in awe of Rob.

19
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,150
You are the man.

20
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,067
And it's like, when you talk,

21
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,652
I'm literally hanging on

22
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:27,944
every word.

23
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:28,945
>> I appreciate it.

24
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:29,571
>> PROBST: Because of his

25
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:30,238
efforts, the tribe flourished.

26
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,991
Rob jumps down on the final

27
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:33,616
piece!

28
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,994
Villains win immunity!

29
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,996
But he made an enemy of Russell.

30
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:38,496
>> Watch your back, man.

31
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,206
>> Yeah, well, same thing for

32
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:40,957
you, man.

33
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,499
>> PROBST: Who used lies,

34
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,877
intimidation and chaos to

35
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,545
further his own self-interest.

36
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,380
>> I'm that good, where I can

37
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,673
bring people together in this

38
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,926
game for my good.

39
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,219
>> PROBST: So Rob's leadership

40
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,220
was short-lived.

41
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,973
>> My idea of trust and loyalty

42
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:57,515
is different from Russell's.

43
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,058
>> PROBST: Motivated by

44
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,894
jealousy, Russell used his

45
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:01,394
power of persuasion and

46
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,313
gathered enough votes to

47
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,607
eliminate his adversary.

48
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,066
Rob.

49
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,693
The loss of Rob has given the

50
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,653
Heroes a chance at a comeback.

51
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,030
Now, they're down only two

52
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:12,405
members.

53
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,031
(shrieks happily)

54
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,157
And they've even discovered a

55
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,658
clue to a hidden immunity idol.

56
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,743
>> We're going to look for it

57
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:17,285
together.

58
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,077
>> PROBST: But the bigger

59
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,412
question: how will losing

60
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,206
Rob's leadership and challenge

61
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,165
dominance impact the Villain

62
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,249
tribe?

63
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,335
>> The waters are so muddy

64
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,085
right now.

65
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:26,669
I mean, we were in the best

66
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,962
position possible.

67
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,547
>> PROBST: Coach, Courtney and

68
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,800
Sandra refused to vote for Rob,

69
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:32,342
and now they're trapped in a

70
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,803
tribe controlled by Russell,

71
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,221
whose ego may have just put the

72
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,806
Villains in a hole they can't

73
00:01:37,889 --> 00:02:01,246
get out of.

74
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,247
(laughs)

75
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,874
>> Boston Rob was after me.

76
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:05,708
You know what?

77
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:06,709
I just won.

78
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,379
Big-time Boston Rob, the super

79
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,213
All-Star-- he ain't nothing on

80
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,589
me.

81
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,216
>> It's, like, game on now, huh?

82
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,926
>> I'm controlling this game.

83
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:15,552
I'll take care of all of them,

84
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,928
one at a time.

85
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,263
This is Russell Hantz.

86
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,139
If you ain't with me, you're

87
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:24,769
against me.

88
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:25,728
>> It's fun.

89
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,604
>> So much fun.

90
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,772
>> I only like doing it to

91
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:28,606
people that deserve it.

92
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,232
>> Me, too.

93
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,233
(women laughing)

94
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,943
>> I did not want Boston Rob

95
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:32,318
out.

96
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,820
We screwed up the whole tribe.

97
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,405
Ridiculous that they're cowards

98
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,573
and they want to vote out

99
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,491
Boston Rob, because Russell is a

100
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,409
bully.

101
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,618
No more, no less.

102
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:44,622
He's a bully.

103
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,623
>> I mean, I didn't want to

104
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,249
vote off Rob this early, either.

105
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,876
I really didn't.

106
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:48,751
And the more I thought about

107
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,419
it, the more I was really upset

108
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,838
about it.

109
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,965
I miss him already.

110
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,720
>> I wasn't quick to get rid of

111
00:02:58,803 --> 00:02:58,887
him.

112
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,681
What are you talking about?

113
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,348
>> I feel like Jerri made a big

114
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,517
mistake in aligning with

115
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,226
Russell.

116
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,145
Now I'm forced to go that

117
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,229
direction, and I feel at this

118
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,857
point that it's an alliance

119
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,984
based on lies.

120
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,113
Are we going to the final five

121
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:17,697
with them or are we going to

122
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,365
try to make a play?

123
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,037
>> I say we just see what

124
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,372
happens at the merge.

125
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:26,915
>> The Villains are in the

126
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,041
crapper.

127
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,083
I don't think we'll win another

128
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:29,792
challenge.

129
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,127
We're done.

130
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,462
We're toast.

131
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,214
Pray for the merge.

132
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,842
(theme song playing)

133
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:41,447
>> Beautiful.

134
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,365
How high up do you want

135
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,074
to go?

136
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,158
>> I say we bring it up pretty

137
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,284
high.

138
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,245
>> Where's J.T.?

139
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,330
>> I don't know.

140
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,416
>> The Hero tribe has plans to

141
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,500
look for the hidden immunity

142
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:56,170
idol as a group, but the best

143
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,380
thing for me is to make sure I

144
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,631
know where it's at.

145
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,675
This is<i> Survivor,</i> and you

146
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:01,634
don't know what these other

147
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,720
people are thinking around here.

148
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,388
The clue said that the idol's

149
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,265
in the creek or something.

150
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,058
So I'm just going to swing by

151
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,185
there and take a gander.

152
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,669
Perfect.

153
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,879
I'm going to get the hell out

154
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,006
of here while I still can.

155
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,267
>> You just found it now?

156
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,060
Oh, my God.

157
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:52,852
>> Let's get out of here.

158
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:53,561
Immediately after I found it, I

159
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,313
was like, you know what?

160
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:55,938
I better get out of here, 'cause

161
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,690
I wasn't sure if I was going to

162
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,941
tell anyone.

163
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,276
And before I could even move,

164
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,611
Amanda walked up, so I was like,

165
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,738
well, I'll show her.

166
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:06,908
>> You found it?

167
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,159
>> I just found it.

168
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:08,701
Then, immediately, Candice

169
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,535
walked up, so I was like, you

170
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,412
know what, if I come clean, our

171
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,207
tribe will come together.

172
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:14,832
No one is going to vote me out,

173
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,667
because I have it.

174
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,757
>> Right behind that tree.

175
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,925
(laughs)

176
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:24,592
I walked up, back up my alone

177
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,052
walk...

178
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:26,469
>> Yeah.

179
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:26,803
>> Five minutes.

180
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,054
>> Can I see it?

181
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:28,846
>> Yeah.

182
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,306
The first one of us that needs

183
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:31,766
this after the merge, we'll use

184
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:32,391
it.

185
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,267
>> It's a beautiful thing.

186
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:33,643
>> Yep.

187
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,268
>> And we're taking them down

188
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,061
with it.

189
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:35,895
>> Nice.

190
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:36,229
>> Beautiful.

191
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,563
>> Colby!

192
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,273
>> Sweet!

193
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,485
Nice work, brother.

194
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,780
>> You want some coconut?

195
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,907
>> I'm good.

196
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:54,497
>> Good thing you walked up.

197
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,624
How close was that?

198
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,462
J.T. found the hidden immunity

199
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,382
idol, which is not so great in

200
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,633
my book, because J.T. is the

201
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,970
slimiest guy out here.

202
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,847
He's running the tribe.

203
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,515
He's got a little best friend

204
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,100
interest with everybody.

205
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:14,684
And every vote, he's been the

206
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,685
one that's going back and forth,

207
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,562
and everybody's coming to him,

208
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,521
trying to figure out which way

209
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,065
is J.T. going to go.

210
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,693
And nobody calls him out.

211
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,403
I'm afraid to ever say anything

212
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,905
about J.T., because he's, like,

213
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,991
the golden boy, you know.

214
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,033
He's always right about

215
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,034
everything.

216
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,286
Like, he's always in with

217
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,912
everybody.

218
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,622
>> Yeah.

219
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,917
>> Right?

220
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,211
Isn't he in with you?

221
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,046
>> Is he in with you?

222
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,257
>> Isn't he in with Rupert?

223
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,594
Isn't he in with Colby?

224
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,430
>> It would be in Amanda's best

225
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,639
interest to work with me to get

226
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,641
rid of him and the idol or get

227
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,310
rid of the idol.

228
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:57,727
Either way.

229
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,688
J.T.'s dangerous.

230
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,001
>> I know.

231
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,923
>> We're all going to die.

232
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:27,965
>> No, we're not.

233
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:28,382
>> Yeah, we will.

234
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,175
>> No, we won't.

235
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:29,759
>> You can't not eat for that

236
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,093
long.

237
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,136
>> Yeah, you can.

238
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,054
It's unbelievable.

239
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,388
We're literally starving out

240
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:34,764
here.

241
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,598
And I'm worried.

242
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,182
I mean, people are shutting

243
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:36,766
down, and you can see it.

244
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,683
I mean, we're already on our

245
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,269
heels 'cause we're losing.

246
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,979
The time for exigency has

247
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,231
exited.

248
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,400
It is do-or-die out here.

249
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,277
>> "Now for a challenge that's

250
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,988
good clean fun-- no oil, no mud,

251
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:51,614
no brawling.

252
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,200
It's not who strikes first but

253
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:54,700
who strikes the most.

254
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,661
Your best meal yet is calling."

255
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,121
>> It sounds like an individual

256
00:08:59,205 --> 00:08:59,455
type thing.

257
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:01,707
>> Yeah, it does.

258
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,625
>> Yeah, I mean, it doesn't say

259
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,627
anything about tribe.

260
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,753
"Your best meal yet is calling."

261
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,548
Sounds like a merge to me.

262
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,715
Today, the Villains are all

263
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,883
hoping that it's a merge.

264
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:11,592
It's a challenge of good, clean

265
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,512
fun, and our best meal yet is

266
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,264
calling, so I'm happy about

267
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:16,889
that.

268
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:17,765
I think we should take it.

269
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:18,307
>> I think we should take

270
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,225
everything.

271
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,184
>> Just in case we don't come

272
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,519
back.

273
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:22,687
I'm hoping and praying that it's

274
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,063
a merge.

275
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,064
And we don't know where

276
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,232
we're going to end up, so we

277
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,316
definitely want to get all of

278
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,776
our stuff together and take the

279
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:29,652
tools, the tarp, all of our

280
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,154
belongings, because we could

281
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:43,582
end up somewhere else.

282
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,794
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

283
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:50,256
>> Oh... my God!

284
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:50,881
>> Wow!

285
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,842
>> Oh, look, pizza, guys.

286
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,260
>> Oh!

287
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,094
>> PROBST: Heroes getting your

288
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,387
first look at the new Villain

289
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,930
tribe.

290
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,348
Boston Rob voted out at the

291
00:09:59,432 --> 00:09:59,849
last Tribal Council.

292
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:00,725
>> Oh, my God.

293
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,434
>> Wow!

294
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,561
>> Wow!

295
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,772
>> Looks like we're, uh,

296
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,858
merging.

297
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,320
>> PROBST: So, Rupert, shocked

298
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,904
that Boston Rob is gone?

299
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,448
>> It sure looks like they got

300
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:15,865
a woman's alliance.

301
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,826
>> PROBST: Time will tell.

302
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,329
>> When I found out that the

303
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:21,871
Hero tribe thinks this is an

304
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,373
all-girl alliance, I thought

305
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,833
they're making a huge mistake,

306
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,209
because there's no girl

307
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,586
alliance over here.

308
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,421
Rob got voted out last night

309
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:30,755
because of me.

310
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,883
But now, if we merge, the Hero

311
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,217
tribe-- they'll let me know

312
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,385
whoever they're voting for if

313
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,428
they think I'm the one that

314
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:37,970
flop.

315
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,513
Why wouldn't I flop if I'm in

316
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,181
trouble?

317
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:40,806
Like... help.

318
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,059
(laughs)

319
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,268
>> PROBST: Villains, you

320
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,354
brought, clearly, your entire

321
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:46,687
camp.

322
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:47,813
Talk to me, Russell.

323
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,982
>> I'm sure everybody has the

324
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,359
merge in mind.

325
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,569
And if there is a merge, we're

326
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:55,071
prepared, they're not.

327
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:55,821
>> The first thought I had when

328
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,657
we saw them walk in with

329
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,951
toolbox in hand was, okay, go

330
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:01,452
back through your mind.

331
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:02,453
You read the same clue they

332
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:03,454
did, what did I not pick up

333
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,456
on?

334
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,957
>> PROBST: It's true, you have

335
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,877
survived 18 days out here.

336
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,211
No small feat.

337
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:10,878
You've survived

338
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:13,172
eight Tribal Councils.

339
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:13,881
Very tough to do.

340
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,133
And it does seem that you

341
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,551
deserve a bit of a break.

342
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,094
As you have all seen behind

343
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,261
you...

344
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,304
>> Yes!

345
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:20,930
>> PROBST: ...a very nice feast.

346
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,723
>> Oh, my God!

347
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:23,849
>> PROBST: You'll all have

348
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,518
an opportunity to

349
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,727
enjoy this feast.

350
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,020
>> Oh, my God.

351
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:28,896
>> Oh, wait. What?!

352
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,481
>> Wait a minute, wait a minute!

353
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:30,981
What's, what's the rub?

354
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:31,857
>> PROBST: Before we move any

355
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,652
further, let me answer the

356
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,738
question on everybody's mind.

357
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,907
Everybody drop

358
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,367
your...

359
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:41,742
>> Yeah!

360
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,828
>> PROBST: ...expectations.

361
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,287
(all groan)

362
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,914
>> Evil!

363
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,332
>> PROBST: We are not merging.

364
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:48,791
>> Wah-wah-wah. Mean.

365
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,209
>> Try and take it off.

366
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,544
>> PROBST: This is a reward

367
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:51,919
challenge.

368
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,671
Both tribes will have an

369
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:54,922
equal opportunity to win it.

370
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,466
You win it, you eat.

371
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,676
Losers go back to camp,

372
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,844
and if it is the Villains,

373
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:00,845
you will clearly be

374
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:01,971
putting your shelter back

375
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:02,596
together.

376
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,055
>> That's right.

377
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,515
>> PROBST: Here's how it works:

378
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,349
today's challenge, you're gonna

379
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,642
do a little<i> Survivor</i> bowling.

380
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:07,268
It's very simple.

381
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,144
You will square off

382

the numbers.

574
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:07,985
So, in our minds,

575
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,987
we're still catching up.

576
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:10,946
We don't want to

577
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:11,321
get overconfident.

578
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,532
We just want to keep it going.

579
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,533
>> This is good.

580
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,410
>> Oh, God, this is good.

581
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,078
>> I was not ready to merge yet.

582
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:18,954
>> No, not yet.

583
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:19,913
We need to knock

584
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,331
two more of them out.

585
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,374
>> How about Boston rob?

586
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,000
(Rupert laughs)

587
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:23,292
>> Crazy.

588
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,044
>> Insane voting him out!

589
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,171
>> It was a bold move.

590
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,214
>> It was a silly move.

591
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,382
>> The moment Boston Rob

592
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,717
left the game, I knew

593
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,301
the guys were not in control

594
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,135
because he was their

595
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,178
best competitor.

596
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,680
So it's obvious; there's an

597
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:37,306
all-woman's alliance over there.

598
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,099
>> The girls are gonna

599
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,184
expect you guys to jump

600
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,226
in their girl alliance, but

601
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:41,852
I know...

602
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:42,811
>> We would be the first

603
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:43,771
ones to find out who

604
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:44,480
they're voting for.

605
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,731
>> That's the whole thing.

606
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,316
>> Now Coach and Russell

607
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,942
are on the outs over there.

608
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,694
They're sitting ducks.

609
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:51,987
If we merge right now,

610
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,529
we've got them on our side

611
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,239
in a heartbeat, you know?

612
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,866
So right now, I think we stick

613
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:56,867
to our plan and just

614
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,785
keep dominating.

615
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,953
We're still losing.

616
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,538
We got 'em on the hills.

617
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,623
>> I love you all.

618
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,624
>> I love you, too.

619
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:04,583
>> It's a family, guys.

620
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,584
>> Hear, hear.

621
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,211
>> To the fantastic five.

622
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,482
>> Every single person on this

623
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,691
team is an idiot.

624
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,567
I just, I'm furious.

625
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,568
This whole stupid thing,

626
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,736
packing up the whole camp,

627
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,612
just assuming there was

628
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:34,988
gonna be a merge.

629
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,074
Are you kidding me?

630
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,158
You know, voting off Rob

631
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:38,534
was a big mistake.

632
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,201
He would have made sure

633
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,078
that Sandra and Courtney

634
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,371
did not sit out today, that

635
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,622
they played, and they we had

636
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:44,206
strong people in the immunity

637
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:55,676
challenge.

638
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,344
>> We already made that mistake

639
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,263
once and we just let it

640
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,055
happen again.

641
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:01,306
I looked at both of them

642
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,141
of them and I said, "You guys,

643
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:03,934
can you do this?"

644
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:04,768
And they're, like, "Um,

645
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,895
I don't know."

646
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,108
>> You said, you said, no,

647
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,110
you said, "I don't know."

648
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,486
>> It's, like, so now it's me

649
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,737
and Courtney's fault that you

650
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,697
guys lost?

651
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,781
>> No, no, it's not.

652
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:18,365
That's not what I'm saying.

653
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,576
I'm saying why did this stupid

654
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,869
mistake get made again that we

655
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,661
made the last time?

656
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,287
>> He's the one

657
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,371
that said Sandra and Courtney.

658
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,080
>> I know.

659
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:25,581
>> So then me and Courtney

660
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,332
are looking like, "Okay, so then

661
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,625
we'll both have to compete in

662
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,960
the immunity challenge.

663
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,044
That's a big mistake.

664
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,462
>> Yeah, I said the same thing,

665
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,631
but it was Coach.

666
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:35,632
You said, "I really want

667
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:35,883
pizza."

668
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,384
And I said, "We don't need

669
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,010
pizza.

670
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:38,802
We need an immunity.

671
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:39,678
>> We need to eat

672
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:40,929
and we need to win.

673
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:41,597
Sandra and Courtney.

674
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,222
Why are you

675
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:42,723
blaming me and Courtney?

676
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,182
>> I'm not blaming you

677
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:44,558
and Courtney.

678
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,225
>> Why? We didn't even

679
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:45,851
do anything.

680
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:46,894
>> All I'm saying is that

681
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,103
if even once, you guys

682
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:48,979
were like, "Hell, yeah,

683
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:49,938
"put me in there!

684
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:50,814
I want to go."

685
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:51,523
>> So, in essence,

686
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,108
the reason we lost today was

687
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,443
because he and Courtney sat out.

688
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,360
>> Again, no, that's not

689
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,112
what it has to do with, again.

690
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:57,988
>> I just don't understand.

691
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,323
The minute we get back to camp,

692
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,074
and you guys don't have a meal,

693
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:01,575
all of a sudden, it's me

694
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,784
and Courtney.

695
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,369
The worst tribe ever put

696
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,496
together is the Villains tribe.

697
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,165
I should not even be here.

698
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,541
I should be with the Heroes

699
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,169
'cause I can't stand Jerri.

700
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,880
I hate Coach, I hate Danielle.

701
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,632
I hate Russell even more.

702
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,925
So any of those--

703
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,384
I'm not going to pick one above

704
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,136
the other 'cause I equally hate

705
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:26,058
them all.

706
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:26,934
>> Tyson's gone,

707
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,518
Rob's gone, and now we're the

708
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,062
ones on the outs.

709
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,522
And it's 5-2.

710
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,526
Russell's the kind of

711
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,861
person where if he finds out

712
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:38,946
somebody's gunning for him,

713
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,240
he'll take them out.

714
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,366
if one of us is going next..

715
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,915
I'll be like, "Hey, Russell.

716
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,333
Coach wants you gone."

717
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,918
And I bet you Russell

718
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:53,961
will believe me and get

719
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:54,461
rid of Coach, and me and

720
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,630
Courtney will be saved again.

721
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,506
I'm going to work

722
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,091
my magic and we're both going

723
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:02,719
to be here on day 22 and day 23.

724
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:22,823
I didn't want to play

725
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,074
this game without Tyson.

726
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,492
I didn't want to play this

727
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:26,410
game without Boston Rob.

728
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,703
And it's like all that's

729
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,453
out the window.

730
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,122
>> I guess that maybe

731
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,289
you feel guilty or something,

732
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,958
but I know I'm the next one

733
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:33,667
to go.

734
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,627
And what else is there to say,

735
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,503
you know?

736
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,130
It's based on

737
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,381
Russell's idea of what he wants

738
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,675
his<i> Survivor</i> to be like, and

739
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,135
everyone's going along with it

740
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,594
out of, like, fear or something.

741
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,110
>> Yeah.

742
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,236
>> Oh.

743
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:01,903
>> But it don't

744
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:02,738
matter what she says.

745
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,073
I will tell them

746
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,450
this is how we're voting.

747
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,577
And that's how it's going to be.

748
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,663
That simple.

749
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,581
>> But at the same time, I heard

750
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,916
Coach was saying that he made a

751
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,251
mistake and he wished he could

752
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:17,294
go back.

753
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,336
>> What mistake?

754
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,838
>> Him letting Rob go home.

755
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,007
That he should have never made

756
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,258
the choice that he made, and

757
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:24,342
that he's sorry.

758
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,677
That's what he told her.

759
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,054
And that he wanted to get rid

760
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,096
of you.

761
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:28,597
So, I don't know about

762
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,766
your homeboy.

763
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,184
>> Oh, he ain't my homeboy.

764
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,852
I don't trust him.

765
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,187
Obviously, you can't trust him.

766
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,314
Because of that right there.

767
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,565
He's going behind my back,

768
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:39,858
saying stuff like that.

769
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,443
You know... you know, he's...

770
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,028
he's digging his own grave, just

771
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,030
like Rob did.

772
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:47,032
>> I told Russell that Coach was

773
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,575
talking about voting for him,

774
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,077
and Russell's so stupid, he ate

775
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,661
that crap up.

776
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,788
I'm telling you, he's like, "Oh,

777
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,164
my God, I can't trust him."

778
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:54,664
And the sooner he goes,

779
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:55,415
the better.

780
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,335
So, Russell, you don't know how

781
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,419
to play this game.

782
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,962
Yeah, he's done good so far,

783
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,256
but with me, he don't know what

784
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:08,553
he got himself into.

785
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,930
>> He's going to flip.

786
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,389
He's mad at me for getting rid

787
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,016
of Rob, and now he's trying to

788
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,517
stab me in the back.

789
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,894
>> Who does he think he is?

790
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,270
>> And you know the beautiful

791
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,522
thing about all this?

792
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,065
If he goes, there's one guy

793
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:20,649
left, and there's no doubt in

794
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,484
their minds what's going on.

795
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,610
>> That there's a girl alliance.

796
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,570
>> Once we merge, they ain't

797
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,571
going to talk to one of

798
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:26,822
the girls.

799
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,406
They're going to be scared to

800
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:28,990
death to, but they're surely

801
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,450
going to come straight to me.

802
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,701
>> Perfect.

803
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:32,911
>> Perfect.

804
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,246
>> It's all falling together

805
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,413
perfectly.

806
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,082
Mmm.

807
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:39,209
>> You've done that before.

808
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:53,473
(laughter)

809
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:56,518
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

810
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,823
>> PROBST: All right, you guys

811
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:10,866
ready to get to today's

812
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:11,867
immunity challenge?

813
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,784
>> Oh, yeah.

814
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:13,034
>> Yes.

815
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:13,618
>> PROBST: First things first.

816
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,829
Rupert?

817
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:19,416
Take back immunity.

818
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,334
Once again, immunity is back up

819
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,128
for grabs.

820
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,796
For today's challenge, you will

821
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,756
be belted together in pairs.

822
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,549
You'll race through the mud,

823
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,969
going under and over a series of

824
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:33,054
obstacles to retrieve a flag.

825
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,347
You'll then race back.

826
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,765
First pair back with their flag

827
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,559
scores a point for their tribe.

828
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,020
First tribe to score two points

829
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,563
wins immunity, is safe once

830
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,191
again from Tribal Council.

831
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,025
Losers, you know what's

832
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,026
happening.

833
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,194
Somebody voted out of

834
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,403
your tribe.

835
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:49,029
Because we have odd numbers, one

836
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,697
of the matchups will be a

837
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,407
one-on-one showdown.

838
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:52,866
Villains, you have two

839
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,367
extra members.

840
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,368
Courtney and Sandra sat out

841
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,036
last time.

842
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,495
That means you are in this time.

843
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:58,580
Who's going to sit out for

844
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,581
the Villains?

845
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,165
>> Why don't you and Danielle

846
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,833
sit out and I'll play.

847
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,043
>> PROBST: Jerri and Danielle

848
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:03,919
sitting out.

849
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:04,586
All right.

850
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,921
Sit-outs, take a spot over here.

851
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:06,838
Everybody else, I'll give you a

852
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:07,714
minute to strategize.

853
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:10,175
We'll get started.

854
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,637
All right, we have our

855
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,679
first matchup.

856
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,473
It's Russell and Sandra taking

857
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,433
on Amanda and Candice.

858
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:18,767
For immunity.

859
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,601
Survivors ready?

860
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,353
>> Here we go.

861
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,145
Here we go, team.

862
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,271
>> PROBST: Go!

863
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,272
>> Come on, Amanda!

864
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:24,940
Let's go, Candice!

865
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:25,732
>> PROBST: Amanda and Candice

866
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,108
under the obstacle first.

867
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,693
Russell and Sandra right behind.

868
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,612
Sandra slow through that

869
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,739
first obstacle.

870
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:33,907
Carrying a lot of mud, you

871
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,283
weigh a lot more.

872
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,826
Amanda and Candice over for

873
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,994
the Heroes.

874
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,204
We're neck and neck at the

875
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,580
second obstacle.

876
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,917
>> Down, down!

877
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,585
>> Dig, dig, dig!

878
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,837
>> Grab, grab, grab!

879
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:48,588
>> Let's go, let's go!

880
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,548
>> PROBST: Amanda and Candice

881
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,008
have the flag for the Heroes.

882
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,760
Russell and Sandra very slow

883
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,554
under that third obstacle.

884
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,390
Sandra really struggling.

885
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:01,268
>> Come on, Sandra!

886
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:01,851
>> PROBST: Amanda and Candice

887
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:02,727
taking their time.

888
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:03,812
No rush at all.

889
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,814
You can see the look on

890
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,107
Russell's face.

891
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,733
It says it all-- absolute

892
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:09,818
frustration-- as Amanda and

893
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,737
Candice continue further down

894
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,824
on the course.

895
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,826
>> Beautiful.

896
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,119
>> PROBST: Amanda and Candice

897
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,662
score for the Heroes.

898
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:24,416
Sandra is stuck.

899
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,418
Trying to back out of that

900
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,420
challenge now.

901
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,005
Heroes lead one-zip.

902
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:30,797
Time for a showdown.

903
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,674
Coach taking on Rupert

904
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,093
one-on-one.

905
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,679
Survivors ready?

906
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,055
Go!

907
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,724
>> Go, Dragon Slayer!

908
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:43,351
>> Go, Rupe!

909
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:43,852
>> PROBST: Both men go

910
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,812
head first.

911
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,022
Coach is out of the gate first

912
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,315
for the Villains.

913
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,150
Coach over the second obstacle

914
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,693
first for the Villains.

915
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,111
Coach flying through

916
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,321
this course.

917
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:54,738
>> That a way, Rupe!

918
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:55,822
>> PROBST: Rupert right on

919
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:56,698
his tail.

920
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,909
Rupert now picks up some ground.

921
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,871
Both men have their flags.

922
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,582
Rupert now in the lead for

923
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,917
the Heroes.

924
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,213
Rupert flies over that

925
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,798
second obstacle.

926
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,175
It's Rupert and Coach

927
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,301
neck and neck.

928
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:17,218
It's going to be a race to

929
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:21,264
the finish.

930
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,807
Coach wins for the Villains!

931
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:27,062
We are tied one-one.

932
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,980
All right, here we go.

933
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,357
The final round.

934
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:30,940
Parvati and Courtney taking on

935
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,859
J.T. and Colby.

936
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,110
For immunity.

937
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,195
Survivors ready?

938
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:35,945
Go!

939
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:36,780
>> Come on, you guys.

940
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:37,864
Let's go, Courtney.

941
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,075
J.T. and Colby dive head first.

942
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,327
Parvati and Courtney very slow

943
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,995
under that first obstacle.

944
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,205
>> Come on, you guys.

945
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,039
You guys, you got it!

946
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:46,873
>> Courtney, let's go!

947
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:47,749
Pick it up, girls!

948
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:48,625
Let's go!

949
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:49,459
>> PROBST: Courtney and Parvati

950
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:49,876
falling behind.

951
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,796
J.T. and Colby head first again.

952
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,130
>> Come on, you guys!

953
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,382
You got it!

954
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,299
>> PROBST: J.T. and Colby have

955
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,759
the flag.

956
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,344
They're heading back.

957
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,513
Parvati and Courtney are not

958
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,515
even at their flag yet.

959
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,683
Heroes are almost at the

960
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,228
end now.

961
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,651
This is not even close.

962
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:15,860
J.T. and Colby score for

963
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,154
the Heroes.

964
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,281
Heroes win immunity!

965
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,825
(cheering)

966
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,326
>> Yeah!

967
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,911
Nice work!

968
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,455
>> Oh, my God!

969
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:30,750
>> PROBST: You all right,

970
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:31,876
Courtney?

971
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,003
>> She hurt her ankle.

972
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,507
>> PROBST: See if you can make

973
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,425
it on your own.

974
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,342
If not, we'll get medical

975
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,844
in there.

976
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,848
Heroes, congratulations

977
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:48,059
once again.

978
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:50,478
No Tribal Council for

979
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,729
the Heroes.

980
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,106
The new five stays intact.

981
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:53,898
Villains, four straight

982
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,401
challenges in a row.

983
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,026
Another trip to Tribal Council.

984
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,902
Grab your stuff.

985
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:58,903
Head back to camp.

986
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,905
I'll see you tonight at Tribal.

987
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,991
>> I want Courtney gone.

988
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,784
I am a competitor.

989
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,244
I hate losing.

990
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,037
This is not fair to keep people

991
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:08,872
in the game that don't have any

992
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:11,458
physical ability at all.

993
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,000
And they're actually making

994
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:23,678
us lose.

995
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:25,013
>> I'm just going to jump in.

996
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,640
>> Me, too.

997
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,934
>> Whoo!

998
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,187
>> Another day in the dirt.

999
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,189
>> What a challenge.

1000
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,899
It was the muddiest one yet.

1001
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,067
You know how I look at it?

1002
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,403
It's like going to a spa.

1003
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:44,908
>> Oh, you bruised your

1004
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:48,369
shoulder, too, right here.

1005
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,498
>> Right there.

1006
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,874
>> Everybody's down.

1007
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:53,917
Everybody's hurting.

1008
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,294
Everybody's nauseous.

1009
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:56,920
(inhales deeply)

1010
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:59,214
And the Dragon Slayer is just

1011
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,507
coming into his own.

1012
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,759
I feel full of energy, and it's

1013
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,802
time for me to shine.

1014
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:08,223
Off into the horizon.

1015
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,391
But, anyways, we're going to

1016
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,185
Tribal, and part of me says I

1017
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,561
ought to just get rid of

1018
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,604
Russell tonight.

1019
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:15,855
He's knocked out both of my best

1020
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:18,066
friends in this game.

1021
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:18,900
But the way we're losing

1022
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,736
challenges, to keep one of the

1023
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:23,238
weaker girls and get rid of

1024
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,615
Russell-- it might be a mistake.

1025
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,450
So, I guess I'm going to stay

1026
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,952
with the forced five alliance

1027
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,662
and vote out Courtney, who is

1028
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:38,586
the weakest link.

1029
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,381
(thunder rumbling)

1030
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,967
Any, uh, funny stuff going on?

1031
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,760
>> Everything's still the same

1032
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:47,345
as far as I'm concerned.

1033
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,555
>> Yeah.

1034
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,348
>> I get my mind set on one

1035
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:53,810
thing, and I do it.

1036
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:56,104
If I can't trust them, got to

1037
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,023
get rid of them.

1038
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,276
Coach-- Sandra said he wants me

1039
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,026
gone now.

1040
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,571
I have the power in this game.

1041
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:05,113
I send home who I want to

1042
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,116
send home.

1043
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,076
I've already talked to Parvati,

1044
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,036
and she's really on board with

1045
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,788
voting for Coach.

1046
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:15,290
And Sandra and Courtney, I think

1047
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:15,999
they'll put Coach's name down

1048
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,251
for sure.

1049
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,920
So the big Coach, the Coach Man,

1050
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,714
the Dragon Slayer, he's going

1051
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:36,102
home tonight.

1052
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,395
>> Honestly, if we don't merge,

1053
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,396
we're screwed.

1054
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,397
They're going to... they're just

1055
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,398
going to... we'll be done.

1056
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,399
>> That's what's going to

1057
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,400
happen anyway.

1058
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,401
We're losing every single

1059
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,402
one anyway.

1060
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,403
>> No, we're not.

1061
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:46,404
We have a chance if we

1062
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,071
have Coach.

1063
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:47,572
>> Look what we're doing

1064
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:48,740
with Coach.

1065
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:49,407
We're getting dominated.

1066
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:49,991
>> Because of Courtney

1067
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:53,536
and Sandra.

1068
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,537
>> That's a stupid move.

1069
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:55,663
I don't know how you're

1070
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:56,456
thinking right now.

1071
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,290
I don't know how you're playing

1072
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:57,957
the game.

1073
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:58,541
We keep Coach and we lose the

1074
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,167
next one, you'll make sure your

1075
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,085
butt's on the line for that.

1076
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,086
You... you would put your butt

1077
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,004
on the line...

1078
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:03,546
>> I'm just saying we have a

1079
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,922
better shot.

1080
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:05,798
>> I'm not... you are freaking

1081
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:06,132
out right now.

1082
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,675
Chill out.

1083
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,801
>> You ain't making any sense.

1084
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:09,177
>> Yes, I am!

1085
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,220
It's stupid to let him go.

1086
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,221
I don't think it's...

1087
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,222
>> I just told you, I don't

1088
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,223
agree with it.

1089
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,224
>> You're not listening to me!

1090
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,225
>> I ain't going to ... talk

1091
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,226
to you no more.

1092
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:17,685
>> I'm ... giving you

1093
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,770
suggestions.

1094
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:19,437
>> Just calm down!

1095
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,313
>> I'm looking at it in

1096
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,022
different ways.

1097
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:21,439
You're just like...

1098
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:24,692
>> Geez!

1099
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,319
>> Whatever, Russell.

1100
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,321
(groans)

1101
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,323
I think it's really stupid

1102
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,449
to get rid of another

1103
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,450
strong player.

1104
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,743
I mean, Courtney and Sandra

1105
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:34,661
can't do anything in

1106
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:35,328
the challenge.

1107
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:36,454
They've proved that to us a

1108
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,830
million times over.

1109
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:38,373
I mean, Courtney was just

1110
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,249
pathetic.

1111
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,542
And I think we have a shot at

1112
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,127
least with Coach.

1113
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,421
So, I mean, I threw that out

1114
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,632
there, and Russell freaked out

1115
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,634
and screamed at me because he's

1116
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,302
just so in control of this game,

1117
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,762
and everything has to go the

1118
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:53,221
way he wants it to go.

1119
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,807
So, I mean, as of right now, I'm

1120
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,974
up in the air.

1121
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:57,600
I got to really think about what

1122
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:08,820
I want to do.

1123
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:09,946
>> Because she's such a

1124
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:10,321
competitor.

1125
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,074
You know what I'm saying?

1126
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,283
She was like, "I'm done

1127
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,368
suggesting things."

1128
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,244
So I think she must have

1129
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:19,789
suggested something to Russell.

1130
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,127
>> If my plan to vote out Coach

1131
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,753
doesn't work, I think Courtney

1132
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,170
is going home.

1133
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,297
I put a bug in Russell's ear

1134
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,799
that Coach wants to get rid of

1135
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:30,508
him.

1136
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:31,634
But Russell was talking to

1137
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,594
Danielle a few minutes ago.

1138
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,220
And the conversation-- it looked

1139
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:35,138
like it was going back and

1140
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,848
forth.

1141
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,057
So I don't know.

1142
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,934
All I can do is hope that Coach

1143
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:40,560
is going to go home, and that's

1144
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:48,359
it.

1145
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,152
>> Do you know where the saw is?

1146
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,237
The one that we open coconuts

1147
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,364
with?

1148
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:57,618
>> I think Danielle might be

1149
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,119
right.

1150
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,454
We might need to keep him one

1151
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,496
more time.

1152
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,790
We can always take him out, any

1153
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,625
time we want.

1154
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,503
I think we should vote Courtney.

1155
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,047
>> It's absurd.

1156
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,298
First, Russell wants to vote

1157
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,299
off Coach.

1158
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,091
And then, all of a sudden, he

1159
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,385
wants to vote Courtney.

1160
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,219
Jeez!

1161
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,054
This tribe cannot get its act

1162
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:17,472
together.

1163
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,723
That's a problem.

1164
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:19,766
You know, we can't make a

1165
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,018
decision as a cohesive unit to

1166
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:27,106
save our lives.

1167
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,151
>> We couldn't be no cooler.

1168
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,903
>> Hopefully, we all come

1169
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,070
together and vote out the

1170
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:33,404
dragon slayer.

1171
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,907
But who knows?

1172
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,491
They might still get together

1173
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,743
and, say, vote off the weakest

1174
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,870
and target me and vote me out.

1175
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:41,496
You never know what's going to

1176
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,372
happen between now and when the

1177
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,500
sun goes down.

1178
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:02,308
>> PROBST: Let's start tonight's

1179
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:04,644
Tribal Council by going back

1180
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,604
to the last two Tribal Councils.

1181
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,523
Tyson and Rob-- the result:

1182
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:09,148
four straight losses with no

1183
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,192
end in sight.

1184
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,318
Danielle, any second thoughts

1185
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:16,197
about voting out Tyson and Rob?

1186
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,657
>> This decision was made.

1187
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,366
We thought it would be smarter,

1188
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,743
because they were such big

1189
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,744
threats.

1190
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,579
So, it is what it is, Jeff.

1191
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,623
We thought what we did was the

1192
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:26,666
right thing to do.

1193
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:27,625
>> PROBST: But in a physical

1194
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:28,292
challenge, the only person who

1195
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,087
won a point today was Coach.

1196
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:31,712
>> Ah.

1197
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:32,463
>> PROBST: And if given the

1198
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,132
choice of Tyson or Boston Rob

1199
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,551
over, say, Courtney, I think 99

1200
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,177
out of 100 people would probably

1201
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,388
pick Tyson or Boston Rob-- no

1202
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,389
disrespect.

1203
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,723
>> Thank you, Jeffrey.

1204
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,516
>> PROBST: Courtney, you've sat

1205
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,809
out a majority of the

1206
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:45,560
challenges.

1207
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,978
>> That's what the team wanted

1208
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:47,520
to do.

1209
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:48,855
I don't have a big ego that has

1210
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,231
to go and run and play in every

1211
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:50,565
single thing.

1212
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,650
I wasn't a part of the decision

1213
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,069
to vote out Tyson or Rob, so

1214
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:56,988
I'm sad that they're both gone.

1215
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,489
But insulting me is not going

1216
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,365
to bring them back.

1217
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,366
>> PROBST: It's not meant as an

1218
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:01,033
insult.

1219
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,952
It's meant as just one person's

1220
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:03,953
observation.

1221
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:06,163
Boston Rob was dominating.

1222
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,456
>> I agree with you.

1223
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,708
>> PROBST: But Danielle just

1224
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,709
told me that's why you voted

1225
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:09,917
him out.

1226
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:10,585
>> I didn't vote him out of our

1227
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,836
tribe.

1228
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,963
The tribe voted him out, because

1229
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,257
he was not in the dominating

1230
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,259
alliance.

1231
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:18,843
>> PROBST: Coach, what do you

1232
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,470
think the take is on this tribe

1233
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:24,056
from the outside looking in?

1234
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,266
>> I personally feel like

1235
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,976
people are probably laughing at

1236
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:27,602
us right now and saying that we

1237
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,227
deserve it.

1238
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,353
Like, today, when we were

1239
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,897
getting ready for the

1240
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,606
challenge, I was trying to

1241
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:32,857
energize people and I was, like,

1242
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,691
saying, "All right, come on,

1243
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,400
guys, let's do it."

1244
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:35,735
And I had comments like, "Well,

1245
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,612
I'm gonna do my best."

1246
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,529
>> PROBST: Courtney, you're not

1247
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:39,405
having any of that.

1248
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:41,157
>> When, you know, it's a reward

1249
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,992
challenge, it was Coach saying,

1250
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:45,286
"Well, I want to eat, so A

1251
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,579
squad on."

1252
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:47,997
And then, "I don't care about

1253
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,123
the immunity challenge, 'cause

1254
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:49,749
we'll put the two weak people in

1255
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:50,833
there."

1256
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:51,584
And then, obviously, it will

1257
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:52,960
be one of the us going home.

1258
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,253
>> So what I hear from you is

1259
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,546
that the reason why our morale

1260
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,547
is down is because of me.

1261
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:57,798
Is that what I'm hearing?

1262
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:58,466
>> PROBST: That's what I heard.

1263
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,300
>> This is crazy.

1264
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,259
I don't sit there and make

1265
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,470
unilateral decisions and say,

1266
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,387
"By the way, Courtney and

1267
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,430
Sandra, you guys should sit out

1268
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:05,181
every challenge."

1269
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:05,806
I've never said that, because

1270
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:06,474
you don't ever sit out every

1271
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,433
challenge out here, so I would

1272
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,644
never make a foolhardy statement

1273
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,478
like that.

1274
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,688
But what we all want as a tribe

1275
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,398
is for Courtney to say, "I want

1276
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,566
to do that 'cause I can beat

1277
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,442
that challenge."

1278
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:17,860
>> Thanks, Dad.

1279
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:18,653
>> He's a Coach.

1280
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,070
That's what he does.

1281
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:19,654
He tries to pick people up.

1282
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,239
>> I'm not saying that you don't

1283
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,156
mean well, it's just the way

1284
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:22,531
that...

1285
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,115
>> Well, it certainly sounds

1286
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:23,699
like it when you say that I'm

1287
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,327
demoralizing the entire tribe.

1288
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,412
Trust me, I am not the person

1289
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,789
that is demoralizing this tribe.

1290
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,248
In fact, it has absolutely

1291
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,626
nothing to do with me.

1292
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:34,585
>> PROBST: Parvati, are you at

1293
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,379
all concerned that there may

1294
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,296
not be an end to this slide?

1295
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,590
And if you ever do merge with

1296
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,008
the other tribe, your chances

1297
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,134
of winning and getting to the

1298
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:42,426
end go down.

1299
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,553
>> I don't think it's that hard

1300
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,347
to see that we are definitely

1301
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,890
less athletic than them.

1302
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,308
So if we continue to do these

1303
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,060
physical challenges, they're

1304
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,269
going to slaughter us, and we're

1305
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,188
going to go, one by one, down

1306
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:55,231
that trail and our torches are

1307
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,149
going to get put out by you.

1308
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,025
>> PROBST: But we're talking

1309
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,694
around the thing that anybody

1310
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:00,361
watching will know to be true,

1311
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,030
which is, you guys are making

1312
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,532
decisions based on alliances,

1313
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,408
the assumption there might be a

1314
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:06,617
merge, and whatever else happens

1315
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:06,951
down the game.

1316
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:07,535
>> Of course!

1317
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:10,037
I mean, everyone's talking about

1318
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,122
a merge, and now all of the

1319
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:12,081
sudden, there's not going to be

1320
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:12,581
a merge.

1321
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,001
And so it's target the weak, and

1322
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,669
I'm, like, poster child for weak

1323
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:17,420
Survivor.

1324
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:18,462
But I'm still here over a bunch

1325
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,965
of strong players, so twisted

1326
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,383
ankle, skinny chick, whatever,

1327
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,551
I'm a determined little bitch,

1328
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,761
and I will put up with a lot of

1329
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,054
crap to get to the end.

1330
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,015
You know?

1331
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,141
>> Fist bump.

1332
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:30,599
>> That's right, girl.

1333
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,352
(laughs)

1334
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:33,894
>> PROBST: Russell, how is

1335
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,938
tonight's vote going to change

1336
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,189
this tribe?

1337
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,983
>> Well, I think if you can

1338
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:41,569
keep the tribe stronger and

1339
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,612
keep the trust in place, that's

1340
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:44,947
what you need to do.

1341
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,449
And that's what I'm doing

1342
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:49,035
tonight.

1343
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:49,660
>> PROBST: And with that, it is

1344
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,328
time to vote.

1345
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,455
Coach, you're up.

1346
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:11,557
>> You're a freaking lunatic.

1347
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,434
I'm just glad I don't have to

1348
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,852
live with you anymore.

1349
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,479
Nice feather in your hair.

1350
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,368
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1351
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,495
votes.

1352
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:44,840
Once the votes are read, the

1353
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:45,758
decision is final.

1354
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:46,926
Person voted out will be asked

1355
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:47,885
to leave the Tribal Council

1356
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,095
area immediately.

1357
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,222
I'll read the votes.

1358
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,184
First vote: Coach.

1359
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,022
Coach.

1360
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,607
Two votes Coach.

1361
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:04,944
Courtney.

1362
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,153
Two votes Coach, one vote

1363
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,280
Courtney.

1364
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,034
Courtney.

1365
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:12,618
That's two votes Coach, two

1366
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,620
votes Courtney.

1367
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:18,958
Courtney.

1368
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,543
Three votes Courtney, two votes

1369
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:23,462
Coach.

1370
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:26,924
Coach.

1371
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:27,466
We're tied.

1372
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,467
That's three votes Coach, three

1373
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,593
votes Courtney.

1374
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:33,347
One vote left.

1375
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,851
Ninth person voted out of

1376
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,602
<i>Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains</i>

1377
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,229
and the first member of our

1378
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,982
jury...

1379
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:43,983
Coach.

1380
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:47,736
You need to bring me your torch.

1381
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,197
>> Good luck, guys.

1382
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,041
>> PROBST: Coach, tribe has

1383
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,711
spoken.

1384
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,589
Time for you to go.

1385
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,101
Well, after tonight's Tribal

1386
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,936
Council, it's clear that the

1387
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,313
problem with trust, as I'm

1388
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:23,731
sure Coach would agree, is you

1389
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,900
don't know it's gone until it's

1390
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:26,901
too late.

1391
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:27,735
Grab your torches.

1392
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:28,611
Head back to camp.

1393
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:31,071
Good night.

1394
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:42,458
Stay tuned for scenes from our

1395
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:43,751
next episode.

1396
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:48,631
>> PROBST: In 20 seasons, we've

1397
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:49,965
seen a lot of dumb moves.

1398
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:50,674
>> I'll dive right now if you

1399
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,676
take Katie, and I'll give up the

1400
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,302
million.

1401
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:54,094
>> I have two idols.

1402
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,304
I guess I should have played

1403
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:55,679
them.

1404
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:56,555
>> It's not the idol.

1405
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:57,056
>> Why do you say that?

1406
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:57,681
>> It's a ... stick!

1407
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,767
>> I want to give individual

1408
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:00,559
immunity to Natalie.

1409
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,143
>> PROBST: But next time, you

1410
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,853
might see one that tops them

1411
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:03,479
all.

1412
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:04,230
>> I get a chance to talk to

1413
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:04,897
Russell, I give him the hidden

1414
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,024
immunity idol.

1415
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,072
>> I never thought that I would

1416
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,406
be going out so soon.

1417
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,741
I had so much that I wanted to

1418
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,660
accomplish and so much that I

1419
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,370
wanted to prove and redeem.

1420
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,497
I'm exhausted, and still in a

1421
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,456
state of shock.

1422
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:24,375
But I am probably more pissed

1423
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,252
off than I've been in a number

1424
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:26,877
of years.

1425
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,504
And, you know, I really am not a

1426
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,755
very vindictive person, but I

1427
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:30,923
hope they get wiped off the

1428
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,007
face of the map.
