00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:02,585
Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,046
"SURVIVOR."

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,089
AFTER A ROUGH START FOR THE

4
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,925
WOMEN'S TRIBE... WOMEN WIN THEIR

5
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:10,927
THIRD STRAIGHT CHALLENGE!

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,971
MOMENTUM HAD FINALLY SWUNG THEIR

7
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:13,596
WAY.

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,347
BACK AT CAMP, LEIF LEAKED

9
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,225
INFORMATION TO THE ENEMY

10
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:17,517
ALLIANCE.

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,184
WHEN.

12
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,728
WHEN COLTON SAID TO VOTE TO

13
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,062
YOU, I DIDN'T REALLY WANT THAT,

14
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:21,771
YOU KNOW?

15
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,064
Jeff: AND QUICKLY FOUND HIS

16
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,941
NAME ON COLTON'S HIT LIST,

17
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:25,650
ALONGSIDE BILL.

18
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,235
I TOLD YOU TO PICK A SIDE AND

19
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:28,778
YOU PICKED THE WRONG SIDE.

20
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,822
Jeff: AT THE IMMUNITY

21
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:31,114
CHALLENGE...

22
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:31,448
CHEATER!

23
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:31,823
CHEATER!

24
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:34,868
KISS MY ASS.

25
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:35,618
Jeff: ... THE WOMEN

26
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,956
SUFFERED A DEVASTATING LOSS.

27
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:42,167
MEN WIN IMMUNITY!

28
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,169
BUT IT WAS THE MEN'S TRIBE WHO

29
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:44,794
LOST THEIR MIND.

30
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,921
LISTEN YOU LITTLE STUCK-UP

31
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,798
BRAT, I'M TELLING YOU...

32
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,300
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

33
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,761
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

34
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,387
I WANT HIM GONE.

35
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,805
Jeff: COLTON WANTED TO GET

36
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:56,931
RID OF BILL.

37
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,475
WE CAN GIVE THE GIRLS

38
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,851
IMMUNITY AND GO TO TRIBAL

39
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,060
COUNCIL AND VOTE OUT BILL.

40
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,562
I'M LIKE WHAT IN THE WORLD IS

41
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,814
GOING ON?

42
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,483
I'M COMPLETELY BUM-PUZZLED RIGHT

43
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,150
NOW.

44
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:07,817
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF

45
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,485
THIS.

46
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,986
Jeff: EVERYONE GAVE IN, NOT

47
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:11,154
WANTING TO GO AGAINST THE

48
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:11,738
MAJORITY.

49
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,031
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL COLTON

50
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:13,656
CONTINUED HIS ATTACK ON BILL.

51
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,493
HE'S A STRUGGLING STANDUP

52
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,035
COMIC.

53
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,578
LIKE, GET A REAL JOB.

54
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,497
ME BEING POOR, THAT'S JUST MY

55
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,164
LIFE.

56
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:21,873
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SUGAR COAT

57
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:22,582
IT.

58
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:23,541
I DON'T ASSOCIATE WITH PEOPLE

59
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,126
LIKE THAT IN THE REAL WORLD AND

60
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,045
I'M SURE AS HELL NOT GOING TO

61
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,004
ASSOCIATE WITH PEOPLE LIKE THAT

62
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:28,671
OUT HERE.

63
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:32,133
Jeff: IN THE END, COLTON

64
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:32,759
GOT HIS WAY.

65
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:33,426
FOURTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF

66
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,136
"SURVIVOR: ONE WORLD," BILL.

67
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,179
AND NOW THE MEN AND WOMEN ARE

68
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,515
EVEN AT SEVEN AND IT'S ANYONE'S

69
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:38,890
GAME.

70
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:39,599
14 ARE LEFT.

71
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,392
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT.

72
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,869
IT FEELS LIKE IT TODAY.

73
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,454
YOU GUYS ARE HUNKERED DOWN

74
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,873
TOGETHER, MAN.

75
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:04,374
TROY, WHOSE IDEA WAS IT TO

76
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,584
GIVE UP THE IDOL?

77
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:10,088
GIVE THE IDOL BACK?

78
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:10,839
COLTON'S.

79
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,882
BUT YOU KNOW IN SOME GUYS HEADS

80
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:13,591
THEY WERE GOING HOME.

81
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,052
I DIDN'T WANT TO AGREE WITH IT

82
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:17,178
BUT IT'S A GROUP THING SO I

83
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:17,762
DON'T KNOW.

84
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:18,471
WE REALLY SHOULD HAVE SIX

85
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,266
PEOPLE ON THIS TRIBE BUT WE HAVE

86
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:21,975
SEVEN.

87
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,685
THE GUYS ARE MUCH MORE OF A MESS

88
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,854
THAN WHAT WE THOUGHT, YOU KNOW?

89
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,063
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO QUESTION

90
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:27,814
THEIR NONSENSE OVER THERE.

91
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:28,523
I'M HAPPY WE HAVE SEVEN AND THE

92
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,275
GIRLS ARE STICKING TOGETHER ON

93
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,568
THIS ONE.

94
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,361
IF WE'RE GOING TO STICK AS A

95
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:36,072
TRIBE OF ALL GIRLS, WE NEED TO

96
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:36,906
BE SEVEN GOING IN STRONG.

97
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,615
WE HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER

98
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,994
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

99
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,537
HECK THESE GUYS ARE THINKING.

00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,247
IT'S LIKE... I MEAN, IT'S CRAZY

YES.

104
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,250
WE NEED TO WIN IT.

105
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:47,917
YEAH.

00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,711

00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:51,921
I REALLY WANT TO WIN.

109
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,882
IF WE COME IN STRONG SEVEN

110
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,425
WE'RE GOING TO BLOW THEM AWAY.

111
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,926
WE'RE GOING TO BEAT THEM TODAY

112
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:57,886
IN OUR CHALLENGE.

113
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,095
THEY ARE SO DUMB.

114
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,931
THEY HANDED US A MILLION

115
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,017
DOLLARS.

116
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:30,126
Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

117
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,669

00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,296
YES, SIR.

120
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,297
Jeff: ALL RIGHT, BEFORE WE

121
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,590
GET TO THE CHALLENGE, YOU CAN

122
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,425
DROP YOUR BUFFS, BECAUSE WE ARE

123
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:40,970
SWITCHING TRIBES.

124
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,138
NO WAY!

125
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:43,473
OH, MY GOD!

126
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,682
Jeff: TAKE THEM OFF AND

127
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,684
DROP THEM AT YOUR FEET.

128
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,646
OH, BOY.

129
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,147
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO TAKE

130
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,149
THIS THING OFF.

131
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:53,983
HERE WE GO.

132
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:54,317
Jeff: HERE'S HOW IT'S GOING

133
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:54,984
TO WORK.

134
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,488
IT WILL BE A RANDOM SWITCH.

135
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,948
YOU'RE EACH GOING TO DRAW AN

136
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:00,657
EGG.

137
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,449
WHEN I TELL YOU TO, YOU'LL SMASH

138
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,868
IT AGAINST YOUR BODY.

139
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:04,577
TAKEN A EGG.

140
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,496
DON'T DO ANYTHING WITH IT YET.

141
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:10,333
WHATEVER COLOR COMES OUT WILL

142
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,336
DETERMINE WHAT TRIBE YOU ARE ON.

143
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,462
CAN WE EAT THIS THING?

144
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,463
Jeff: I'M GOING TO COUNT

145
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,130

163
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,001

FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU WILL

WORK TOGETHER.

184
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,245
TEAMS OF FOUR WILL CARRY A LARGE

185
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:29,704
BUCKET TO A WATER TOWER WHERE

186
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,748
YOU WILL FILL IT.

00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,416
ON YOUR WAY BACK YOU WILL WORK

332
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,244
IS THIS REALLY REAL?

333
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,996
MAYBE A SLICE WITH PEANUT

335
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:23,873
OH, MY GOD!

00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,893
WHEN I CRACKED THAT EGG AND I

344
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,394

345
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,896
AND JAY WAS COVERED IN BLUE AND

346
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:47,772

A LOT MORE POTS AND PANS.

352
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:02,912
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE

353
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:03,245
FINE.

354
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:03,871

360
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,753
THIS IS A BETTER PLACE.

361
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:11,420
SOFT SAND.

362
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,714
NOT ONLY DID I GET ON A TRIBE

363
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:14,423

THEY'RE GOING TO DOMINATE US IN

371
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:27,978

THEY'RE EATING PEANUT BUTTER AND

373
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:29,939
JELLY SANDWICHES.

374
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:30,815
THEY'RE GETTING STRONGER THAN

WE ARE NOT GOING TO WIN.

379
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:36,946
I ALREADY KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING

00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:37,655
TO WIN.

381
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:38,906
EVEN IF THE GIRLS DIDN'T HAVE

382
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:43,119
THE GUYS ON THEIR TEAM AT SALANI

383
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,453
THEY'D STILL PROBABLY KICK OUR

384
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,037
BUTTS.

385
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:49,875
THAT'S HOW SAD THAT IS.

386
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,003
THE PRINCE AND THE PRINCESS.

387
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,089
WILL YOU BE MY PRINCE?

388
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:55,840
WILL YOU BE MY PRINCESS?

389
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,592
EVEN THOUGH I CAN BE A COMPLETE

390
00:11:58,676 --> 00:11:59,135
AND TOTAL EVIL PERSON, I KNOW

391
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,345
HOW TO RELATE TO PEOPLE.

392
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,596
I KNOW HOW TO CHARM PEOPLE.

393
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,514
I KNOW HOW TO TELL THEM WHAT

394
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:04,640
THEY WANT TO HEAR.

395
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:07,309
I KNOW HOW TO GET THEM ON MY

396
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:07,977
SIDE.

397
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,145
I WANT TO GIVE MY LOYALTY TO

398
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:09,562

00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:15,484
BLINDSIDED.

00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:16,819
BUT WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER.

406
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,530
WE HAVE TO ACT LIKE WE'RE A

407
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:20,156
UNIFIED TRIBE.

408
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,157

I HOPE YOU'RE STILL WITH US.

439
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,361

JUST ONE RIGHT ON THE OTHER

449
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:16,545
SIDE OF THAT ROCK.

450
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,213
WHERE?

451
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:17,880
I DON'T SEE.

00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:29,058
JUST POKE THEM IN THE CENTER.

458
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,017
THAT'S IT.

459
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,726
THAT'S FOUR.

460
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,562
THIS WILL BE OUR LUNCH WITH P.B.

461
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,730

469
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,580
SABRINA, CLOSE IN OVER THERE.

470
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,081
MIKE, PUT YOUR STUFF DOWN AND

471
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,251
CLOSE IN.

472
00:13:55,334 --> 00:14:01,090
(CHICKENS CLUCKING)

473
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,758
WHERE IS HE?

474
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,426
WHERE IS HE?

475
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,138

476
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,099

477
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:10,474
YES!

478
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:14,270
(SCREAMING)

479
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,939
TODAY HAS BEEN JUST

480
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:17,648
FANTASTIC.

481
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,275
IT REMINDED ME BACK IN 1979 WHEN

482
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,110
I PLAYED CORNERBACK FOR THE

483
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,111
CENTRAL VALLEY BEARS.

484
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,112
WHICH WAY IS HE GOING?

485
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:23,779
BOOM.

486
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:26,282
I MEAN, IT WAS TOTAL INSTINCT.

487
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:26,657
THAT WAS IT.

488
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,075
GAME OVER.

489
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,201
SORRY, CHICKEN, YOU LOSE.

490
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,119
(LAUGHS)

491
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,453
HOLY CRAP!

492
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,538
WE GOT MORE.

493
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,123
OH, MY GOD!

494
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,458
WE CAUGHT A ROOSTER TODAY.

495
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,795
MIKE AND CHELSEA GOT FOUR HUGE

496
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:40,296
CRABS.

497
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,964
GOOD DAY OF HUNTING.

498
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:42,381
(APPLAUSE)

499
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,382
SALANI, BABY.

500
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,091
SALANI.

501
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,176
IT'S LIKE THE GODS SAID "COME

502
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,761
TOGETHER AND I WILL PROVIDE YOU

503
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,388
WITH WHAT YOU WANT."

504
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:53,142
IT'S BEEN WILD!

505
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,769
HAY, TROY, DO WE HAVE ANY

506
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,312
SPACE BETWEEN US AND THE REST OF

507
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,439
THE PEOPLE IN THE OCEAN?

508
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,399
MIKE AND KAT ARE IN THE

509
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:00,774
OCEAN.

510
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,860
THAT'S IT.

511
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,654
WE WERE THINKING GOING INTO A

512
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,322
MERGE SITUATION WE WANT TO MAKE

513
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,240
SURE YOU HAVE A SOLID FOUR OR

514
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:08,991
FIVE PEOPLE.

515
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,034
THE BOY IN THE OCEAN IS NOT ONE

516
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,785
OF THEM.

517
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:12,202
FINE WITH ME, DUDE.

518
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,162
YOU KNOW ME.

519
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,164
I THINK IT'S SALANI VERSUS

520
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,832
MANONO RIGHT NOW.

521
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:17,541
I DON'T THINK IT'S MEN VERSUS

522
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,250
WOMEN AND IF IT WAS WE WOULD BE

523
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,669
ON THE OUTS BECAUSE WE'RE DOWN A

524
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,670
MAN AS FAR AS OUR TRIBE GOES.

525
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,005
THEY HAVE ONE MORE GIRL.

526
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,548
I DON'T MIND AT ALL WORKING WITH

527
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,507
THESE WOMEN.

528
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,634
I THINK I CAN TRUST THEM.

529
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:27,343
I WANT TO GET TO KNOW THEM

530
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,386
BETTER AND SEE WHERE THEIR HEADS

531
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:29,928
ARE AT.

532
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,013
WHAT'S CHELSEA LIKE?

533
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,681
CHELSEA'S GREAT.

534
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,849
SHE HASN'T BEEN PLAYING

535
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:34,516
STRATEGY.

536
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,019
SHE'S JUST KIND OF... SHE'S

537
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:37,436
GAME.

538
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,188
I TRUST HER.

539
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,689
ALL RIGHT.

540
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,192
WHATEVER MERGE SITUATION

541
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:43,901
HAPPENS.

542
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,361
LET'S INTERMINGLE, WEAVE OUR WAY

543
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:45,986
INTO IT.

544
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,488
AND WHEN IT COMES TIME TO

545
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,989
VOTE WE HAVE TO TELL EACH OTHER

546
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:49,698
WHAT'S GOING DOWN AND MAKE SURE

547
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,241
THAT IT GOES NOT TOWARDS ANY ONE

548
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,203
OF US AND PRETTY SOON WE'RE IN

549
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,412
THE MAJORITY AND IT DOESN'T

550
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,038
MATTER ANYMORE.

551
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,873
THIS HAS BEEN MY THING ALL

552
00:15:57,956 --> 00:15:58,582
ALONG.

553
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,042
I'M TRYING TO KEEP MY OPTIONS

554
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:00,709
OPEN SO IF STICKING WITH THE

555
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,878
GIRLS WORKS BEST FOR ME I'LL

556
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:03,879
STICK WITH THE GIRLS.

557
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:05,547
AND IF WE GET TO THE MERGE AND

558
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,924
DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS, TROY AND

559
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,425
JAY ARE MY ALLIANCE ALL THE WAY.

560
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,259
I CAN'T GET OVER HOW THIS COULD

561
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,679
NOT HAVE GONE ANY BETTER FOR ME

562
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:12,596
AND HOW MUCH FUN I'M HAVING

563
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,263
DOING THIS.

564
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,890
ANYBODY ELSE WANT TO CHEW ON

565
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:15,224
THAT?

566
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,225
OH, YEAH.

567
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,434
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE

568
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,019
HARD AND A GRIND AND I KNOW IT

569
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:19,895
WILL HAVE ITS MOMENTS BUT THIS

570
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:20,437
IS NOT ONE OF THEM.

571
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,230
THIS IS A GOOD TIME.

572
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,233
I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB.

573
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,902
I DON'T LIKE HAVING TO TRUST

574
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:28,028
PEOPLE THAT I DON'T TRUST.

575
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,613
WELL, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

576
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,698
TRY TO TRUST THEM.

577
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,241
OH, I TRUST MONICA.

578
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,076
YOU DON'T TRUST CHRISTINA?

579
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:34,743
NO.

580
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,327
NOT AT ALL.

581
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,913
I DON'T, EITHER.

582
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:39,331
I'M ALMOST THINKING-- DON'T

583
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,458
YOU DARE SAY ANYTHING TO MONICA

584
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,459
ABOUT THIS, YOU SWEAR?

585
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,127
SWEAR.

586
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:47,798
WE NEED TO GET OUT CHRISTINA

587
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:48,382
FIRST.

588
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,425
WE NEED FOUR, THOUGH.

589
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,468
I'M TELLING YOU, WE MIGHT BE

590
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:55,264
SAFER WITH TARZAN AND JONAS.

591
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,348
I'M TELLING YOU.

592
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,266
I'M TELLING YOU.

593
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,267
NO.

594
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,935
THAT'S UNSTABLE.

595
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:00,602
UH-UH.

596
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,228
THAT'S WHY YOU GUYS HAD ALL THAT

597
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,939
CRAZY STUFF GOING DOWN.

598
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:04,481
LEAVE IT AS IT IS.

599
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,191
THE GIRLS ARE LOYAL.

600
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,110
YOU GUYS ARE THE ONES WHO ARE

601
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:08,819
CRAZY.

602
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,738
I DON'T CONSIDER COLTON AS A GUY

603
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,780
SO I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE FOUR

604
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,073
WOMEN AGAINST THREE GUYS.

605
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,117
BUT COLTON'S CRAZY.

606
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,910
HE REALLY WANTS CHRISTINA OUT

607
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,287
BUT I NEED TO KEEP MY WOMEN HERE

608
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,330
AND GET RID OF THE GUYS SO THAT

609
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,625
WHEN WE MERGE I'M STILL THERE.

610
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:33,635
OR... OR AT LEAST KEEP MY NAME

611
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,470
IN THE MIX.

612
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,804
SO WHAT'S THE STORY BETWEEN

613
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:36,346
YOU AND ALICIA.

614
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,807
I'M JUST TALKING TO HER.

615
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:39,308
YOU'RE IN GOOD WITH HER.

616
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:39,975
WHAT'S THE PLAN?

617
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:43,145
I'M STICKING WITH THE GUYS,

618
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:43,854
HONESTLY.

619
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:44,813
I CAN'T AFFORD TO GO WITH THESE

620
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,481
WOMEN.

621
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,815
WHILE WE'RE WORKING BUSTING

622
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,609
OUR ASS BUILDING A SHELTER,

623
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,110
COLTON IS DOING THE SAME THING!

624
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,279
HE'S JUST SITTING ON HIS ASS

625
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,072
TALKING TO ALICIA.

626
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,825
I'M LIKE WHAT IS GOING ON?

627
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,827
HOW... HOW DOES HE GET AWAY WITH

628
00:17:58,911 --> 00:17:59,536
THIS?

629
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,497
I... IT JUST... IT'S... I NEVER

630
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,710
THOUGHT TO PLAY THAT GAME.

631
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:07,377
IT'S BRILLIANT.

632
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,629
THEY HAVE TO THINK I'M THEIR

633
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:09,004
FOURTH.

634
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:09,588
BUT I'M NOT.

635
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,422
YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME.

636
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,299
DON'T SCAM ME BRO.

637
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,842
FIST BUMP, I'M NOT.

638
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:14,301
SERIOUSLY.

639
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,010
I PROMISE YOU.

640
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:17,846
HALF OF ME BELIEVES HIM, HALF

641
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,348
OF ME IS LIKE... HE'S LIKE "I'M

642
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,307
SUCH A GIRL."

643
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,476
WHAT IS THAT?

644
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,144
CHRISTINA'S GOING FIRST?

645
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:24,561
YES, JUST REMEMBER TO WRITE

646
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,896
HER NAME DOWN.

647
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:26,855
ALL RIGHT, GOOD DEAL?

648
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:27,481
OKAY, SWEET ENOUGH.

649
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,150
IT'S KIND OF LIKE COLTON'S

650
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,987
JUST RUNNING THE SHOW ON BOTH

651
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,197
SIDES WITH THE WOMEN AND THE MEN

652
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,491
BUT IT WOULD BE RICK RIDICULOUS

653
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:38,367
FOR ME NOT TO THINK HE'S

654
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,369
ALIGNING WITH THE WOMEN RIGHT

655
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:40,744
NOW.

656
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:50,921
OH, MY GOD!

657
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:55,843
OH, MY GOD!

658
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,219
SABRINA FINDS THE IMMUNITY

659
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,847
IDOL BUT IT'S NOT FOR OUR TRIBE.

660
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,222
SHE GETS TO PLAY IT FOR ONE OF

661
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,390
THE GUYS.

662
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,892
NOBODY REALLY HAD THE GIRLS'

663
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:04,893
IDOL AND SOMETHING MAP ISED FOR

664
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,020
ME AND I THOUGHT I'M LITERALLY

665
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,564
GOING TO FIND THIS RIGHT NOW.

666
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,398
IT'S OUT HERE SOMEWHERE.

667
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:14,194
I WALKED ALL AROUND THE GUY'S

668
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:14,653
SIDE LOOKED AT EVERY TREE,

669
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:15,362
NOTHING, NOTHING.

670
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,573
I WAS GETTING DISCOURAGED AND

671
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:21,410
SAID, LORD, PLEASE.

672
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:30,419
THANK YOU.

673
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,753
FINALLY.

674
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,422
I JUST FOUND THE IMMUNITY IDOL.

675
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,549
IT'S REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

676
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,384
IT FEELS AMAZING.

677
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,427
I'VE LOOKED SO HARD SO I HAD TO

678
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,221
LITERALLY REACH IN THERE AND

679
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,306
FEEL IT.

680
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:45,434
I JUST FOUND THE IMMUNITY IDOL

681
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:45,851
AND IT'S IN MY CROTCH.

682
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,060
YOU'RE LYING.

683
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:47,436
I'M NOT.

684
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:54,234
SHUT UP!

685
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,613
OKAY, ARE YOU READY?

686
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:01,116
HOLY COW!

687
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:01,783
DAMN!

688
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,451
AS SOON AS I FOUND THE IDOL

689
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,786
I'VE KIND OF BEEN THINKING I

690
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,413
MIGHT KEEP IT TO MYSELF BUT AS I

691
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,456
WAS TRYING TO GRAB IT AND GET IT

692
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,791
I THOUGHT THERE'S NO ONE I TRUST

693
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,459
IN THIS GAME MORE THAN CHELSEA

694
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,419
IF I'M GOING TO DO THIS WITH

695
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,962
ANYONE IT WILL BE WITH HER SO I

696
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,505
DECIDED TO LET HER IN ON IT.

697
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,299
NOW THAT WE HAVE THIS AND WE

698
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,759
CAN LITERALLY... LIKE, THIS

699
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:19,927
COULD BE A GAME CHANGER WHERE WE

700
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,931
TAKE THE NUMBERS.

701
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,766
NO ONE CAN KNOW, NOT A WORD OF

702
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:26,058
IT.

703
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:26,642
HELL NO.

704
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,935
AND WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL

705
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:28,602
THEY DON'T SEE US AS A PAIR

706
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,312
BECAUSE THE OTHER ONE WOULD

707
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,021
NEVER HAVE AN IDEA.

708
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,606
WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

709
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:36,985
WE HAVE OUR ALLIANCE WITH AS

710
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:37,945
MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE.

711
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:44,952
THIS IS AWESOME.

712
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,954
PULL THE THING.

713
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:47,454
PULL IT!

714
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:47,746
PULL IT!

715
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:48,205
PULL IT!

716
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:51,375
SLOWLY, SLOWLY.

717
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,543
WHAT ARE YOU?

718
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,002
(SCREAMING)

719
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,630
WE GOT A CHICKEN!

720
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,464
WE GOT A CHICKEN!

721
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,382
OH, MY GOD!

722
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,466
WE ARE SO FED!

723
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,510
LOOK AT THAT!

724
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,136
WE ARE SO FED!

725
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,847
WE'RE SO AWESOME, GUYS!

726
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,349
HOW'D HE GET OUT?

727
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,102
THESE PEOPLE SUCK AT

728
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:10,811
"SURVIVOR."

729
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,145
I MEAN, LET'S JUST BE HONEST.

730
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,522
THEY SUCK AT "SURVIVOR."

731
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,857
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO LOSE THE

732
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,693
IMMUNITY CHALLENGES REGARDLESS.

733
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:18,193
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A CHANCE

734
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:18,777
IN HELL OF WINNING.

735
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,362
I GUESS WE SHOULD HAVE

736
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,530
CHECKED THE SIDES OF THE COOP.

737
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,698
THAT'S EMBARRASSING.

738
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,491
I THINK MONICA AND CHRISTINA

739
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,034
ARE BOTH ON THE OUTS BUT MONICA

740
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,869
HAS WAY MORE POWER THAN

741
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:28,578
CHRISTINA.

742
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,288
CHRISTINA HAS NO FRIENDS ON THAT

743
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,123
OTHER TRIBE AND WHEN WE MERGE IF

744
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,332
MONICA'S AT THAT MERGE IT'S

745
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,333
GOING TO BE BAD.

746
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,043
IF CHRISTINA'S THERE, IT'S NOT A

747
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:35,877
BIG DEAL.

748
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,170
SHE'S GOING TO BE EASY TO GET

749
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,006
RID OF.

750
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,215
HERE'S THE THING I NEED TO KNOW

751
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:40,882
FROM YOU.

752
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,384
THIS IS JUST ME AND YOU TALKING,

753
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:42,676
OKAY?

754
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,218
OKAY.

755
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:46,680
MONICA'S A HELL OF A LOT

756
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:47,723

00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,928
MICHAEL AND JAY NOW DOUBLE

947
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:00,970
TEAMING ON COLTON.

948
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:04,766
HELP ME!

949
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:05,934
Jeff: COLTON IS NOT GIVING

950
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:06,976
UP THAT BALL.

951
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,063
TARZAN TRYING TO TAKE JAY OFF OF

952
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:14,067
COLTON WHO WILL NOT GIVE UP THE

953
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:14,609
BALL.

954
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:15,276
JAY TAKES DOWN TROYZAN.

955
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,779
JONAS TAKING DOWN TROYZAN.

956
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:21,950
COLTON TAKES A LONG SHOT BUT

957
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:27,414
IT'S SHORT JAY GETS PASSED

958
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,207
TARZAN, JAY CAN WIN IT BUT HE'S

959
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:29,749
SHORT.

960
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,794
ANOTHER SHOT MISSES.

961
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:33,962
TROYZAN!

962
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,297
MISSES.

963
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,006
MICHAEL SCORES FOR SALANI.

964
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,925
SALANI WINS IMMUNITY!

965
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:44,013
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

966
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,015
ALL RIGHT, GUYS!

967
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,809
GOOD JOB!

968
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:54,149
GOOD JOB, GUYS.

969
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,692
SALANI, CONGRATULATIONS.

970
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:56,526
IMMUNITY IS YOURS.

971
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,445
NO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

972
00:28:58,528 --> 00:28:59,654
HEAD ON OUT.

973
00:28:59,737 --> 00:29:03,825
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.

974
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,828
MANONO, SOMEBODY GOING HOME.

975
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,329
YOU HAVE TO AFTERNOON TO FIGURE

976
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,165
OUT WHO IT'S GOING TO BE.

977
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,250
SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.

978
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,185
WE DID WHAT WE COULD.

979
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,895
IT'S KIND OF HARD GOING UP

980
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,521
AGAINST THAT KIND OF

981
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,230
COMPETITION.

982
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,231
AT LEAST IT WASN'T A SHUTOUT.

983
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,191
WE GOT ONE ON THE BOARD.

984
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:36,524
YUP.

985
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,986
ONE POINT.

986
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,029
PUT IT HERE, BABY.

987
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,405
GOOD JOB, MONICA.

988
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,032
I'M SORRY I LET YOU GUYS

989
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:44,699
DOWN.

990
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:49,746
YOU DID MORE THAN ANY OF US,

991
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:53,541
THOUGH.

992
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,418
WELL, NOW WHAT?

993
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,045
TODAY YOU WILL SEE AN OSCAR

994
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,588
PERFORMANCE FROM COLTON AND I

995
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,924
FOR THE BEST BLIND SIDE EVER

996
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,718
PLAYED.

997
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:05,678
MONICA'S GOING HOME TONIGHT.

998
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,514
SO IF YOU GUYS ARE VOTING OFF

999
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:08,723
A GIRL TONIGHT, PLEASE THINK

1000
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:09,474
ABOUT STAYING STRONG.

1001
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,433
DEFINITELY.

1002
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,726
SO THAT WE CAN WIN THE

1003
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:13,561
CHALLENGE TOMORROW.

1004
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,064
I'M GLAD WE'RE ON THE SAME

1005
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:16,773
PAGE.

1006
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,399
AND I'M SURE SHE THINKS SHE'S IN

1007
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,067
A SAFE SPOT BECAUSE SHE DID

1008
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,069
SCORE US A BASKET BUT SHE'S

1009
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:31,913
GOING HOME.

1010
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:32,956
AND, HEY, ALICIA IS FOLLOWING ME

1011
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:38,711
LIKE A FIDDLE.

1012
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,755
IF FOLLOWING COLTON MEANS

1013
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:41,631
VOTING OUT SOMEBODY ELSE AND

1014
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,799
GETTING ME ONE STEP FURTHER TO

1015
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:43,550
THE MILLION, AWESOME.

1016
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,718
I COULD BE COLTON'S BITCH, I'LL

1017
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,595
BE WHATEVER YOU WANT ME TO BE.

1018
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,721
BUT JUST DON'T VOTE ME OFF.

1019
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,265
(LAUGHS)

1020
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,224
WE NEED TO WIN.

1021
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:51,891
I KNOW.

1022
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,434
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST GET

1023
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,769
RID OF TARZAN.

1024
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:56,104
I THINK SO.

1025
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,231
I DON'T WANT TO KEEP TALKING.

1026
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:00,066
TELL MONICA THAT.

1027
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:03,736
I WANTED TO SAY IT AND WHEN

1028
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,405
ALICIA SAID IT IT WAS LIKE COOL,

1029
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,281
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS

1030
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,115
THINKING AND TARZAN AT THE

1031
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,158
CHALLENGE TODAY LOOKED LIKE WASH

1032
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,411
AGO WOUNDED HIPPO TRYING TO WALK

1033
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:16,124
OVER TO THE WATER SO I THINK IT

1034
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,959
COMES TO A UNANIMOUS DECISION

1035
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,502
THAT HE JUST NEEDS TO GO.

1036
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,296
WE NEED TO GET RID OF TARZAN.

1037
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,130
YEAH, THAT WAS A LITTLE

1038
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,965
AWKWARD TODAY AT THE CHALLENGE.

1039
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,508
ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

1040
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,595
I'M COOL WITH THAT.

1041
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:29,304
.

1042
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,306
THAT'S LITERALLY WHAT WE JUST

1043
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:31,973
SAID.

1044
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:32,515
LITERALLY.

1045
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,433
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO WIN

1046
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:33,975
TOMORROW.

1047
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,101
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

1048
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:38,021
DON'T TELL TARZAN BUT WE'RE

1049
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,106
GOING TO BLIND SIDE HIM.

1050
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,983
OKAY.

1051
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,651
JUST AS LONG AS IT'S NOT ME.

1052
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,485
TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

1053
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,153
WE HAVE... I MEAN, WE HAVE TO

1054
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:45,612
WIN.

1055
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:45,945
WE HAVE TO WIN.

1056
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,572
NO DOUBT.

1057
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,866
THAT'S THE THING.

1058
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,284
THIS IS ONE WORLD, BABY, THIS

1059
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:51,951
IS ONE WORLD.

1060
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,495
WE HAVE TO THINK LIKE THAT.

1061
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,788
ARE ARE YOU INN.

1062
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,457
YEAH, IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES

1063
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,334
TO KEEP US UNIFIED, WE'VE GOT TO

1064
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,001
DO IT.

1065
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,044
THE GUYS HAVE LOST SIGHT ON

1066
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,837
THE NUMBERS GAME.

1067
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,797
I MEAN, IT'S TARZAN TONIGHT.

1068
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,799
IN MY MIND I'M THINKING THAT'S A

1069
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:07,508
HUGE WIN FOR THE WOMEN THAT THE

1070
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,552
MEN ARE ON BOARD TO TAKE OUT ONE

1071
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,179
OF THE MEN.

1072
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,181
WE'RE ALL THINKING THAT WE'VE

1073
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,976
GOT TO GET RID OF TARZAN BECAUSE

1074
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,187
HE'S KIND OF DIVIDING THE TRIBE

1075
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,021
UP RIGHT NOW.

1076
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,857
ALL RIGHT.

1077
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,191
YEAH.

1078
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:23,566
AND SO...

1079
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,567
TARZAN.

1080
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,109
YEAH.

1081
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,277
ALL RIGHT, FOR SURE.

1082
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,612
TARZAN.

1083
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,822
TARZAN.

1084
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,033
IN A WEIRD WAY, THAT WHOLE

1085
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,702
EVENT THAT HAPPENED WITH LEIF

1086
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,079
TELLING BILL THAT HE WAS GOING

1087
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,206
HOME, THAT SORT OF TIPPED ME OFF

1088
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:42,752
TO BEING A LITTLE LEERY OF LEIF

1089
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,212
AND NOT TO TRUST HIM SO MUCH.

1090
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,089
START BLOWING, SOMEBODY.

1091
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:49,842
SO LEIF IS DEFINITELY A WILD

1092
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:53,137
CARD AND HE DID DO SOME PRETTY

1093
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,098
CRAZY THINGS AND WITH FOUR GUYS

1094
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,225
AND THREE GIRLS.

1095
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,851
ANYBODY COULD FLIP ON THE GUYS

1096
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,228
SIDE AND JUST, YOU KNOW, MAKE IT

1097
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,522
THE GIRLS GAME NOW.

1098
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:03,773
THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.

1099
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:04,232
WE'RE VOTING OUT MONICA.

1100
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,901
SO IT'S MONICA?

1101
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:09,612
NOW TELL ME WHO MONICA IS AGAIN?

1102
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:10,446
PINK BIKINI.

1103
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,781
YEAH.

1104
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:12,407
OH, GOOD.

1105
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:12,907
OKAY.

1106
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:13,616
YEAH, YEAH.

1107
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,034
SHE IS THE HEAD OF THE SNAKE,

1108
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,786
DO YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?

1109
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:17,787
AND ALICIA SAID MONICA'S TRYING

1110
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,497
TO PLAY ME, PLAY YOU, PLAY

1111
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:19,914
EVERYBODY.

1112
00:33:19,997 --> 00:33:21,541
YEAH, SHE IS.

1113
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:23,209
I'VE GOT ALICIA VOTING WITH

1114
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,752
US JUST IN CASE YOU DON'T.

1115
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,878
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

1116
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,088
Y'ALL ARE ON BOARD?

1117
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,424
YES, I AGREE YOU WITH YOU 100%.

1118
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,925
PLEASE, LEIF.

1119
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:32,093
I TOLD LEIF AND TARZAN BASICALLY

1120
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:32,969
THIS IS THE DEAL.

1121
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:34,846
WE'RE VOTING OUT MONICA BUT

1122
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:35,555
TARZAN IS ALMOST LIKE HAVING A

1123
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:36,973
GRANDFATHER WITH ALZHEIMER'S AND

1124
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,224
YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM SOMETHING

1125
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:38,933
87 TIMES.

1126
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:40,935
YOU HAVE TO KEEP REPEATING IT,

1127
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:42,103
REPEATING IT, REPEATING IT

1128
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,438
BECAUSE HE FORGETS IT.

1129
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,398
JUST REMEMBER, MONICA

1130
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:45,690
TONIGHT.

1131
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:46,023
RIGHT.

1132
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:46,983
MONICA.

1133
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,276
JUST REMEMBER MONICA LEWINSKY.

1134
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,152
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A

1135
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:49,861
MINUTE... OKAY.

1136
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:52,280
I HAVE TO MAKE SURE BEFORE WE

1137
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,157
GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL HE KNOWS

1138
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,908
WHO TO WRITE DOWN OR HE COULD

1139
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:58,035
WRITE DOWN JENNY FOR ALL WE

1140
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:58,578
KNOW.

1141
00:33:58,661 --> 00:33:59,120
DOES THIS LOOK OKAY?

1142
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,455
YEAH, YOU LOOK GREAT.

1143
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,290
IF I WERE WORKING WITH, LIKE,

1144
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,126
SOMEWHAT INTELLIGENT PEOPLE WHO

1145
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,961
COULD KIND OF HELP ME OUT AND I

1146
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:08,963
DIDN'T HAVE TO MAKE ALL OF THE

1147
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:09,922
DECISIONS IT WOULD BE SO EASY.

1148
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,132
BUT LITERALLY IT'S REALLY HARD

1149
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:15,845
BEING THE LEADER OF A BUNCH OF

1150
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:16,345
IDIOTS.

1151
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:26,314
IT'S SO DIFFICULT.

1152
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:36,616
IT'S SO DIFFICULT.

1153
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,283
Jeff: SO LET'S TALK ABOUT

1154
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:40,036
THIS NEW MANONO TRIBE.

1155
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,621
JONAS, WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION OF

1156
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:42,288
YOUR NEW TRIBE?

1157
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,499
WELL, THE ODDS WERE NOT

1158
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,334
STACKED IN OUR FAVOR, LET'S JUST

1159
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,502
PUT IT THAT WAY.

1160
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,211
Jeff: MONICA, GIVE ME YOUR

1161
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,338
INPUT ON THIS NEW TRIBE.

1162
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,298
WELL, BREAKING UP WAS HARD TO

1163
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,007
DO.

1164
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,300
WE'D GOTTEN CLOSE, THE GIRLS.

1165
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,052
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY TURNED OUT TO

1166
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:56,969
BE A BLESSING.

1167
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,972
OUR BEACH IS BETTER, OUR FOOD IS

1168
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,849
PLENTIFUL AND WE'VE... WE'RE

1169
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,935
PLAYING LIKE A TEAM, I THINK.

1170
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,771
Jeff: COLTON, DO YOU LIKE

1171
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:07,730
MONICA'S POSITIVE ATTITUDE?

1172
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:08,815
I MEAN, YEAH.

1173
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,024
IF SHE THINKS THAT SHE CAN TURN

1174
00:35:10,107 --> 00:35:13,027
THIS SINKING SHIP AROUND, BY ALL

1175
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,696
MEANS, HONEY, TAKE THE WHEEL.

1176
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,532
WE NEED MONICA.

1177
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,367
Jeff: ALICIA, IS IT

1178
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,701
POSSIBLE THAT MONICA COULD BE

1179
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,829
WHAT THIS TRIBE NEEDS TO HELP

1180
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,413
TURN THINGS AROUND?

1181
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:27,542
UM, I DEFINITELY THINK SHE'S

1182
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,918
AN AWESOME PERSON, AMAZING

1183
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:31,379
PERSON AND AMAZING SUPERMOM.

1184
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,715
SHE'S VERY... VERY COMPETITIVE

1185
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,758
AND VERY ATHLETIC.

1186
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:36,384
THANK YOU.

1187
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,719
AND SHE CAN KICK SOME ASS.

1188
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,556
Jeff: I SMELL A "BUT"

1189
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,223
COMING.

1190
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,559
SHE CAN BE SEEN AS A THREAT.

1191
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,268
THAT'S THE BUT.

1192
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:46,394
THAT'S THE BUT?

1193
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,271
THAT'S THE BUT.

1194
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,565
BUT TO SAY I'M A THREAT, IT'S

1195
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,274
MORE LIKE I'M TRYING TO HELP THE

1196
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:54,443
TEAM INSTEAD OF TRYING TO GET

1197
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:55,152
MYSELF FURTHER.

1198
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,904
BUT I COULD SEE HOW YOU WOULD

1199
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,907
PERCEIVE ME THAT WAY.

1200
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,284
BUT SHE'S ONE OF THE MOST

1201
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:04,245
HARDEST WORKING WOMEN I'VE EVER

1202
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:04,662
SEEN.

1203
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:05,413
WELL, GOOD.

1204
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:09,417
THAT MAKES ME FEEL HAPPY.

1205
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,210
Jeff: TARZAN, WHAT DO YOU

1206
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,087
MAKE OF THIS NEW TRIBE?

1207
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,589
WAS IT GOOD NEWS FOR YOU?

1208
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:18,259
MY IMMEDIATE RESPONSE WAS TO

1209
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:22,263
DROP MY ASSERTIVENESS TO A

1210
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,097
DIFFERENT LOAD STAR, WHICH IS

1211
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,266
ONE MEMBER OF THIS GROUP WHO

1212
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,101
WOULD THEN LEAD THE FIRST FEW

1213
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:29,228
DAYS OF THIS NEW TRIBE.

1214
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,732
Jeff: SO THAT MEANS... HOLD

1215
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:33,024
ON.

1216
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:33,524
OKAY.

1217
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,609
Jeff: I LOVE THIS.

1218
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,943
IT'S KIND OF A GAME.

1219
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,946
YOU DECIDED TO DROP YOUR

1220
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:39,614
ASSERTIVENESS TO A DIFFERENT

1221
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,365
LODE STAR WHICH IS ONE MEMBER OF

1222
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,575
THIS GROUP.

1223
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:43,784
YES.

1224
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,786
Jeff: AND THAT WOULD BE...

1225
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,330
I SHANT SAY BECAUSE THE GAME

1226
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,581
IS AFOOT.

1227
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:52,084
"I SHANT SAY"?

1228
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:52,793
Jeff: SO YOU'RE NOT GOING

1229
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,587
TO REVEAL BECAUSE WE HERE IN THE

1230
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,004
MIDST OF THE GAME.

1231
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:55,963
YES, SIR.

1232
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:56,631
Jeff: LEIF, DO YOU

1233
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,090
UNDERSTAND WHAT TARZAN SAYS?

1234
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,009
HE'S GOT QUITE A VOCABULARY.

1235
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,969
HE DEFINITELY IS A VERY

1236
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,555
COMPLEX, VERY WISDOM KIND OF GUY

1237
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,139
AND...

1238
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:06,724
Jeff: IS IT HARD EVEN TO

1239
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:07,683
TALK AROUND HIM?

1240
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:08,476
DO YOU FIND YOURSELF SAYING "I

1241
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,519
NEED BETTER WORDS THAN OKAY"?

1242
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,773
YEAH, HE DEFINITELY HAS A LOT

1243
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,524
OF BIG WORDS THAT I CAN KIND OF

1244
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:19,070
COMPREHEND BUT HE ALSO HELPS

1245
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,696
BETTER EXPLAINATE...

1246
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,115
Jeff: SEE, BETTER

1247
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:23,866
EXPLAINATE, NOT A WORD.

1248
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,117
AND WHAT HE SAID IS A NEO-LOW

1249
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:25,660
JIM.

1250
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,994
Jeff: WHICH IS WHAT?

1251
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:27,662
MAKING UP THE WORD THAT

1252
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,789
SOUNDS SIMILAR TO THE WORD YOU

1253
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:30,331
MEAN TO SAY.

1254
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,666
Jeff: AWESOME.

1255
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,501
IT'S IMPRESSIVE, YOUR

1256
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:34,210
VOCABULARY.

1257
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,753
NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THAT.

1258
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:36,504
THANK YOU.

1259
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,547
Jeff: BUT THE NEED TO SHARE

1260
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,341
IT AND THE NEED TO BE HEARD CAN

1261
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,509
BE DISRUPTIVE.

1262
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,177
DO YOU EVER SENSE THAT?

1263
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,804
WELL, IN MY OWN ENVIRONMENT

1264
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:45,805
IT'S A THING WE DO.

1265
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,556
WE TRY TO BE VERY, VERY PRECISE.

1266
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,850
Jeff: WHAT IS YOUR WORLD?

1267
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,686
WHAT HAVE YOUR SHARED WITH YOUR

1268
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:52,561
GROUP ABOUT YOUR WORLD?

1269
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,981
THE GAME IS AFOOT, JEFF.

1270
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,649
Jeff: SO THAT REMAINS A

1271
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:56,941
MYSTERY?

1272
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:57,525
YEAH.

1273
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,818
Jeff: I KNOW YOU HAVE 14

1274
00:37:58,901 --> 00:37:59,277
PETS.

1275
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,736
I HAVE 14 PETS.

1276
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,988
I'M A MEDIC.

1277
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,489
A WIFE NAMED TERRY.

1278
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:03,948
I COLLECT BUGS.

1279
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:06,158
HE HAS APHAGIA.

1280
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:06,784
YES.

1281
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:09,829
Jeff: I NEED A DICTIONARY.

1282
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:12,873
I HAVE A NOMINAL APHAGIA.

1283
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,001
IT'S A SPECIFIC APHAGIA FOR

1284
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,877
PEOPLE'S NAMES THAT I HAVE HAD

1285
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,212
ALL MY LIFE.

1286
00:38:18,295 --> 00:38:20,214
I CAN'T REMEMBER A PERSON'S

1287
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:20,881
NAME.

1288
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,258
IT'S CALLED NOMINAL APHAGIA.

1289
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,718
Jeff: DO YOU KNOW THE NAMES

1290
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,011
OF YOUR TRIBE MEMBERS?

1291
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:25,302
I.

1292
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,679
I... DO?

1293
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:27,096
(LAUGHS).

1294
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,056
Jeff: LET'S SEE.

1295
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,016
OKAY, TARZAN.

1296
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,392
(LAUGHS)

1297
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:38,941
ALICIA, LEIF, COLTON, GOSH, CAN

1298
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:42,778
YOU BELIEVE IT?

1299
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:46,991
UM...... MONICA.

1300
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:50,578
CHRISTINA... UM... DON'T SAY IT!

1301
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,789
STARTS WITH A "J."

1302
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,666
JONAS.

1303
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,751
THAT'S IT.

1304
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,211
Jeff: TARZAN, JUST SO I'M

1305
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,421
CLEAR, YOU WEREN'T PUTTING ME

1306
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,255
ON, YOU WERE STRUGGLING.

1307
00:39:01,338 --> 00:39:01,881
YEAH.

1308
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:02,590
Jeff: AND HAD MONICA NOT

1309
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:03,632
GIVEN YOU THE FIRST LETTER, WE

1310
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:04,425
MIGHT STILL BE HERE.

1311
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,927
POSSIBLY, IF YOU WAITED THAT

1312
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:07,261
LONG.

1313
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:08,387
(LAUGHS).

1314
