-Anything new?
-Um, yeah.

645
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,406
So, there's basically
one group saying...

saying the Nick or Michele.

647
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,868
Then a different group
that wants to go Sarah.

648
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,329
Oh, my God.

649
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,247

-Okay. I'm fine with it

-Okay.

652
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,505
-Okay.
-Right?

653
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,549
They came to me.

654
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:17,927
Adam was the only one
that could convince everybody

655
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,888
to go with the Sarah direction.

656
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:23,725
So I'm thinking Adam,
if he has that type of power

657
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,561
to be able to control people
like that and say--

658
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:29,022
put his foot down
and people listen,

659
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,857
we should plop it all on him.

660
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,609
<i>We agree to Sarah,</i>

661
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,903
<i>but I think Adam's</i>
<i>more dangerous as a player.</i>

662
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,071
<i>So I think,</i>

663
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:39,032
"Okay, I have to do something."

664
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:40,825

00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,403
<i>SARAH:</i>
<i>Literally, a bomb went off</i>

680
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,071
when my name came out
of someone's mouth,

681
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:21,116
and now I'm like, "Hold up."

682
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,451
<i>This is not happening.</i>

683
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,620
<i>Adam, you threw my name out.</i>

684
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,414
Mistake, brother.

685
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,998
You don't throw my name out,
okay?

686
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,584
<i>And you're gonna learn</i>
<i>the hard way,</i>

687
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,795
<i>and you're gonna learn why</i>
<i>you don't throw my name out,</i>

688
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,422
because your ass
is gonna go home.

689
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,592
-Really?
-Yeah. So...

690
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,261
<i>BEN:</i>
<i>It's hard to rope</i>
<i>a bunch of winners</i>

691
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,805
<i>into a single direction.</i>

692
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,014
The group's decision
has changed today.

693
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,643
I think the group's decision
will change more times today.

694
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:50,019
I think the group's decision

695
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:50,979
will probably change
at Tribal tonight, too.

696
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,606
So...

697
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,984
<i>I just hope the target</i>
<i>doesn't end up on me tonight.</i>

698
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,445
Who said that me and Sarah
were too close?

699
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,447
-A lot of people have said that.
-Like who?

700
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,030
-Like, everybody.
-Like who?

701
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,950
-Like...
-Did you say it?

702
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,995
-I-I've been in part...
-You did say that?

703
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,830
No, I didn't say it,
but I've been...

704
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,165
-I've heard people say it.
-Who?

705
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,167
Ben, it doesn't matter.

706
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,376
-It does matter.
-Why does it matter?

707
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,129
-Because people are telling me
it was you. Cool.
-No.

708
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,006
-Ben. Ben, it doesn't matter.
-No, fine. All I needed to know.

709
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,632
-That's fine. It does matter.
-It doesn't matter.

710
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:20,925
It matters to me, okay?
So, that's all I need to know.

711
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,553
If you don't want to tell me it,
that's your prerogative.

712
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,305
I'm glad we had
this conversation.

713
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,223
Okay? But if you don't want

714
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,017
-to tell me, that's fine.
-You're gonna f...

715
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,352
-force me to tell you.
-No, I'm not forcing you
to do anything.

716
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,021
You... I just...
That's why I'm walking away.

717
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,190
'Cause I'm not gonna stay here
and, like, try to force you.

718
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,691
If you don't want to tell me,
that's fine.

719
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:38,026
-I'll tell. I'll tell.
-No.

720
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,819
-I'll tell you.
-I don't need to know.

721
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,863
<i>ADAM:</i>
<i>Ben talks to me</i>

<i>that needs to be scolded.</i>

723
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,659
You know, he plays
a lot more like Boston Rob

724
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,036
than he would ever
want to admit.

725
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,580
This is madness.

Then all hell breaks loose.

729
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:02,050
Have you heard
my name at all yet today?

730
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,593
-Yes.
-Really?

731
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:05,678
I've heard so many plans today.

732
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:06,846
-Do you know what I heard, Tony?
-TONY: What?

733
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,680
Is that you're the one
that said...

734
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,682
-threw my name under the bus.
-No!

737
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,062
Same plan. Sarah.

00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,606
-Who are we voting for?
-Adam.

Yeah.

-Sarah?

-Yeah. Sarah.
-Okay.

00:30:23,821 --> 00:30:25,031
I feel like every time
we decide something,

745
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,950
I see everybody go off
and talk more.

746
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,869
Tyson told Sarah it was her?

747
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,079
Yeah.

748
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,539
I'm afraid he's going for me

749
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,374
because he keeps telling
everybody different ....

750
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,709
I wouldn't mind writing Tyson.

751
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,920
She just told me to write Tyson.

752
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,171

00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,050

-Tyson?

00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,094
-Let's do Sarah.
-Sarah.

-I honestly don't know.
-Oh, my God.

All right.

774
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:07,133
Sarah, this has been,
thus far, a very cagey game

775
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:10,345
of cat and mouse,
where nobody says anything

776
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,472
and then there's
another blindside.

777
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:13,348
What did you see
happening today?

778
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:17,310
Um, it's definitely
not cagey anymore.

779
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,145
It was chaotic.

780
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:22,231
Everybody's name
seems to appear.

781
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:25,860
People that you're working with,
they're throwing your name out.

782
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:28,655
I mean, it's kind of like
a solo game right now.

783
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,990
Tyson, I was gonna go
down the road thinking you guys

784
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,367
weren't gonna talk
about anything.

785
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,827
And Sarah says, "Oh, no, it was
the Wild, Wild West today."

786
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,204
TYSON:
Yeah. It was a game

787
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,039
of running in circles,
meeting back around,

788
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,708
meeting in camp,
pulling people aside.

789
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,377
-Really?
-For sure.

790
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,836
JEREMY:
Jeff, it was like

791
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,672
on one side of the highway,
you see a fire.

792
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,758
And then the wind picks it up,
whips it across the other side

793
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,259
of the highway
and explodes. Boom.

794
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:53,721
It was crazy. I played this game
three times, Jeff.

795
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,598
I've never seen it
like this today.

797
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,893
DENISE:
Jeff, oh, my God. It's like

798
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:00,561
so many names are getting
thrown out, and so you're saying

799
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,188
yes to this plan and yes to that
plan and yes to another plan.

800
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:05,316
And you can't
keep them straight.

801
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,277
And all I can tell you is
I aged a few years today.

802
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,737
PROBST:
Nick, day 23.

803
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,739
Why this Tribal
does it break open?

804
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:15,076
I think what's happened is there
are some "easy" votes here.

805
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,870
I guess it's me or Tyson
or Adam, and now today,

806
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,747
other names come up,
and then all of a sudden,

807
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,416
all hell breaks loose.

808
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,208
But I'm tired
of my name coming up.

809
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,252
I was blindsided last time.

810
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,878
I feel like
I'm not being treated

811
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,631
like a player in this game,
and I'm ready to join somebody.

812
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,425
Make a push.
If this is<i> Winners at War,</i>

813
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,259
this is the saddest war
I've ever seen.

814
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:34,595
Everybody's afraid
to say anything.

815
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,972
Everybody's afraid to
say a name,

816
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,140
and everybody's afraid
to go after anybody, so...

817
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,225
Let's fight. I'm ready.

818
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,436
PROBST:
So, Adam,

819
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,605
if you believe
that in this moment in the game,

820
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,942
you are an "easy" vote,
that means you have to be

821
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:49,277
in some sort of
constant state of

822
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,655
assessing and trying
to make sure

823
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,323
where the vote's going.
What do you do?

824
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,992
ADAM:
Sorry.

825
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,160
-Yeah.
-I'm just trying
to pay attention

826
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,786
-to everything that's...
-Do your thing, man.

827
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,912
...that's going on.

828
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,918
(whispering)

829
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,173
-No.
-Okay.

830
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,133
I'm good.

831
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,676
-Everything's good.
-I'm good.

832
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,137
Let's do it. I'm good.
I'm good. I'm good.

833
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,805
I'm good.

834
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:18,931
What's going on, man?

835
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:27,857
Whispers at Tribal
get attention, Ben.

836
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,192
BEN:
As they should.

837
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,319
It's kind of like what happened
at camp today.

838
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,361
Everyone whispered,
and someone heard a name,

839
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,947
and then it was like,
"Oh, heck no!"

840
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,493
There was feuds
that were brought up

841
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,453
and then extinguished
and then brought up

842
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:43,956
and then extinguished
and things that were addressed.

843
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,209
And it's still happening
right now as we speak, Jeff.

844
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,461
ADAM:
Look, all I know is,

845
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:51,464
when we left camp,
Ben would not talk to me

846
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,007
or look me in the eye,
and I'm concerned...

847
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,008
Did I ask you a question?

848
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:55,718
I'm concerned that maybe
you're voting for me.

849
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:59,013
I-I asked him a question,
and he chose not to answer it.

850
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:01,516
And that was on him.
And so I turned and walked away,

851
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,519
because a fair
and honest question

852
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,562
by an alliance member
should be answered.

853
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:07,563
-So I was concerned...
-Not if it means

854
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,732
having to throw somebody else
under the bus.

855
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:12,151

throwing me under the bus.

856
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,861
-I was not.
-Okay.

857
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:17,323

this roundabout has gone.

859

860

-Have you? Have you?

861
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,206
-Yes. Have you gone home?
-Why did Wendell vote for me

862
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,542
at the last Tribal Council?

863
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,418
Why did Nick vote for me
at the last Tribal Council?

864
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:30,378
Is it maybe because you said

865
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,506
I was causing chaos
at the Yara camp?

866
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:34,966

872

873

so sensitive, Ben.
-Okay, Adam.

-But if I feel like

881
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,620
you're the reason
that votes are coming my way...

882
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,455

If you got to tell yourself
that I'm the reason for that,

883
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,541
-that's fine.
-I<i> still</i> wasn't
coming after you.

-ADAM: What I did

-at Sele was I told Rob...
-Rob.

886
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,047
...what was gonna happen
because I was loyal to Rob.

887
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,924
Rob said he would never
write my name down.

888
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,759
-And you had an alliance
with Jeremy and I, too.
-I've explained this many times.

-Right?
-And have I written
your name down?

890

-And have I ever caused anybody
to write your name down?
-And have...
