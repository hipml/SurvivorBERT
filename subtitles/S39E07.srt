1
00:00:11,413 --> 00:00:12,758
I'M SCARED.

2
00:00:12,793 --> 00:00:14,448
NOW IT'S DOG-EAT-DOG.

3
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:27,689
I THINK WE'RE DOING THIS.

4
00:00:27,724 --> 00:00:32,379
AT TRIBAL, I BLOCKED JASON'S
VOTE, AND JASON WENT HOME.

5
00:00:32,413 --> 00:00:35,965
I DIDN'T KNOW THINGS WOULD SHAKE
OUT LIKE THAT.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I KNEW THE OLD VOKAI WOULD HAVE
SOUR GRAPES AND BE BUTT HURT.

7
00:00:40,034 --> 00:00:43,344
IT'S WHAT I HAD TO DO FOR ME AND
MY CORE.

8
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:44,448
NOW THEY'RE SHAKING IN THEIR
SHOES BECAUSE WE'RE UP ON

9
00:00:44,482 --> 00:00:50,448
NUMBERS.

10
00:00:50,482 --> 00:00:55,034
UNFORTUNATELY TOMMY, DEAN AND
I WERE ON THE OUTSIDE.

11
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:58,586
MISSY AND I HAD HAD BUILT A REAL
CONNECTION, SO I FEEL LIKE I WAS

12
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,275
LIED.

13
00:00:59,310 --> 00:00:59,896
TO.

14
00:00:59,931 --> 00:01:01,103
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

15
00:01:01,137 --> 00:01:03,379
ALL I CAN HOPE IS WE DON'T
LOSE IMMUNITY AND I DON'T GO

16
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:04,275
HOME.

17
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,379
NO GIRL HAS GONE HOME SINCE
THE SWAP.

18
00:01:06,413 --> 00:01:11,896
YOU ARE THE ONLY CONNECTION TO
THE GIRLS ON THE OTHER SIDE.

19
00:01:11,931 --> 00:01:13,896
YOU CAN'T GO HOME.

20
00:01:13,931 --> 00:01:17,965
I WANT TO BELIEVE THAT FROM
YOU.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,103
IT'S HARD TO PUT FAITH AND TRUST
IN PEOPLE WHEN THEY TELL YOU ONE

22
00:01:23,137 --> 00:01:24,482
THING AND DO ANOTHER.

23
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:28,517
SO I HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT IS THE
BEST THING FOR MY GAME.

24
00:01:36,758 --> 00:01:39,275
THIS IS A GAME CHANGER.

25
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,034
GOOD MOVE.

26
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:44,034
THAT'S WHY I DONE IT.

27
00:01:44,068 --> 00:01:47,586
BY TAKING JASON OUT OF THE
GAME, WE PUT THEM ON THEIR

28
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,448
HEELS, AND NOW WE KNOW THEY'RE
GOING TO COME SCRAMBLING BACK,

29
00:01:50,482 --> 00:01:53,896
BEGGING FOR THEIR LIVES, BECAUSE
NOW WHO IS IN CONTROL OVER HERE?

30
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:56,931
WE ARE.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,655
WE'RE GOING TO GET THE FIRE
STARTED.

32
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:33,965
DO YOU HAVE FLINT?

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,517
WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS
THAT?

34
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:39,448
LET'S GET IT GOING THEN.

35
00:02:39,482 --> 00:02:41,137
IT WAS A TERRIBLE NIGHT.

36
00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:45,517
WE HAD TORRENTIAL DOWNPOURS THE
ENTIRE NIGHT.

37
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:48,137
JAMAL TOOK THE LEAD ON WORKING
WITH THE FLINT AND GETTING THE

38
00:02:48,172 --> 00:02:52,172
FIRE STARTED, AN HE TOOK A LOT
OF SHOTS AT IT.

39
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:03,965
I THINK YOU SHOULD TRY FIRE.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,689
WHATEVER.

41
00:03:04,724 --> 00:03:16,275
DOESN'T MATTER.

42
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:24,965
YOU'RE WELCOME TO DO IT.

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,034
SO I TAKE THE MAGNESIUM, AND
JAMAL BASICALLY STARTS TELLING

44
00:03:28,068 --> 00:03:29,034
ME WHAT TO DO.

45
00:03:29,068 --> 00:03:32,827
AND BASICALLY LIKE TAKES IT FROM
ME.

46
00:03:32,862 --> 00:03:37,517
AND I'M LIKE PISSED OFF.

47
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:38,931
AM I OUT OF LINE?

48
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:40,896
I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE LET
HER TRY.

49
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:44,724
LIKE I GET REALLY IMPATIENT
WITH INCOMPETENCE, ESPECIALLY

50
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,862
WHEN I HAVE NO FOOD AND I
HAVEN'T GOTTEN SLEEP.

51
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:50,689
IT JUST GOT TO ME AND I WAS
LIKE, OH, MY GOD, LIKE YOU

52
00:03:50,724 --> 00:03:54,379
AREN'T GOOD AT THIS, LET SOMEONE
ELSE GIVE IT A TRY WHO KNOWS

53
00:03:54,413 --> 00:03:54,896
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

54
00:03:54,931 --> 00:03:55,517
WOW.

55
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:56,965
THERE YOU GO.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,517
HE SAYS THINGS LIKE IT'S MY WAY
OR THE HIGHWAY, AND WHETHER IT'S

57
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:03,034
DOING STUFF AROUND CAMP OR
STRATEGY, I THINK HE'S JUST A

58
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:08,068
TOUGH PERSON TO WORK WITH.

59
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,655
THE PORTIONS CAME OUT SMALLER
WITH LESS WATER.

60
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:21,551
NO, THE PORTION IS SMALLER
BECAUSE IT STARTED OFF SMALLER.

61
00:04:21,586 --> 00:04:22,931
OKAY, THAT, TOO.

62
00:04:22,965 --> 00:04:23,862
OKAY, GOT IT.

63
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,241
BUT IN HERE IT'S DEFINITELY
BARELY A CUP.

64
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:28,586
I'LL GIVE YOU SOME OF MINE.

65
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,379
BECAUSE YOU HAVE RICE IN YOUR
HAND.

66
00:04:30,413 --> 00:04:34,482
NO, I PUT IT FLAT IN THIS.

67
00:04:34,517 --> 00:04:37,034
I GO, I THINK THERE'S A
PROBLEM.

68
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:41,000
THERE'S ONLY ONE SCOOP LEFT IN
THE BOWL, AND JAMAL, HE LOCKS AT

69
00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:45,896
ME AND GOES, IT'S BECAUSE YOU
HAVE A HEAPING PORTION ON THAT

70
00:04:45,931 --> 00:04:50,896
SHELL OF YOURS AND I'M LIKE,
YOU'RE A COMPLETE -YOU HAVE

71
00:04:50,931 --> 00:04:55,275
THE AUDACITY TO TELL ME THERE'S
NOT ENOUGH IN THE POT BECAUSE

72
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,103
NOURA HAD TOO MUCH.

73
00:04:56,137 --> 00:04:57,517
I HATE JAMAL.

74
00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:59,103
I'M SO OVER HIM.

75
00:04:59,137 --> 00:05:00,206
I'M OVER HIS FACE.

76
00:05:00,241 --> 00:05:03,517
I'M OVER HIS REPRESSIVE REMARKS.

77
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:07,896
AT WHAT POINT DO WE NOT KEEP
COWERING DOWN TO THINGS LIKE

78
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:09,172
THAT?

79
00:05:09,206 --> 00:05:11,241
AT WHAT POINT DO YOU SAY, LET'S
BRECK AWAY AND CUT HIS THROAT

80
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:12,137
OFF.

81
00:05:12,172 --> 00:05:13,862
I'M GOING TO PLAY THE WOMAN
CARD HERE.

82
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:17,034
WE ARE STRONG, SMART,
INDEPENDENT WOMEN, AND WHAT

83
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:20,689
POINT IN THE GAME DO WE START
HAVING OUR OWN GAME, LIKE --

84
00:05:20,724 --> 00:05:22,344
WHEN WE GET TO THE MERGE.

85
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:25,344
YOU DON'T EVEN FEEL LIKE IT'S
WORTH TRYING TO GET HIM OUT

86
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:26,172
BEFORE?

87
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:27,448
I THINK IT WOULD BE TOO
DANGEROUS.

88
00:05:27,482 --> 00:05:29,827
I THINK WE NEED TO WAIT UNTIL WE
GET TO THE MERGE.

89
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:36,068
NOURA IS ALL ABOUT A GIRL'S
ALLIANCE, PRO WOMEN, RAH, RAH,

90
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:38,068
RAH, AND WE'RE NOT DOING THAT.

91
00:05:38,103 --> 00:05:39,413
HONESTLY, I DON'T TRUST DEAN.

92
00:05:39,448 --> 00:05:40,172
YOU DON'T?

93
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,413
I DON'T.

94
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:44,724
THE PLAN AS OF RIGHT NOW ON
THE NEXT VOTE IS DEAN BECAUSE

95
00:05:44,758 --> 00:05:47,068
HESS A PRETTY BOY, HE'S ALL
ABOUT HIMSELF.

96
00:05:47,103 --> 00:05:49,551
I'M SO HAPPY I FOUND YOU GUYS
THE PLAY.

97
00:05:49,586 --> 00:05:51,689
WITH YOU GUYS ARE MAKING MY
"SURVIVOR" DREAM COME TRUE.

98
00:05:51,724 --> 00:05:52,862
WOW.

99
00:05:52,896 --> 00:05:55,862
AND KARISHMA WILL BE A LOYAL
VOTE BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN

100
00:05:55,896 --> 00:05:57,896
OSTRACIZED BY OUR OLD TRIBE.

101
00:05:57,931 --> 00:06:05,620
IT'S MATTER OF KEEPING NOURA'S
HEAD WITH US.

102
00:06:05,655 --> 00:06:07,655
LET'S SEE WHAT THIS IT WILL
BOAT MAN HAS TO SAY.

103
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:09,931
WE SEE A BOAT.

104
00:06:09,965 --> 00:06:11,034
I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

105
00:06:11,068 --> 00:06:13,103
SOMEONE IS GOING TO ISLAND OF
THE IDOLS.

106
00:06:13,137 --> 00:06:16,517
JANET MUST GET ON THE BOAT
AND HEAD TO THE ISLAND OF THE

107
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:17,620
IDOLS.

108
00:06:17,655 --> 00:06:19,827
JANET, PRESS HER HEART,
DOESN'T TAKE IT VERY WELL.

109
00:06:19,862 --> 00:06:20,931
I'M SCARED.

110
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:22,482
DON'T BE SCARED.

111
00:06:22,517 --> 00:06:26,758
FORTUNATELY I HAVE FAITH THAT
SHE WILL DO THE RIGHT THING FOR

112
00:06:26,793 --> 00:06:28,793
THE TRIBE.

113
00:06:28,827 --> 00:06:41,241
AND OUR ALLIANCE.

114
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,931
MY STOMACH IS DOING
FLIP-FLOPS.

115
00:06:43,965 --> 00:06:47,310
EVERYTHING IS CALLING R CRAWLING
UP IN MY THROAT.

116
00:06:47,344 --> 00:06:50,310
BECAUSE GOING TO THE ISLAND OF
THE IDOLS HAS PUT A TARGETED ON

117
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:59,827
PEOPLE'S BACKS.

118
00:06:59,862 --> 00:07:01,965
I DID NOT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN TO
ME.

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,586
I'M SILTING IN A GOOD SPOT.

120
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,379
OH, MY GOD.

121
00:07:08,413 --> 00:07:10,000
OH, MY GOD!

122
00:07:10,034 --> 00:07:11,103
OH OH, MY GOD!

123
00:07:11,137 --> 00:07:12,206
COME ON IN.

124
00:07:12,241 --> 00:07:15,103
WELCOME, COME ON.

125
00:07:15,137 --> 00:07:17,586
IT ANSWERS SO MANY QUESTIONS.

126
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:24,068
THE ISLAND OF THE IDOL, THEY ARE
THE SUPERSTAR SURVIVOR IDOLS.

127
00:07:24,103 --> 00:07:25,000
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

128
00:07:25,034 --> 00:07:26,206
JANET, I'M ROB.

129
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:27,344
I KNOW.

130
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:32,344
JANET, COME IN AND WE'LL
EXPLAIN EVERYTHING, OKAY?

131
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:33,137
YOU OKAY?

132
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:33,862
YEAH.

133
00:07:33,896 --> 00:07:35,275
THIS IS A BIG MOMENT FOR ME.

134
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,000
THIS COULD BE A TURNING POINT IN
MY GAME.

135
00:07:38,034 --> 00:07:42,551
I WAS IS SCARED THAT I HAD TO GO
TO THE ISLAND OF THE IDOLS.

136
00:07:42,586 --> 00:07:46,551
USUALLY THAT'S LIKE HUGE TARGET
ON YOUR BACK, BUT MY TRIBE, THEY

137
00:07:46,586 --> 00:07:47,275
TRUST ME.

138
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,517
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

139
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:53,034
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE IN A
PRETTY GOOD SPOT RIGHT NOW.

140
00:07:53,068 --> 00:07:54,137
I AM.

141
00:07:54,172 --> 00:08:01,448
BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO
THINK BEYOND RIGHT NOW.

142
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:04,034
THE BETTER PLAYERS THINK TWO OR
THREE MOVES AHEAD.

143
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:05,517
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO.

144
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,758
LET ME EXPLAIN HOW IT WORKS.

145
00:08:07,793 --> 00:08:11,448
EVERYBODY WHO COMES HERE GETS A
LESSON, AND TODAY'S LESSON IS

146
00:08:11,482 --> 00:08:13,758
ABOUT CALCULATED RISK.

147
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:19,172
SO IN "SURVIVOR," THERE ARE
COUNTLESS OPPORTUNITIES TO APPLY

148
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:23,241
THIS COME COLLATED RISK.

149
00:08:23,275 --> 00:08:25,965
YOU DON'T MAKE MOVES IN THIS
GAME WITHOUT KNOWING WHY YOU DO

150
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,241
IT.

151
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:30,793
TONIGHT I AM OFFERING UP MY
IMMUNITY NECKLACE, AND I WILL BE

152
00:08:30,827 --> 00:08:33,896
MAKING FIRE AGAINST RICK DEVENS.

153
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:37,862
THE POINT OF THIS ENTIRE
LESSON IS ABOUT CALCULATING

154
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:38,655
RISK.

155
00:08:38,689 --> 00:08:40,517
IT'S THE BIGGEST RISK
I'MCATION.

156
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:41,724
WOW.

157
00:08:41,758 --> 00:08:46,517
THE MINUTE YOU STOP ANALYZE,
THAT'S THE MINUTE YOU FALL

158
00:08:46,551 --> 00:08:47,758
ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL AND YOUR
GONE.

159
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:52,586
THE WINNER OF

160
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,586
"SURVIVOR: EDGE OF EXTINCTION"
CHRIS!

161
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,896
IF YOUR BACK IS AGAINST THE
WALL, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO THIS

162
00:08:57,931 --> 00:08:59,379
SOMETHING THAT YOU NORMALLY
WOULDN'T DO.

163
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:02,034
SO TODAY WE'RE GOING THE PLAY A
LITTLE GAME.

164
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:07,862
THIS GAME WILL HELP YOU TO START
TO UNDERSTAND CALCULATED RISK.

165
00:09:07,896 --> 00:09:10,413
IT'S A RISK VERSUS REWARD GAME.

166
00:09:10,448 --> 00:09:13,517
JUST LIKE IN SURVIVOR, THE
GREATER THE REWARD, THE HIGHER

167
00:09:13,551 --> 00:09:15,172
THE RISK.

168
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:22,758
IF YOU WIN, YOU EARN A SAFETY
WITHOUT POWER ADVANTAGE.

169
00:09:22,793 --> 00:09:27,482
THIS ADVANTAGE PROTECTS YOU FROM
BEING VOTED OUT AT ONE TRIBAL

170
00:09:27,517 --> 00:09:28,724
COUNCIL.

171
00:09:28,758 --> 00:09:31,620
YOU WILL LEAVE TRIBAL COUNCIL
BEFORE THE VOTE AND RETURN TO

172
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:32,379
CAMP.

173
00:09:32,413 --> 00:09:34,206
SO YOU CAN'T BE VOTED OUT.

174
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:37,793
THE LAST TIME YOU CAN USE IT IS
WHEN THERE ARE SEVEN PLAYERS

175
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,482
LEFT IN THE GAME.

176
00:09:39,517 --> 00:09:43,517
BUT IF YOU LOSE THE GAME, YOU
LOSE YOUR VOTE AT THE NEXT

177
00:09:43,551 --> 00:09:46,586
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

178
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,103
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

179
00:09:50,137 --> 00:09:52,517
DO YOU WANT TO PLAY THE GAME, OR
DO YOU WANT THE PLAY IT SAFE AND

180
00:09:52,551 --> 00:10:01,206
RETURN TO CAMP?

181
00:10:01,241 --> 00:10:07,724
LET'S SAY I WIN AND I WALK
AWAY BEFORE THE VOTE, KEENING ME

182
00:10:07,758 --> 00:10:12,034
SAFE, BUT DOES THAT PUT A BIGGER
TARGET ON ME AT THE NEXT TRIBAL

183
00:10:12,068 --> 00:10:14,275
COUNCIL?

184
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:19,862
BECAUSE I COULD POTENTIALLY BE
SCREWING MY ALLIANCE AND NOT GET

185
00:10:19,896 --> 00:10:23,655
THE PERSON OUT THAT I AGREE ON,
BUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT IS I

186
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:28,000
COULD GET VOTED OUT.

187
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:37,965
I'M GOING TO NOT PLAY.

188
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,413
WHY?

189
00:10:40,448 --> 00:10:45,172
BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD PUT
A BIGGER TARGET ON ME IF I LEFT

190
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:48,931
A TRIBAL COUNCIL FOR THE
FOLLOWING TRIBAL.

191
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:53,551
I'M SMILING, BECAUSE YOU
REALLY UNDERSTOOD THIS LESSON.

192
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:58,034
AND I'M REALLY HAPPY AT THE FACT
YOU'RE ABLE TO RUN THE SCENARIO

193
00:10:58,068 --> 00:11:01,793
IN YOUR MIND, CALCULATE THE
RISK, AND MAKE A DECISION.

194
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,413
THAT'S WHAT THIS GAME IS ALL
ABOUT.

195
00:11:04,448 --> 00:11:09,275
SHE WAS FIRST PERSON TO COME
HERE AND JUST SAY NO TO OUR

196
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,517
OFFER.

197
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:12,689
EVERYONE ELSE, THEY WERE JUST
CHOMPING AT THE BIT TO ACCEPT

198
00:11:12,724 --> 00:11:14,310
ANYTHING THAT ROB AND I PUT IN
FRONT OF THEM.

199
00:11:14,344 --> 00:11:15,724
HANG IN THERE.

200
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,931
BYE.

201
00:11:17,965 --> 00:11:20,413
I KEEP SAYING THE WINNER THIS
SEASON WILL BE A FEMALE.

202
00:11:20,448 --> 00:11:22,655
I'M WAITING FOR YOU TO TAKE ME
UP AT THAT BET.

203
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:24,034
I'M NOT CRAZY.

204
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:26,586
I WAS BEEN AT NIGHT BUT NOT LAST
NIGHT.

205
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,137
JANUARY SET A VERY LOGICAL
PLAYER.

206
00:11:29,172 --> 00:11:30,034
SHE HAS WISDOM.

207
00:11:30,068 --> 00:11:30,827
SHE HAS AGE.

208
00:11:30,862 --> 00:11:32,620
SHE'S DONE THIS FOR YEARS
ALREADY.

209
00:11:32,655 --> 00:11:38,379
SO RIGHT THERE IT TELLS ME THAT
HER LONGEVITY IN THIS GAME,

210
00:11:38,413 --> 00:11:41,172
SHE'S GOT THE MAKINGS OF A
WINNER.

211
00:11:41,206 --> 00:11:44,206
WE NEED AN OLDER WINNER.

212
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:56,275
JANET'S HERE.

213
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,655
JANET!

214
00:11:57,689 --> 00:11:59,137
IS SHE CRYING OR HAPPY?

215
00:11:59,172 --> 00:12:00,551
SHE'S GOT THUMBS-UP.

216
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:01,068
THAT'S GOOD.

217
00:12:01,103 --> 00:12:07,206
SHOW US THE IDOL.

218
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:11,551
JANET FLASHES HER FRONT TO

219
00:12:11,586 --> 00:12:14,517
CONFIRM I'VE GOT NOTHING ON ME,
BUT SHE'S ALSO LIKE A FREE WOMAN

220
00:12:14,551 --> 00:12:20,241
AND A FREE SPIRIT AND SHE'S
LIKES BEING NAKED APPARENTLY.

221
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:24,448
IT'S ALWAYS A LITTLE
NERVE-RACKING BECAUSE I NEED

222
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:27,034
THEIR STORY TO BE CONSISTENT
WITH MINE.

223
00:12:27,068 --> 00:12:31,551
WE'RE HALFWAY THROUGH THE ENTIRE
SEASON OF "SURVIVOR" AND ONLY

224
00:12:31,586 --> 00:12:34,000
THE PEOPLE AT THE ISLAND OF THE
IDOLS SEEM TO KNOW WHAT'S

225
00:12:34,034 --> 00:12:34,620
EXACTLY THERE.

226
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:36,689
SO I GOT TO THE ISLAND.

227
00:12:36,724 --> 00:12:38,275
MINE WAS A GAME OF CHANCES.

228
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:42,862
IT SAID, YOU CAN TAKE A GAME OF
CHANCES, THIS IS 50% CHANCE THAT

229
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:45,344
YOU WOULD WIN AND A 50% CHANCE
THAT YOU WOULD LOSE.

230
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:47,413
I DIDN'T HAVE TO SOLVE ANYTHING.

231
00:12:47,448 --> 00:12:52,034
SO LUCKILY JANET TELLS ALMOST
THE EXACT SAME STORY THAT I TOLD

232
00:12:52,068 --> 00:12:53,310
ABOUT ISLAND OF THE IDOLS.

233
00:12:53,344 --> 00:12:55,689
IF I LOST, THERE WOULD BE A
CONSEQUENCE.

234
00:12:55,724 --> 00:12:59,172
I CHOSE NOT TO PLAY.

235
00:12:59,206 --> 00:13:01,758
WE RESPECT YOUR DECISION.

236
00:13:01,793 --> 00:13:04,689
WHEN PEOPLE COME BACK FROM
THE ISLAND OF THE IDOLS, THEY'RE

237
00:13:04,724 --> 00:13:08,172
IN THIS SECRET CLUB, AND IT WAS
A RELIEF THAT THE SECRET HAS

238
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:12,206
STAYED A SECRET.

239
00:13:42,137 --> 00:13:45,275
LAST NIGHT WAS HE LYING ON
HIS BACK?

240
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:49,310
IT WAS A WILD ANIMAL.

241
00:13:49,344 --> 00:13:51,620
IT WAS A DANGER ZONE.

242
00:13:51,655 --> 00:13:53,724
I FEEL VIOLATED.

243
00:13:53,758 --> 00:13:54,793
OH, GOD.

244
00:13:54,827 --> 00:13:58,275
I MEAN, LAST NIGHT IT WAS.

245
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,275
IS THIS OKAY?

246
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,517
NEW YORK NO, IT WAS --
I WAS LIKE, SURE.

247
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,586
IS THIS OKAY.

248
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,000
BONDING I THINK IS ALMOST
LIKE 95% OF THIS GAME.

249
00:14:08,034 --> 00:14:13,448
AND WE ALL SEEM TO GET ALONG
FINE, BUT THERE ARE SOME PRETTY

250
00:14:13,482 --> 00:14:15,103
WEIRD, UNCOMFORTABLE THINGS.

251
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:18,241
RIGHT NOW IT'S A GAME BETWEEN
DAN, TOMMY AND I.

252
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:19,758
WE'RE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE
NUMBERS.

253
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:24,034
WE ALL KNOW THAT ONE OF US IS
GOING TO HAVE TO GO HOME.

254
00:14:24,068 --> 00:14:26,034
BUT MY NUMBER ONE RIGHT NOW IS
TOMMY.

255
00:14:26,068 --> 00:14:27,310
HE'S LIKE A BROTHER TO ME.

256
00:14:27,344 --> 00:14:29,482
THERE'S THREE CHICKENS.

257
00:14:29,517 --> 00:14:30,482
THERE'S THREE VOKAI.

258
00:14:30,517 --> 00:14:34,862
ONE OF US IS GOING TO HAVE TO
GET CHOPPED.

259
00:14:34,896 --> 00:14:36,172
WHICH ONE?

260
00:14:36,206 --> 00:14:37,034
THAT ONE.

261
00:14:37,068 --> 00:14:39,344
YOU'RE RED LIKE ME.

262
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,241
YOU CAN STAY.

263
00:14:40,275 --> 00:14:44,206
THAT ONE IS BLACK LIKE ME.

264
00:14:44,241 --> 00:14:45,793
DAN IS UNFORTUNATELY THE

265
00:14:45,827 --> 00:14:48,827
PERSON THAT IS GOING TO BE THE
ONE THAT HAS THE TARGET PAINTED

266
00:14:48,862 --> 00:14:58,896
ON HIS BACK, SO RIGHT NOW IT'S
OPERATION SAVE LAURAN AND TOMMY.

267
00:14:58,931 --> 00:14:59,655
OKAY.

268
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:01,137
NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO FREAK
OUT.

269
00:15:01,172 --> 00:15:03,344
NOW IS THE TIME TO GET OUR HEADS
IN THE GAME.

270
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:06,482
THING THAT SCARES ME IS THEY
KNOW YOU ANDRY CLOSE, AND THEY

271
00:15:06,517 --> 00:15:09,241
PROBABLY WANT THE BREAK US UP
BEFORE WE GO TO THE MERGE, SO

272
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,965
NOW WE HAVE TO PUT A PLAN INTO
ACTION THE MAKE SURE THAT

273
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,068
DOESN'T HAPPEN AND TO PAINT DAN
AS A FLIP-FLOPPER.

274
00:15:14,103 --> 00:15:19,379
RIGHT NOW I'M IN A BAD, BAD
SPOT, BECAUSE NOW IT'S

275
00:15:19,413 --> 00:15:20,275
DOG-EAT-DOG.

276
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,586
I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME
BEFORE MERGE.

277
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,068
I KNOW, TOMMY.

278
00:15:23,103 --> 00:15:24,586
I'M NOT LETTING YOU GO HOME.

279
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,758
IT'S OKAY.

280
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:30,655
I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED, BUT
THERE'S GOING TO BE TIMES WHEN I

281
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:34,689
FEEL THE SAME WAY, AND WE HAVE
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE EACH OTHER

282
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:36,655
AND REASSURE EACH OTHER THAT
IT'S GOING TO BE FINE.

283
00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:37,137
YEAH.

284
00:15:37,172 --> 00:15:37,965
OKAY.

285
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,448
SO IT'S TIME TO LIE, CHEAT,
STEAL.

286
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,551
I'LL DO WHATEVER I NEED TO DO TO
MAKE DAN LOOK LIKE A VERY, VERY

287
00:15:44,586 --> 00:15:49,620
SNEAKY PLAYER.

288
00:15:49,655 --> 00:15:55,275
I THINK I GOT AN IDEA.

289
00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:04,034
DAB CAME TO US AND SAID LET'S
VOTE OUT AARON.

290
00:16:04,068 --> 00:16:06,310
THERE ARE ALWAYS PLANS.

291
00:16:06,344 --> 00:16:07,551
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING.

292
00:16:07,586 --> 00:16:08,689
UNFORTUNATELY DAN IS THAT CRACK.

293
00:16:08,724 --> 00:16:10,344
I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.

294
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:14,172
LAURAN AND TOMMY ARE TRYING TO
GET RID OF DAN, BUT LAURAN AND

295
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,793
TOMMY, THEY ARE TIGHT.

296
00:16:15,827 --> 00:16:16,758
SUPER TIGHT.

297
00:16:16,793 --> 00:16:20,689
I DON'T CARE WHICH ONE OF THE
THREE IT IS.

298
00:16:20,724 --> 00:16:22,172
DAN?

299
00:16:22,206 --> 00:16:25,068
TOMMY AND LAURAN ARE CLOSE.

300
00:16:25,103 --> 00:16:28,034
LAURAN CAN PULL THOSE PEOPLE
WITHOUT TOMMY.

301
00:16:28,068 --> 00:16:32,551
IF TOMMY IS GONE, LAURAN IS MORE
LIKELY TO WORK WITH US.

302
00:16:32,586 --> 00:16:34,034
I THINK IT'S BRILLIANT.

303
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:37,172
I THINK WE'RE DOING THIS.

304
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:40,379
LAURAN'S CONNECTION TO TOMMY
IS DANGEROUS.

305
00:16:40,413 --> 00:16:44,068
SO I'M THINKING, TAKE TOMMY AWAY
FROM LAURAN, AND SHE'LL HAVE NO

306
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,448
WHERE ELSE TO GO.

307
00:16:46,482 --> 00:16:48,620
I DON'T WANT LAURAN AND TOMMY TO
BECOME THE SUPERPAIR THAT'S

308
00:16:48,655 --> 00:16:49,862
UNSTOPPABLE.

309
00:16:49,896 --> 00:16:52,827
THAT'S CATASTROPHIC.

310
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:16,103
COME ON IN, GUYS!

311
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:21,137
COME ON IN, GUYS!

312
00:17:21,172 --> 00:17:22,034
ALL RIGHT.

313
00:17:22,068 --> 00:17:24,344
LET'S GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE.

314
00:17:24,379 --> 00:17:25,379
JACK, FIRST THINGS FIRST.

315
00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:28,586
TAKE BACK THE IDOL.

316
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,793
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.

317
00:17:31,827 --> 00:17:34,379
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING THE RACE TO SHOOT COCONUTS

318
00:17:34,413 --> 00:17:35,586
INTO A BASKET.

319
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,310
WHEN THE BASKET BECOMES HEAVY
ENOUGH, IT WILL TRIGGER THE

320
00:17:39,344 --> 00:17:41,862
PUZZLE PIECES TO DROP.

321
00:17:41,896 --> 00:17:46,103
YOU'LL THEN USE THE PIECES TO
SOLVE A VERY LARGE AND HEAVY

322
00:17:46,137 --> 00:17:47,793
SURVIVOR PUZZLE.

323
00:17:47,827 --> 00:17:51,862
FIRST TO FINISH WINS IMMUNITY,
SAFE FROM THE VOTE.

324
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:54,896
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE SEVENTH

325
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:57,344
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

326
00:17:57,379 --> 00:17:58,862
TAKE A MINUTE THE STRATEGIZE.

327
00:17:58,896 --> 00:18:00,137
WE'LL GET STARTED.

328
00:18:00,172 --> 00:18:05,034
LET'S DO IT!

329
00:18:05,068 --> 00:18:06,275
ALL RIGHT.

330
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,379
ANOTHER DAY IN FIJI.

331
00:18:07,413 --> 00:18:10,344
RAINING ONE SECOND, CLEAR THE
NEXT.

332
00:18:10,379 --> 00:18:13,413
ARE SURVIVORS READY?

333
00:18:13,448 --> 00:18:14,724
LET'S GO, MISSY.

334
00:18:14,758 --> 00:18:17,275
YOU HAVE THREE
SHOOTERS ROTATING, TRYING THE

335
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,793
LAND COCONUTS IN YOUR BASKET.

336
00:18:19,827 --> 00:18:21,655
OH, IT'S HEAVY.

337
00:18:21,689 --> 00:18:23,793
IT'S HEAVY, THE HEAVY.

338
00:18:23,827 --> 00:18:25,586
NICE TOSS BY JACK.

339
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,551
TOMMY LANDS ONE.

340
00:18:28,586 --> 00:18:29,172
ELIZABETH TRIES.

341
00:18:29,206 --> 00:18:31,241
SHE SCORES.

342
00:18:31,275 --> 00:18:34,758
EVERYONE THAT DROPS MOVES YOU
CLOSER TO DROPPING THOSE PUT L

343
00:18:34,793 --> 00:18:36,448
PIECES.

344
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:37,103

00:18:41,758 --> 00:18:44,344
GOT TO GET IT HIGHER THERE,
JANET.

349
00:18:44,379 --> 00:18:47,310
THIS SECTION HAS A LEARNING
CONSERVE.

350
00:18:47,344 --> 00:18:51,068
IT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE
COCONUT AND HOW OFTEN YOU CAN

351
00:18:51,103 --> 00:18:54,689
CAN GET IT IN THAT BASKET.

352
00:18:54,724 --> 00:18:55,310
TOMMY WITH ANOTHER.

353
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:56,482

00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:01,448
VOKAI IS ON FIRE.

00:19:01,482 --> 00:19:03,517
VOKAI IN THE LEAD.

357
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:08,551
LAIRO STRUGGLING IN THE
CHALLENGE.

358
00:19:08,586 --> 00:19:09,586
ALL RIGHT, TOMMY.

359
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,551
TOMMY LAUNCHES AGAIN.

360
00:19:10,586 --> 00:19:11,413
HE'S GOOD.

361
00:19:11,448 --> 00:19:12,689
VOKAI INCHING CLOSER.

362
00:19:12,724 --> 00:19:14,068
BIGGER, ELIZABETH.

363
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:18,310
THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT,
ELIZABETH!

364
00:19:18,344 --> 00:19:19,172
THAT MIGHT DO IT.

365
00:19:19,206 --> 00:19:20,448
THERE THEY GO.

366
00:19:20,482 --> 00:19:22,896
VOKAI, YOU'RE DONE.

367
00:19:22,931 --> 00:19:27,413
VOKAI CAN START MOVING THEIR
PUZZLE PIECES.

368
00:19:27,448 --> 00:19:28,310
JACK LAUNCHES AGAIN.

369
00:19:28,344 --> 00:19:29,137
HE'S GOOD.

370
00:19:29,172 --> 00:19:30,310
KILLING IT, JACK.

371
00:19:30,344 --> 00:19:32,344
LOOKING FOR ONE MORE.

372
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,862
YES!

373
00:19:34,896 --> 00:19:36,448
THAT'S GOING TO DO IT.

374
00:19:36,482 --> 00:19:37,517
LAIRO IS GOOD NOW.

375
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,310
GO, GUYS.

376
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,862
START MOVING YOUR
PIECES.

377
00:19:40,896 --> 00:19:41,655
HERE WE GO.

378
00:19:41,689 --> 00:19:44,137
THESE PIECES ARE
HEAVY.

379
00:19:44,172 --> 00:19:47,103
SOME OF YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO
WORK TOGETHER TO MOVE THEM.

380
00:19:47,137 --> 00:19:48,344
THESE PIECES ARE TOUGH.

381
00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:51,793
THEY'RE LARGE.

382
00:19:51,827 --> 00:19:53,137
DEAN ROLLING TWO AT A TIME.

383
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:54,344
NICE WORK.

384
00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:56,448
ELIZABETH AND LAURAN WORKING
TOGETHER.

385
00:19:56,482 --> 00:19:57,310
VOKAI IN THE LEAD.

386
00:19:57,344 --> 00:19:58,068
ALL RIGHT.

387
00:19:58,103 --> 00:19:58,724
LET'S GO.

388
00:19:58,758 --> 00:20:00,310
YOU'RE GOOD, VOKAI!

389
00:20:00,344 --> 00:20:00,931
START ON THE PUZZLE.

390
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:02,034
LET'S GO.

391
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,068
STAND IT UP.

392
00:20:03,103 --> 00:20:06,310
VOKAI, W
LANE.

393
00:20:06,344 --> 00:20:07,689
DAN, AARON AND LAURAN.

394
00:20:07,724 --> 00:20:09,482
THIS IS OUTWIT.

395
00:20:09,517 --> 00:20:11,827
THIS IS ON THE TOP RIGHT.

396
00:20:11,862 --> 00:20:13,137
YOU KNOW THE SYMBOL.

397
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:14,551
IT'S THE LOW GO OF THE SEASON.

398
00:20:14,586 --> 00:20:18,103
THE QUESTION IS HOW QUICKLY CAN
YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE EACH PIECE

399
00:20:18,137 --> 00:20:21,827
GOES AND HOW EFFICIENTLY CAN YOU
GET THOSE PIECES IN THEIR SPOT.

400
00:20:21,862 --> 00:20:23,896
OUTWIN, OUTPLAY, OUTLAST.

401
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,724
LAURAN BARKING OUT
ORDERS FOR VOKAI NOW.

402
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:28,827
SURVIVOR RIGHT THERE.

403
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:32,206
DAN AND AARON, SWITCH YOUR
PIECES.

404
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:33,000
I GOT IT.

405
00:20:33,034 --> 00:20:34,448
HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

406
00:20:34,482 --> 00:20:35,275
LET ME STEP OVER.

407
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,068
LAIRO TRYING TO STAY
IN IT.

408
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:39,103
THAT GOES ON TOP.

409
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,448
MOVE YOUR FOOT.

410
00:20:41,482 --> 00:20:42,793
IMMUNITY ON THE LINE.

411
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:46,034
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO HOME
TONIGHT.

412
00:20:46,068 --> 00:20:46,724
KEEP WORKING.

413
00:20:46,758 --> 00:20:48,448
THIS IS OUTPLAY.

414
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:49,275
OUTWIT, OUTPLAY.

415
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,206
RIGHT THERE.

416
00:20:50,241 --> 00:20:52,862
LAURAN STILL IN
CHARGE FOR VOKAI.

417
00:20:52,896 --> 00:20:55,965
LET'S GO!

418
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,206
LAIRO MAKING UP TIME
NOW.

419
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:02,793
SUDDENLY WE HAVE CHALLENGE.

420
00:21:02,827 --> 00:21:04,620
COME ON, BABY, LET'S GO.

421
00:21:04,655 --> 00:21:06,241
LET'S GO!

422
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:09,034
VOKAI INCHING CLOSER
TO A VICTORY.

423
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:11,758
COME ON, BABY.

424
00:21:11,793 --> 00:21:12,827

425
00:21:12,862 --> 00:21:15,724
LET'S GO!

426
00:21:15,758 --> 00:21:21,655
LET'S GO!

427
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:24,275
JEFF!

428
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:24,758
JEFF!

429
00:21:24,793 --> 00:21:26,758
IT ABLE RIGHT.

430
00:21:26,793 --> 00:21:27,793
RIGHT HERE IS WRONG.

431
00:21:27,827 --> 00:21:28,724
THEY DO NOT.

432
00:21:28,758 --> 00:21:30,482
SOMETHING IS WRONG FOR VOKAI.

433
00:21:30,517 --> 00:21:32,034
THOSE TWO PIECES.

434
00:21:32,068 --> 00:21:33,689
THE TWO SIDE PIECES.

435
00:21:33,724 --> 00:21:35,793
THAT OPENS THE DOOR
FOR LAIRO.

436
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:36,896
COME ON, GUYS.

437
00:21:36,931 --> 00:21:38,344
WE CAN DO THIS.

438
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:39,379
WE CAN DO THIS.

439
00:21:39,413 --> 00:21:40,965
THE MIDDLE ONE.

440
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,620
GET IT OUT OF THE WAY.

441
00:21:43,655 --> 00:21:45,034
THEY'RE TRYING TO
SWAP PIECES.

442
00:21:45,068 --> 00:21:49,241
WILL THAT DO IT.

443
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:52,379
LAIRO MOVING THEIR LAST PIECE.

444
00:21:52,413 --> 00:21:54,413
PUT IT DOWN.

445
00:21:54,448 --> 00:21:56,034
PUT IT DOWN!

446
00:21:56,068 --> 00:21:57,137
ROTATE IT.

447
00:21:57,172 --> 00:21:57,620
ROTATE IT.

448
00:21:57,655 --> 00:21:59,275
WE CAN DO THIS.

449
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,931
JEFF!

450
00:22:00,965 --> 00:22:01,379
JEFF!

451
00:22:01,413 --> 00:22:04,931
JEFF!

452
00:22:04,965 --> 00:22:10,103
VOKAI WINS IMMUNITY.

453
00:22:10,137 --> 00:22:13,551
BY ONE PIECE.

454
00:22:13,586 --> 00:22:16,310
LAIRO WAS SECONDS AWAY.

455
00:22:16,344 --> 00:22:22,551
WOW.

456
00:22:22,586 --> 00:22:23,896
VOKAI IMMUNITY.

457
00:22:23,931 --> 00:22:25,137
NOBODY GOING HOME TONIGHT.

458
00:22:25,172 --> 00:22:27,965
GOOD JOB, LAURAN.

459
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD
BACK TO CAMP.

460
00:22:30,034 --> 00:22:30,758
ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF.

461
00:22:30,793 --> 00:22:33,724
GOOD JOB, Y'ALL.

462
00:22:33,758 --> 00:22:35,689
LAIRO, TRIBAL COUNCIL
TONIGHT.

463
00:22:35,724 --> 00:22:38,034
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE SEVENTH
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

464
00:22:38,068 --> 00:22:39,655
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

465
00:22:39,689 --> 00:22:41,172
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

466
00:22:41,206 --> 00:22:43,413
LAIRO SUCKS.

467
00:22:43,448 --> 00:22:45,862
WE LOST LITERALLY BY A SECOND.

468
00:22:45,896 --> 00:22:48,620
IT'S REALLY BAD, BECAUSE RIGHT
NOW I HAVE THIS IDOL.

469
00:22:48,655 --> 00:22:52,931
I HAVE NOW BEEN TO TWO TRIBALS
AND IT'S ONLY GOOD FOR ONE MORE

470
00:22:52,965 --> 00:22:56,827
TRIBAL, BUT IF OLD VOKAI IS
GOING TO STAY STRONG, I DON'T

471
00:22:56,862 --> 00:22:57,827
THINK I NEED IT.

472
00:22:57,862 --> 00:23:00,724
IT SUCKS TO LET AN IDOL GO TO
WASTE.

473
00:23:08,172 --> 00:23:11,172
WE CAN ONLY DO WHAT WE KNOW IS
SAFE FOR US RIGHT NOW

474
00:23:11,206 --> 00:23:14,172
WE'RE CONSIDERING GETTING RID OF
DEAN BEACUSE HE IS THE MORE

475
00:23:14,206 --> 00:23:16,103
UNKNOWN ONE. AND THAT SUCKS FOR
ME TO SAY BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE

476
00:23:16,137 --> 00:23:19,172
DEAN. SO THE PLAN IS TO
UNANIMOUSLY

477
00:23:19,206 --> 00:23:22,310
VOTE OUT DEAN TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

478
00:23:22,344 --> 00:23:24,206
HE'S HARD THE READ.

479
00:23:24,241 --> 00:23:25,448
HE'S A LITTLE SMARMY.

480
00:23:25,482 --> 00:23:28,827
SO I THINK THAT HAS PEOPLE ON
EDGE AND A SMARTER MOVE TO GET

481
00:23:28,862 --> 00:23:32,241
RID OF THAT THREAT.

482
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:34,344
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS THINKING
FOR TONIGHT'S VOTE?

483
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:38,172
IT'S GOING TO BE DEAN.

484
00:23:38,206 --> 00:23:38,793
I TRUST YOU.

485
00:23:38,827 --> 00:23:40,103
YEP, THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

486
00:23:40,137 --> 00:23:43,724
I BRING MY HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL
TO EVERY SINGLE TRIBAL, BUT THIS

487
00:23:43,758 --> 00:23:47,620
VOTE COMING UP IS PROBABLY THE
SAFEST I HAVE FELT GOING INTO

488
00:23:47,655 --> 00:23:53,103
TRIBAL.

489
00:23:53,137 --> 00:23:55,344
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU HAVE
THE MAJORITY.

490
00:23:55,379 --> 00:23:56,620
CONGRATS FOR MAKING IT TO THE
MERGE.

491
00:23:56,655 --> 00:23:57,793
THANKS.

492
00:23:57,827 --> 00:24:00,000
WHAT WE'RE ALL FEELING IS
THAT THIS IS THE VOTE RIGHT

493
00:24:00,034 --> 00:24:01,206
BEFORE THE MERGE.

494
00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:05,103
THIS VOTE IS GOING TO SOLIDIFY
US TO MOVE FORWARD INTO THE

495
00:24:05,137 --> 00:24:08,482
MERGE, AND NOURA IS HANDFUL, BUT
I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE AN

496
00:24:08,517 --> 00:24:11,620
EMOTIONAL VOTE IN THIS GAME, AND
I DON'T THINK HOW IT MAKES SENSE

497
00:24:11,655 --> 00:24:18,517
TO ANYONE ON THIS TRIBE TO
DEVIATE FROM THIS PLAN.

498
00:24:18,551 --> 00:24:20,448
AM I GOING HOME TONIGHT?

499
00:24:20,482 --> 00:24:22,068
AM I WRITING DOWN NOURA?

500
00:24:22,103 --> 00:24:24,965
NOURA.

501
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,586
SHE'S SUCH A LOOSE CANNON.

502
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,827
I'LL PROBABLY GIVE MY PITCH
AGAIN AT TRIBAL, BUT MOVING

503
00:24:29,862 --> 00:24:32,068
FORWARD, YOU HAVE TO REALIZE,
IT'S A GUY THING.

504
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:34,275
WE HAVE TO TRY TO STICK
TOGETHER, TOO.

505
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:38,655
DEAN IS CONCERNED, OF COURSE,
BUT I DON'T THINK HE EXPECTS TO

506
00:24:38,689 --> 00:24:42,413
GO HOME BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN VERY
FERVENT IN SAYING WE WANT YOU TO

507
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:45,620
WORK WITH THE GUYS, AND NOURA
DOESN'T FIT IN WITH US.

508
00:24:45,655 --> 00:24:46,896
I DEFINITELY WANT TO.

509
00:24:46,931 --> 00:24:50,206
I MEAN, I'M GOING TO OWE YOU MY
ASS.

510
00:24:50,241 --> 00:24:54,413
TONIGHT I THINK IT'S EITHER
ME OR NOURA, BUT IF I'M ON THE

511
00:24:54,448 --> 00:24:58,448
HOT SEAT, THESE ARE GUYS ARE
MAKING IT AWFULLY COMFORTABLE

512
00:24:58,482 --> 00:25:02,758
FOR ME, SO UNLESS THEY'RE RALLY
GOOD POKER FACES, I FEEL OKAY.

513
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:03,620
THEY KNOW NOURA.

514
00:25:03,655 --> 00:25:04,931
THEY KNOW SHE'S INSANE.

515
00:25:04,965 --> 00:25:08,379
I THINK HE'S IN FOR A BIG BLIND
SIDE TONIGHT OR ELSE I'M THE ONE

516
00:25:08,413 --> 00:25:12,413
BEING LAUGHED AT.

517
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,482
WE'RE GUARANTEED THE MERGE.

518
00:25:14,517 --> 00:25:19,517
AFTER THE MERGE YOU CAN BACKSTAB
ME.

519
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:22,655
I WOULD REALLY JUST LIKE THE GET
TO THE MERCHG.

520
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:24,275
BACKSTAB ME AFTER A COUPLE.

521
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,379
THAT'S FINE.

522
00:25:25,413 --> 00:25:26,620
LET'S SHAKE HANDS.

523
00:25:26,655 --> 00:25:30,103
I HAVE THIS IDOL FROM ISLAND
OF THE IDOL, AND IT'S REALLY

524
00:25:30,137 --> 00:25:32,862
ONLY GOOD FOR ONE MORE TRIBAL
COUNCIL THAT I GO TO, AND THAT

525
00:25:32,896 --> 00:25:36,034
TRIBAL IS TONIGHT.

526
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:38,241
RIGHT NOW, THE VOTE IS DEAN.

527
00:25:38,275 --> 00:25:41,689
BUT WE HAVE THIS CONNECTION OF
HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND, WHO IS A

528
00:25:41,724 --> 00:25:44,172
MUTUAL FRIEND, AND I REALLY LIKE
DEAN.

529
00:25:44,206 --> 00:25:46,620
I WANT TO WORK WITH HIM.

530
00:25:46,655 --> 00:25:51,620
AND IDEALLY I DON'T LET THIS
IDOL GO TO WASTE.

531
00:25:51,655 --> 00:25:52,655
OH, MY GOD.

532
00:25:52,689 --> 00:26:04,034
I JUST HAD A MOMENT OF
INSPIRATION.

533
00:26:04,068 --> 00:26:04,620
OKAY.

534
00:26:04,655 --> 00:26:06,344
MOMENT OF INSPIRATION.

535
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:10,655
I THINK I COULD GIVE DEAN THE
IDOL.

536
00:26:10,689 --> 00:26:14,931
CAN I TRUST
DEAN ENOUGH WITH THIS IDOL AND

537
00:26:14,965 --> 00:26:18,827
HE ACTUALLY WRITES DOWN A NAME
THAT I WANT TO GO HOME.

538
00:26:18,862 --> 00:26:22,310
AND ESSENTIALLY IN MY MIND THERE
ARE TWO OPTION, EITHER JACK OR

539
00:26:22,344 --> 00:26:24,551
JAMAL.

540
00:26:24,586 --> 00:26:28,034
JACK, HE'S EXTREMELY GOOD WITH
PEOPLE, VERY EMPATHETIC, SUPER

541
00:26:28,068 --> 00:26:30,482
FUN, AND I KNOW I CAN TRUST HIM.

542
00:26:30,517 --> 00:26:32,103
I'M SO COMMITTED TO YOU.

543
00:26:32,137 --> 00:26:33,068
DITTO.

544
00:26:33,103 --> 00:26:34,310
BEYOND QUESTION.

545
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:35,551
DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT.

546
00:26:35,586 --> 00:26:40,034
BUT IT'S NOT THAT SMART TO
KEEP HIM IN THE GAME WHEN HE'S

547
00:26:40,068 --> 00:26:43,517
SO CONNECTED TO SO MANY PEOPLE.

548
00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:47,482
JAMAL AND I HAVE A HARDER TIME
CONNECTING, AND I TRUST JAMAL

549
00:26:47,517 --> 00:26:48,689
LESS.

550
00:26:48,724 --> 00:26:53,034
JAMAL I THINK ALSO DOES NOT WANT
TO GO TO THE END WITH ME.

551
00:26:53,068 --> 00:26:56,103
SO I'M TRYING TO THINK OF
CREATIVE WAYS TO USE THIS

552
00:26:56,137 --> 00:26:59,137
WITHOUT ANYONE KNOWING THAT I
HAVE AN IDOL, BECAUSE IF ANYONE

553
00:26:59,172 --> 00:27:02,241
FINDS OUT THAT I HAVE AN IDOL,
THEY WILL KNOW I WAS LYING ABOUT

554
00:27:02,275 --> 00:27:05,344
THE ISLAND OF THE IDOLS OR I WAS
LYING TO THEM, SO I WOULD GIVE

555
00:27:05,379 --> 00:27:08,931
DEAN THE IDOL BEFORE TRIBAL.

556
00:27:08,965 --> 00:27:13,034
THE DOWN SIDE RISK IS IF DEAN
WRITES DOWN MY NAME, I'M GOING

557
00:27:13,068 --> 00:27:17,034
TO GO HOME, AND I GO DOWN AS THE
BIGGEST SUCKER IN "SURVIVOR"

558
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:21,551
HISTORY, HOWEVER, IF I CONVINCE
NOURA THAT IF DEAN HAS AN IDOL

559
00:27:21,586 --> 00:27:24,965
SHE'S GOING HOME AND GET NOURA
TO WRITE DOWN JACK OR JAMAL'S

560
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
NAME, THEN I'M A LOT SAFER.

561
00:27:29,034 --> 00:27:33,862
THAT WOULD BE SO BRILLIANT.

562
00:27:33,896 --> 00:27:37,551
I'M TRYING THE TAKE A BIG RISK
AND YET RISK MITIGATE ALL AT THE

563
00:27:37,586 --> 00:27:40,241
SAME TIME.

564
00:27:40,275 --> 00:27:41,758
WE DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME.

565
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,241
WE'RE ABOUT TO GO TO TRIBAL.

566
00:27:43,275 --> 00:27:44,379
YOU'RE THE NEXT VOTE.

567
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:45,344
FROM WHO?

568
00:27:45,379 --> 00:27:48,172
FROM EVERYBODY.

569
00:27:48,206 --> 00:27:48,931
JANET?

570
00:27:48,965 --> 00:27:49,655
EVERYBODY.

571
00:27:49,689 --> 00:27:52,620
EVEN JANET, JAMAL, AND JACK.

572
00:27:52,655 --> 00:27:54,448
YES.

573
00:27:54,482 --> 00:27:55,068
1,000%.

574
00:27:55,103 --> 00:27:56,068
TELL ME YOU HAVE AN IDOL.

575
00:27:56,103 --> 00:27:57,172
I DON'T.

576
00:27:57,206 --> 00:27:59,931
I'M JUST COMPLETELY MIND BLOWN.

577
00:27:59,965 --> 00:28:01,034
THAT'S CRAZY.

578
00:28:01,068 --> 00:28:03,689
LITTLE DID I KNOW, ALL ALONG
THEY WERE COMING FOR ME.

579
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,551
WELL, I HAVE AN IDOL.

580
00:28:05,586 --> 00:28:06,482
DO YOU?

581
00:28:06,517 --> 00:28:08,413
UH-HUH.

582
00:28:08,448 --> 00:28:10,758
AND I AM GOING TO GIVE IT TO
YOU.

583
00:28:10,793 --> 00:28:13,620
WENDELL YOU GIVE AN IDOL TO
SOMEONE AND YOU MAKE SUCH A BIG

584
00:28:13,655 --> 00:28:17,689
MOVE LIKE THAT WITH SOMEONE, IT
WILL AUTOMATICALLY CLI BOND YOU,

585
00:28:17,724 --> 00:28:20,896
AT LEAST FOR A LITTLE BIT HE'S
GOING TO BE LOYAL TO ME.

586
00:28:20,931 --> 00:28:25,551
DO YOU WANT TO PULL SOME
STRINGS.

587
00:28:25,586 --> 00:28:28,275
I THINK WITH EVERY BIG MOVE,
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT

588
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,517
CAN GO WRONG.

589
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:33,413
NOTHING IS FOOLPROOF IN THIS
GAME, BUT IF THIS PLAN GOES OFF

590
00:28:33,448 --> 00:28:36,448
IN THE WAY I HOPE IT GOES OFF,
IT REALLY WILL SHIFT THE COURSE

591
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:37,689
OF THE GAME.

592
00:28:37,724 --> 00:28:41,827
LY LITERALLY BE SETTING OFF AN
ENTIRE STRING OF DOMINOES WITH

593
00:28:41,862 --> 00:28:44,862
THIS MOVE.

594
00:28:51,448 --> 00:29:01,517
♪
♪

595
00:29:01,517 --> 00:29:09,344
♪
♪

596
00:29:09,379 --> 00:29:14,206
LET THE SHOW BEGIN.

597
00:29:14,241 --> 00:29:15,344
ALL RIGHT.

598
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:18,310
SO, KELLEE, IF YOU THINK
"SURVIVOR" IS A NUMBERS GAME,

599
00:29:18,344 --> 00:29:21,724
THEN IS IT FAIR TO SAY IT WOULD
BE A LEAP FOR AN ORIGINAL VOKAI

600
00:29:21,758 --> 00:29:24,965
MEMBER THE SAY, I'M GOING TO GET
RID OF MY TRIBAL ALLIANCES AND

601
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,724
I'M GOING TO PAIR UP WITH LAIRO.

602
00:29:26,758 --> 00:29:28,000
YEAH, DEFINITELY.

603
00:29:28,034 --> 00:29:32,068
I THINK SPEND FIRST 12 DAYS WITH
A GROUP OF PEOPLE MAKES A HUGE

604
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,275
DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF MAKING
BONDS, HOW PEOPLE VOTE.

605
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,517
THAT I THINK MAKES A REALLY,
REALLY BIG DIFFERENCE IN THIS

606
00:29:37,551 --> 00:29:38,413
GAME.

607
00:29:38,448 --> 00:29:39,655
I THINK PEOPLE REALLY
UNDERESTIMATE THAT

608
00:29:39,689 --> 00:29:43,724
I'D ADD ALL THE SUCCESSES
THEY HAD EARLY ON, TOO.

609
00:29:43,758 --> 00:29:46,413
NOURA, YOU ARE
NODDING.

610
00:29:46,448 --> 00:29:50,034
YES, WE ARE A GROUP BASED ON
INDIVIDUAL PARTNERSHIPS.

611
00:29:50,068 --> 00:29:53,034
BECAUSE THOSE PARTNERSHIPS ARE
STRONG, IT'S KEPT US TOGETHER,

612
00:29:53,068 --> 00:29:55,137
AND YOU'RE THINKING, WELL, WHO
IS THIS GUY?

613
00:29:55,172 --> 00:29:56,310
LIKE I DON'T KNOW HIM.

614
00:29:56,344 --> 00:29:59,034
HE BARELY CAN MAKE EYE CONTACT
WITH ME WHEN I TALK TO HIM

615
00:29:59,068 --> 00:30:00,241
SOMETIMES.

616
00:30:00,275 --> 00:30:03,103
AND SO FOR ME, I'M LIKE, AM I
GOING TO TRUST THIS, OR AM I

617
00:30:03,137 --> 00:30:06,724
GOING TO TRUST THIS?

618
00:30:06,758 --> 00:30:10,000
DEAN, THAT SEEMED
PRETTY CLEAR.

619
00:30:10,034 --> 00:30:13,551
I MEAN, WHAT'S WORSE, ME
POTENTIALLY GOING BACK TO A

620
00:30:13,586 --> 00:30:17,448
TRIBE THAT PLIEBDSIDED ME OR
KEEPING SOMEONE AROUND THAT

621
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:22,103
BROUGHT UP ONE OF YOUR FELLOW
VOKAI MEMBERS?

622
00:30:22,137 --> 00:30:24,172
NOURA BRINGING UP JAMAL.

623
00:30:24,206 --> 00:30:25,448
AM I WRONG IN SAYING THAT?

624
00:30:25,482 --> 00:30:26,724
YOU KNOW THAT HAPPENED.

625
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:30,241
IT'S VERY APPARENT THAT WE
ARE BIG PERSONALITY, THE TWO OF

626
00:30:30,275 --> 00:30:30,862
US.

627
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:32,103
THIS IS NOT NEW TO ANYONE.

628
00:30:32,137 --> 00:30:34,965
IT'S DEFINITELY GREAT FOR
SOMEONE LIKE DEAN TO SAY, OKAY,

629
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,482
LET ME CAPITALIZE ON THIS.

630
00:30:36,517 --> 00:30:38,931
AN YOU DID JUST SAY,

631
00:30:38,965 --> 00:30:40,551
YOU HAD NO LOVE FOR DEAN.

632
00:30:40,586 --> 00:30:42,724
THE OPPOSITE OF LOVE ISN'T
HATE.

633
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:43,862
IT'S INDIFFERENCE.

634
00:30:43,896 --> 00:30:47,413
SO IF I MIGHT HATE HIM
SOMETIMES, THAT CAN HAPPEN, YOU

635
00:30:47,448 --> 00:30:51,034
CAN HATE YOUR OWN LOVED ONES,
YOUR OWN FAMILY, BUT IF I HAVE

636
00:30:51,068 --> 00:30:54,724
INDIFFERENCE FOR YOU, THAT'S A
LOT WEAKER THAN ME HATING HIM

637
00:30:54,758 --> 00:30:55,034
SOMETIMES.

638
00:30:55,068 --> 00:30:55,896
WOW.

639
00:30:55,931 --> 00:30:58,241
WOW.

640
00:30:58,275 --> 00:31:01,172
ONE STICKING POINT,
YOU HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET ME

641
00:31:01,206 --> 00:31:02,551
OUT, IS THAT RIGHT?

642
00:31:02,586 --> 00:31:03,793
IS DEAN RIGHT?

643
00:31:03,827 --> 00:31:08,620
LISTEN, DEAN IS DOING AN
EXCELLENT JOB TO DO WHAT HE CAN

644
00:31:08,655 --> 00:31:09,931
TO GET IN BETWEEN US.

645
00:31:09,965 --> 00:31:11,172
THAT'S NOT AN ANSWER.

646
00:31:11,206 --> 00:31:14,034
I'LL TELL YOU, IT'S GONE
THROUGH MY MIND, BUT THE BOTTOM

647
00:31:14,068 --> 00:31:18,068
LINE IS, I PUT WAY MORE EFFORT
INTO MAKING SURE WE CAN BE A

648
00:31:18,103 --> 00:31:21,034
COHESIVE UNIT, WHICH IS WHAT WE
WANT, AND WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE

649
00:31:21,068 --> 00:31:23,931
WE CAN'T TRUST, AS WELL TO, GET
IN THE WAY OF THAT, SO I HAVE

650
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:29,793
BEEN VERY OPEN AND HONEST, AND
THAT'S WHERE I'M AT RIGHT NOW.

651
00:31:29,827 --> 00:31:32,586
JACK, THE ONE THING
ABOUT NOURA BEING SO OPEN IS YOU

652
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,413
CAN TRUST THAT SHE'S GOING TO
TELL YOU WHAT SHE THINKS SO YOU

653
00:31:35,448 --> 00:31:36,551
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING.

654
00:31:36,586 --> 00:31:40,034
YEAH, KNOWING WHAT NOURA
FEELS IS GREAT.

655
00:31:40,068 --> 00:31:42,793
THAT BEING SAID, WHEN YOU GET
INTO A MERGE-TYPE SITUATION, IF

656
00:31:42,827 --> 00:31:47,103
YOU'RE TRYING TO KEEP A SEEN RAT
FROM PEOPLE, OBJECTIVELY IT IS

657
00:31:47,137 --> 00:31:49,965
MARGINALLY SCARY, BUT KELLEE
POINTED OUT, WE HAD A COUPLE

658
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,068
WEEKS TOGETHER TO DEVELOP MORE
TRUST WITH NOURA, SO I'M LEANING

659
00:31:54,103 --> 00:31:57,655
STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF NOURA,
BECAUSE I THINK IT BENEFITS MY

660
00:31:57,689 --> 00:32:00,655
GAME THE WAY THAT SHE IS ABLE TO
HAVE MY BACK.

661
00:32:00,689 --> 00:32:02,000
THANKS.

662
00:32:02,034 --> 00:32:03,551
ABSOLUTELY.

663
00:32:03,586 --> 00:32:06,655
SO JAMAL, HOW
CONFIDENT ARE YOU THAT IF THE

664
00:32:06,689 --> 00:32:09,862
MERGE HAPPENED TOMORROW YOU HAVE
THE TEAM IN PLACE AND AFTER

665
00:32:09,896 --> 00:32:11,620
TONIGHT'S VOTE IT WILL EVEN BE
STRONGER?

666
00:32:11,655 --> 00:32:13,517
I'M NOT CONFIDENT I'LL BE
HERE TOMORROW.

667
00:32:13,551 --> 00:32:14,758
BASED ON WHAT?

668
00:32:14,793 --> 00:32:16,965
BASED ON WHAT NOURA SAID.

669
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,034
I'M VERY FEARFUL OF AN ALL-GIRLS
ALLIANCE RIGHT NOW.

670
00:32:20,068 --> 00:32:22,310
LOOK, JEFF, I WORK AT AN
ALL-GIRLS SCHOOL.

671
00:32:22,344 --> 00:32:26,931
I KNOW THE POWER OF WOMEN WHEN
THEY GET TOGETHER AND THEY

672
00:32:26,965 --> 00:32:32,896
UNDERSTAND THE COLLECTIVE POWER,
AND IN THIS TRIBE, 4-3, WE'RE

673
00:32:32,931 --> 00:32:34,172
OUTNUMBERED.

674
00:32:34,206 --> 00:32:36,482
SO I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S GOTTEN
INTO THESE GIRL'S HEADS THAT I'M

675
00:32:36,517 --> 00:32:39,206
THE ONE THAT NEEDS TO GO HOME
AND THEY'RE THE TEAM THEY WANT

676
00:32:39,241 --> 00:32:39,724
TO TAKE.

677
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:40,965
SO I HAVE NO IDEA.

678
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,758
I FIND THIS IDEA OF A WOMAN'S
ALLIANCE SO SEXIEST, SORRY.

679
00:32:44,793 --> 00:32:46,724
I KNOW THAT YOU DIDN'T MEAN IT
THAT WAY.

680
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:50,448
BUT IT'S REALLY OFFENSIVE TO BE
LIKE, OH, THE WOMEN OUTNUMBER

681
00:32:50,482 --> 00:32:52,172
THE MEN, THEY CAN JUST TAKE
OVER.

682
00:32:52,206 --> 00:32:55,275
LIKE THE AMOUNT OF FEAR IN
"SURVIVOR" ABOUT A WOMEN'S

683
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:59,448
ALLIANCE OUTPACES THE NUMBER OF
TIMES THERE HAS ACTUALLY BEEN A

684
00:32:59,482 --> 00:33:02,689
WOMAN'S ALLIANCE, NOT TO MENTION
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT MEN'S

685
00:33:02,724 --> 00:33:05,896
ALLIANCE, WE DON'T FEAR MEN'S
ALLIANCE, AND YET THREE MEN HAVE

686
00:33:05,931 --> 00:33:07,275
BEEN SITTING AT THE VERY END.

687
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,724
THAT'S NOT A THING.

688
00:33:08,758 --> 00:33:11,689
FOR SOME REASON IT WOULD BE A
THING FOR THREE WOMEN TO SIT AT

689
00:33:11,724 --> 00:33:12,620
THE END.

690
00:33:12,655 --> 00:33:14,620
WE'RE SPLITTING THIS ARBITRARILY
BY GENDER.

691
00:33:14,655 --> 00:33:15,655
WHY IS THAT?

692
00:33:15,689 --> 00:33:17,448
SORRY, I FEEL REALLY STRONGLY
ABOUT THIS.

693
00:33:17,482 --> 00:33:19,758
LET IT OUT, KELLEE!

694
00:33:19,793 --> 00:33:23,793
THE KEY WORD IN KELLEE'S
BEAUTIFULLY WORDED SPEECH THAT I

695
00:33:23,827 --> 00:33:25,896
BACK 100% IS ARBITRARY.

696
00:33:25,931 --> 00:33:29,034
AN I DON'T THINK IT IS
ARBITRARY.

697
00:33:29,068 --> 00:33:33,793
I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO ASK NOURA IF
SHE HAS EVER CONSIDERED AN

698
00:33:33,827 --> 00:33:35,000
ALL-WOMEN'S ALLIANCE.

699
00:33:35,034 --> 00:33:37,068
I THINK YOU SHOULD THROW THAT
OUT AND SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED.

700
00:33:37,103 --> 00:33:40,172
HAVE YOU EVER
CONSIDERED AN ALL-WOMEN'S

701
00:33:40,206 --> 00:33:40,827
ALLIANCE?

702
00:33:40,862 --> 00:33:42,517
IT SOUNDS COOL, WHY NOT?

703
00:33:42,551 --> 00:33:43,448
YEAH, OF COURSE I HAVE.

704
00:33:43,482 --> 00:33:44,241
WOW.

705
00:33:44,275 --> 00:33:45,862
WE ALL THINK ABOUT MANY
THINGS.

706
00:33:45,896 --> 00:33:48,482
I WOULD BE A DUMB PLAYER IF I
DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT AT SOME

707
00:33:48,517 --> 00:33:49,172
POINT.

708
00:33:49,206 --> 00:33:50,551
I BELIEVE IN CONFIDENT WOMEN.

709
00:33:50,586 --> 00:33:53,275
I LIKE WOMEN THAT ARE MAKING
THINGS HAPPEN IN THE WORLD, AND

710
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,275
I RESPECT IT.

711
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:57,034
IF YOU'RE A WOMAN, YOU'D BAND
WITH US, TOO

712
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:58,931
AND I'M NOT, SO I'M AFRAID.

713
00:33:58,965 --> 00:34:02,896
AN YOU'RE ALLOWED TO BE.

714
00:34:02,931 --> 00:34:04,413
KARISHMA.

715
00:34:04,448 --> 00:34:08,034
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THERE'S SO
MUCH THOUGHT ABOUT A WOMAN'S

716
00:34:08,068 --> 00:34:10,862
ALLIANCE BECAUSE OF THE SEISMIC
CULTURAL SHIFT THAT'S HAPPENING

717
00:34:10,896 --> 00:34:12,862
IN THE WAY WE VIEW GENDER?

718
00:34:12,896 --> 00:34:16,172
"SURVIVOR" IS A MICROCOSM OF
AMERICA.

719
00:34:16,206 --> 00:34:19,241
IF WE LOOK AT WHAT'S BEEN GOING
ON IN AMERICA THIS PAST YEAR

720
00:34:19,275 --> 00:34:22,655
ESPECIALLY WITH THE ME TOO
MOVEMENT.

721
00:34:22,689 --> 00:34:25,620
, WITH WOMEN FEELING EMPOWERED
TO SPEAK UP FOR THEMSELVES AND

722
00:34:25,655 --> 00:34:30,862
TELL THE STORIES OF TIMES THAT
THEY HAVE FELT SHUT DOWN AND SO

723
00:34:30,896 --> 00:34:34,551
BACK HERE IN "SURVIVOR" WORLD,
IT'S GOING THE MY A PART IN HOW

724
00:34:34,586 --> 00:34:35,827
YOU PLAY "SURVIVOR."

725
00:34:35,862 --> 00:34:38,379
EXACTLY.

726
00:34:38,413 --> 00:34:42,000
I DON'T BLAME JAMAL FOR BEING
CONSIDERED THAT THIS IS A

727
00:34:42,034 --> 00:34:46,724
POSSIBILITY, BUT WITH WHAT
KELLEE SAID, IT IS ARBITRARY.

728
00:34:46,758 --> 00:34:49,758
JANET, THIS IS A
REALLY POWERFUL TOPIC,

729
00:34:49,793 --> 00:34:53,068
ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG WOMEN WHO
WATCH "SURVIVOR," THE EIGHT,

730
00:34:53,103 --> 00:34:54,448
NINE, TEN, 11 YEAR OLDS.

731
00:34:54,482 --> 00:34:56,034
THIS IS THE WORLD THEY KNOW NOW.

732
00:34:56,068 --> 00:34:58,931
HAVE A VOICE, STAND UP, BE WHO
YOU ARE.

733
00:34:58,965 --> 00:35:02,482
AS THE OLDEST WOMAN IN THIS
GROUP, YOU HAVE PERSPECTIVE HERE

734
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,793
THAT NO ONE ELSE DOES.

735
00:35:03,827 --> 00:35:05,034
RIGHT.

736
00:35:05,068 --> 00:35:09,551
TO ASSUME THAT WOMEN ARE
GOING TO BOND BASED ON GENDER IS

737
00:35:09,586 --> 00:35:10,310
VERY NEGATIVE.

738
00:35:10,344 --> 00:35:12,275
THAT'S PUTTING WOMEN DOWN.

739
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:16,310
THAT'S SAYING WOMEN DON'T HAVE A
BRAIN TO SAY, MAYBE JAMAL HAS

740
00:35:16,344 --> 00:35:19,517
SOMETHING TO OFFER ME AS A HUMAN
BEING.

741
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:20,793
YEAH.

742
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:24,034
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT BASED ON
THEIR SEX OR ON THEIR EDUCATION

743
00:35:24,068 --> 00:35:26,103
OR THEIR SOCIOECONOMIC
BACKGROUND.

744
00:35:26,137 --> 00:35:30,379
IT'S WHO THEY ARE, YOU NO, AND
TO THINK THERE ARE SOME

745
00:35:30,413 --> 00:35:33,103
WONDERFUL THINGS THAT HAVE
HAPPENED WITH WOMEN IN THE LAST

746
00:35:33,137 --> 00:35:37,137
YEAR, AND TRUST ME, THAT
REFLECTS ON THE MEN THAT ARE

747
00:35:37,172 --> 00:35:43,275
SUPPORTIVE OF WOMEN, BECAUSE IN
MY EXPERIENCE, YOU CAN'T BE A

748
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:48,517
POWERFUL WOMAN WITHOUT MEN AND
WOMEN BACKING YOU.

749
00:35:48,551 --> 00:35:54,827
YOU NEED TO EARN YOUR RESPECT,
YOUR DIGNITY, YOUR POSITION, WHO

750
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:56,931
YOU ARE AS HUMAN BEINGS TO EACH
OTHER.

751
00:35:56,965 --> 00:36:01,206
I MEAN, I HAVE LIVED IT.

752
00:36:01,241 --> 00:36:02,931
SORRY.

753
00:36:02,965 --> 00:36:04,620
THAT'S WELL SAID.

754
00:36:04,655 --> 00:36:07,827
JANET, I THINK THAT WAS A
REALLY BEAUTIFUL WAY OF PUTTING

755
00:36:07,862 --> 00:36:10,034
IT, REALLY TRYING THE TAKE THE
INDIVIDUAL AND HUMANIZE EACH

756
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:10,896
PERSON.

757
00:36:10,931 --> 00:36:11,931
THAT'S WHAT THE THEME SHOULD BE
ABOUT.

758
00:36:11,965 --> 00:36:16,103
I THINK THAT'S HOW GAME WINNERS
GET TO THE END.

759
00:36:16,137 --> 00:36:18,896
THAT'S ANOTHER LESSON TO TAKE
AWAY FROM THIS GAME.

760
00:36:18,931 --> 00:36:20,551
LOVE YOU.

761
00:36:20,586 --> 00:36:23,137
JAMAL, NEVER HAD A
TRIBAL LIKE THIS EVER.

762
00:36:23,172 --> 00:36:27,310
IT'S TALKING ABOUT THINGS
THAT I'M IS PASSIONATE ABOUT AND

763
00:36:27,344 --> 00:36:30,241
I AM JUST BEAMING WITH PRIDE FOR
THE WOMEN IN FRONT OF ME TO

764
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:33,586
SPEAK ABOUT THEIR PERSPECTIVES
AND EXPERIENCES AND I'M GETTING

765
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,379
PERSPECTIVES ABOUT MYSELF FROM
DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND LEARNING

766
00:36:36,413 --> 00:36:38,896
ABOUT DIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE,
SO IT'S REAL.

767
00:36:38,931 --> 00:36:43,241
IT'S WHAT WE HAVE JUST BEEN
LIVING FOR 19 DAYS.

768
00:36:43,275 --> 00:36:46,793
JACK, ON ONE HAND,
BEAUTIFUL BONDING, POWERFUL

769
00:36:46,827 --> 00:36:49,413
CONVERSATION, AND ON THE OTHER
HAND, SOMEBODY IS GOING TO BE

770
00:36:49,448 --> 00:36:51,068
VOTED OUT.

771
00:36:51,103 --> 00:36:53,758
HOW DO YOU POSSIBLY BALANCING
THAT ON A NIGHT LIKE TONIGHT?

772
00:36:53,793 --> 00:36:55,931
WE ARE PLAYING A GAME.

773
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:58,655
THESE RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE'RE
BUILDING ARE VERY TRUE.

774
00:36:58,689 --> 00:37:02,034
JUST BECAUSE I'M GOING TO WRITE
YOUR NAME DOWN DOES NOT MEAN I

775
00:37:02,068 --> 00:37:04,689
DON'T CENTRAL YOU THAT
RELATIONSHIP THAT I MADE.

776
00:37:04,724 --> 00:37:07,793
I EXPECT EVERYONE AND I HOPE
EVERYONE TO HAVE THE SAME

777
00:37:07,827 --> 00:37:09,275
PERSPECTIVE AT THE END OF THE
GAME.

778
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,103
KELLEE, IS THAT
POSSIBLE, THAT YOU CAN HAVE A

779
00:37:12,137 --> 00:37:15,206
BOND THAT'S REAL AND STILL
BETRAY EACH OTHER?

780
00:37:15,241 --> 00:37:17,413
I MEAN, I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.

781
00:37:17,448 --> 00:37:21,000
AS WE GO INTO THE MASTERING, I
THINK THAT WILL LIKELY HAPPEN

782
00:37:21,034 --> 00:37:24,103
MORE AND MORE, AND YET IT IS AN
EMOTIONAL ROLLINGER COASTER TO

783
00:37:24,137 --> 00:37:26,344
GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE
TWO.

784
00:37:26,379 --> 00:37:28,551
I CAN IN THE BELIEVE
AFTER THIS TRIBAL THAT WE'RE

785
00:37:28,586 --> 00:37:30,172
GOING TO VOTE SOMEBODY OUT, BUT
WE ARE.

786
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,793
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

787
00:37:31,827 --> 00:37:37,551
JANET, YOU'RE UP.

788
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,034
YOU TOOK THREE SHOTS AT ME
AND YOU MISSED AND I'M NAILING

789
00:37:48,068 --> 00:37:49,586
YOU ON MY FIRST TRY.

790
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:52,655
STAY DRY, SWEETHEART.

791
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:33,689
I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

792
00:38:33,724 --> 00:38:35,310
THE ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT THE

793
00:38:35,344 --> 00:38:42,551
PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME
TO DO SO.

794
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:45,689
JEFF, I THINK I GOT A LITTLE
SOMETHING.

795
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:52,034
GIVE ME A SECOND TO FISH IT OUT.

796
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:55,034
JUST TRYING TO MAKED TO THE
MASTERING.

797
00:38:55,068 --> 00:38:57,034
I'M PLAYING IT FOR MYSELF.

798
00:38:57,068 --> 00:39:05,000
WHY WOULDN'T HE HAVE PLAYED
IT LAST TIME?

799
00:39:05,034 --> 00:39:09,172
THIS IS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

800
00:39:09,206 --> 00:39:14,137
ANY VOTES CAST FOR DEAN WILL NOT
COUNT.

801
00:39:14,172 --> 00:39:15,379
ALL RIGHT.

802
00:39:15,413 --> 00:39:21,862
JEFF, HOLD ON.

803
00:39:21,896 --> 00:39:28,931
THEY GOT ALL KINDS OF IDOLS.

804
00:39:28,965 --> 00:39:33,034
OH, MY GOD.

805
00:39:33,068 --> 00:39:35,034
I'M LAYING THIS FOR NOURA.

806
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:38,103
YOU ARE?

807
00:39:38,137 --> 00:39:44,689
OH, MY GOD.

808
00:39:44,724 --> 00:39:46,034
THIS IS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

809
00:39:46,068 --> 00:39:50,034
ANY VOTES CAST FOR NOURA WILL
NOT COUNT.

810
00:39:52,137 --> 00:39:52,793
OKAY.

811
00:39:52,827 --> 00:39:56,034
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

812
00:39:56,068 --> 00:39:59,137
OH, MY GOD.

813
00:39:59,172 --> 00:40:02,000
FIRST VOTE DEAN.

814
00:40:02,034 --> 00:40:05,758
DOES NOT COUNT.

815
00:40:05,793 --> 00:40:06,241
DEAN.

816
00:40:06,275 --> 00:40:10,137
WILL NOT COUNT.

817
00:40:10,172 --> 00:40:10,620
DEAN.

818
00:40:10,655 --> 00:40:16,827
DOES NOT COUNT.

819
00:40:16,862 --> 00:40:17,275
DEAN.

820
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:23,655
DOES NOT COUNT.

821
00:40:23,689 --> 00:40:24,137
DEAN.

822
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:32,896
DOES NOT COUNT.

823
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:33,344
JACK.

824
00:40:33,379 --> 00:40:46,068
ONE VOTE JACK.

825
00:40:46,103 --> 00:40:50,068
SEVENTH PERSON VOTED OUT AND
FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY, JACK.

826
00:40:50,103 --> 00:41:00,068
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

827
00:41:00,103 --> 00:41:01,172
DANG.

828
00:41:01,206 --> 00:41:10,586
THEY GOT HIS ASS.

829
00:41:14,206 --> 00:41:19,379
JACK, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

830
00:41:19,413 --> 00:41:20,379
BYE, JACK.

831
00:41:20,413 --> 00:41:28,068
LOVE YOU.

832
00:41:28,103 --> 00:41:31,103
SEE YAW ALL.

833
00:41:33,517 --> 00:41:36,344
WELL, IT'S NIGHTS
LIKE TONIGHT THAT HAVE KEPT

834
00:41:36,379 --> 00:41:40,413
"SURVIVOR" RELEVANT FROM GOING
ON 20 YEARS.

835
00:41:40,448 --> 00:41:43,034
BECAUSE YOU TICK A GROUP OF
PEOPLE AND YOU FORCE THEM TO

836
00:41:43,068 --> 00:41:47,034
MAKE THEIR OWN SOCIETY AND QUITE
OFTEN THAT SOCIETY THAT YOU FORM

837
00:41:47,068 --> 00:41:51,793
IS A REFLECTION OF THE GREATER
SOCIETY, AND THEN THE TWISTS,

838
00:41:51,827 --> 00:41:53,275
YOU GOT TO VOTE 'EM OUT.

839
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,275
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

840
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,379
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

841
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:58,137
GOOD NIGHT.

STAY TUNED FOR SCENES

844
00:42:13,379 --> 00:42:14,379
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

845
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:22,517
NEXT TIME ON "SURVIVOR," A
MILESTONE IS HIT.

846
00:42:22,551 --> 00:42:23,724
WHAT, WHAT?

847
00:42:23,758 --> 00:42:25,413
WE'RE ALL REALLY EXCITED TO
BE HERE AT THE MERGE.

848
00:42:25,448 --> 00:42:26,724
NOW IT'S GAME ON.

849
00:42:26,758 --> 00:42:28,551
AND ALL HELL BREAKS
LOOSE.

850
00:42:28,586 --> 00:42:30,551
ALL OF THOSE OLD LAIRO HAVE
TO GO.

851
00:42:30,586 --> 00:42:33,551
WE SPLIT YOU AND KELLEE UP.

852
00:42:33,586 --> 00:42:35,931
SHE TOLD US TO VOTE YOU.

853
00:42:35,965 --> 00:42:37,413
THE PLAN IS TO VOTE YOU.

854
00:42:37,448 --> 00:42:39,034
I CAN'T GO OUT LIKE A PUNK.

855
00:42:39,068 --> 00:42:40,724
I'M REALLY SAD I'M OUT OF THE
GAME.

856
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:42,758
MAYBE DNCS ME AS A THREAT, WHICH
IS COOL.

857
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:46,137
BUT EVERYONE THAT WAS THERE
WANTED ME TO BE THERE EXCEPT FOR

858
00:42:46,172 --> 00:42:47,448
ONE OR TWO PEOPLE.

859
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:51,551
OVERALL THIS WAS WAY FREAKIN'
HARDER THAN I THAWING IT WAS

860
00:42:51,586 --> 00:42:54,000
GOING TO BE, BUT I'M HAPPY WITH
HOW I DID.

861
00:42:54,034 --> 00:42:57,103
I THINK I WAS ABLE TO SHOW MY
TRUE COLORS, AND I'M FREAKIN'

862
00:42:57,137 --> 00:42:59,482
PUMPED TO BE ON THE JURY.
