1
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:06,256
>> YOU LOOKING AT SOMETHING?

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:08,758
>> WHO THINKS OF THAT?

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,844
>> YOU'RE LIKE A JEALOUS
GIRLFRIEND RIGHT NOW.

4
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:29,487
>> TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS CRAZY,
BECAUSE NO ONE TOLD ME UNTIL

5
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:30,405
TRIBAL MY NAME WAS GETTING
WRITTEN DOWN, BUT THEN DEAN

6
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:33,700
GOES, OH, NO, TOMMY, YOU'RE
GETTING VOTES.

7
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,161
THAT MOMENT SAVED MY NAME
BECAUSE KARISHMA WAS GOING TO

8
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,288
PUT MY NAME DOWN, NOURA, AND
ELAINE.

9
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:42,667
IF DEAN DIDN'T SAY, HEY, WHERE
ARE YOUR VOTES GOING, WE WOULD

10
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,295
HAVE VOTED THE SAME WAY, I WOULD
HAVE WENT HOME BECAUSE THE

11
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:49,299
PERSON THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO
TRUST LIED TO US ALL DAY LONG.

12
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:53,386
I'M SO MAD AT NOURA FOR NOT
TELLING ME UNTIL TRIBAL COUNCIL,

13
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,306
BECAUSE AS AN ALLIANCE MEMBER,
IT'S NOT THAT YOU JUST VOTE WITH

14
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,809
THE PERSON, BUT YOU PROTECT THAT
PERSON.

15
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,521
>> I WANT TO SAY ONE THING,
FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU ALL FOR

16
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:03,813
KEEPING ME HERE.

17
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,064
>> YEAH.

18
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:08,443
>> SECONDLY, TOMMY, I'M TELLING
YOU, I WAS NEVER GOING TO PUT

19
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:12,322
YOU DOWN TONIGHT, AN I'M SORRY I
LET THIS ALL GET THE BEST OF ME.

20
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:16,284
I SHOULDN'T HAVE, BUT I WAS
GOING THE TELL YOU IN TRIAL.

21
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:19,078
DEAN IS THICK IN THE HEAD
BECAUSE HE PROPOSED THIS.

22
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,163
THERE'S NO WAY I WAS GOING WITH
IT.

23
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,665
AS SOON AS THAT HAPPENED, HE'S
IN YOUR EAR, WHATEVER.

24
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:28,004
>> NOW I HAVE NOURA PLEADING FOR
MY FORGIVENESS, BUT I WAS SO

25
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:30,173
AGITATED, AT THAT POINT I DIDN'T
WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH HER.

26
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,343
>> NOURA...

27
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,346
>> DAN, DEAN PISSED ME OFF SO
MUCH.

28
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,224
DEAN MESSED UP THE WHOLE PLAN.

29
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,391
AND SO EVERYONE THINKS IT'S MY
FAULT.

30
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:44,354
I CAN'T BELIEVE I CONSIDERED
WORKING WITH THIS I GO THAT I

31
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:53,071
HAVE SAID FROM DAY ONE CANNOT BE
TRUSTED.

32
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,782
SO DEAN HAS THIS PRIZE PAIR OF
SHOES.

33
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,368
IT'S LIKE THE CLEANEST,
NICEST-LOOKING ARTICLE OF

34
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:01,162
CLOTHING ON ANYONE IN THE GAME
OR IN LIFE.

35
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,248
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M GOING TO GIVE
HIM SOMETHING ANNOYING TO END

36
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:06,084
HIS DAY ON A HIGH NOTE FOR
MYSELF.

37
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:11,172
SO I LITERALLY PUT THEM AT THE
TOP OF THE FLAG IN A PLACE WHERE

38
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:16,719
HE CAN'T REACH, BECAUSE I'M
TALLER THAN HIM.

39
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,722
SO I PUT THEM THERE, BECAUSE
THERE'S A BUNCH OF ARTICLES OF

40
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,560
CLOTHING OF ALL THE LOST SOULS
FROM THE GAME.

41
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,436
PUN INDIDDED.

42
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,400
AND HIS SOLES ARE SITTING RIGHT
UP TOP, NEXT TO GO.

43
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:45,957
YOU'RE ON THE WAY OUT, WHETHER
YOU KNOW IT OR NOT.

44
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,624
Captioning funded by CBS
and FORD.

45
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,586
We go further, so you can.

46
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:55,884
WHEN I SHOULD HAVE KEPT IT IN MY
POCKET, BUT, HELL, I KNOW I'M IN

47
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,093
TROUBLE.

48
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,721
I WAS MAKING SURE I WAS GOING TO
BE HIRE THE FIGHT ANOTHER DAY,

49
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:00,763
THAT'S THE WHOLE THING.

50
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,433
YOU GOT TO BE HERE TO FIGHT
ANOTHER DAY.

51
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:07,103
THAT MEANS THE IMMUNITY IDOL IS
BACK OUT HERE.

52
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,439
NOW I GOT TO DO IS FIND A NEED
UNTIL A HAYSTACK WITHIN 24 HOURS

53
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:21,451
OR I GO HOME.

54
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,412
>> AN IDOL CAN SHAKE EVERYTHING
UP.

55
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:27,415
SO RIGHT AWAY IN THE MORNING, MY
GIRL JANET AND I, TOMMY AND HIS

56
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:35,924
MOMMY WENT ON AN IDOL HUNT.

57
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,635
>> IT'S GOT TO BE AROUND HERE.

58
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:43,097
>> EVERYBODY'S IDOL SEARCHING,
BUT I WANT TO GET IT BEFORE

59
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:46,476
ELAINE OR DEAN AND EVEN TOMMY,
TO BE HONEST.

60
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,518
THIS IS ALL ABOUT ME.

61
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,437
AND I FOUND AN IDOL BEFORE.

62
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,647
I KNOW WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR.

63
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,526
SO I'M LOOKING IN ALL THE AREAS
THAT I THINK AN IDOL SCREAMS,

64
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:07,997
THIS IS WHERE I'M HIDING.

65
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:13,836
AN I GO TO ONE OF THE TREE
STUMP, AND THEN I SEE THIS BLUE

66
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,004
LITTLE CORNER.

67
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:21,469
AND I PULL IT OUT, AND I'M LIKE
... IT WAS LIKE CHRISTMAS

68
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,845
MORNING AS A NINE-YEAR-OLD.

69
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,223
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

70
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,975
YOU HAVE FOUND THE IMMUNITY
IDOL.

71
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:30,812
THE LAST TIME YOU CAN USE THIS
IDOL IS WHEN THERE ARE FIVE

72
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,356
PLAYERS REMAINING IN THE GAME.

73
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,026
I'M SO GRATEFUL AND THANKFUL TO
HAVE AN IDOL THAT COULD POSSIBLY

74
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,570
GET ME TO THE FINAL FOUR.

75
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,906
IT'S JUST BLOWING MY DOORS OFF.

76
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:48,579
COULD YOU IMAGINE ME WINNING?

77
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,581
IT'S LIKE IT COULD HAPPEN.

78
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:56,337
>> TOMMY.

79
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,549
>> WE COULD BE OUT HERE FOR
HOURS, YOU KNOW.

80
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:06,097
>> I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND IT.

81
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,473
>> WHY ARE THEY STOPPING AND
CHITCHATTING.

82
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,058
>> TALKING ABOUT WHAT?

83
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,060
>> LOOK AT THEM, LOOK AT THEM.

84
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,186
>> WOW.

85
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:17,734
>> IT LOOKS LIKE JANET IS
SHOWING HIM SOMETHING.

86
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,570
YEAH, HE'S DEFINITELY -- YOU SEE
THEM LOOKING DOWN AT SOMETHING,

87
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,195
RIGHT?

88
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,405
THEY'RE READING SOMETHING.

89
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,616
I REALLY WANT TO FIND THE IDOL
JUST TO STIR THINGS UP, BUT WE

90
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,079
FOUND JANET AND TOMMY, AND
THEY'RE STOPPED DEAD IN THEIR

91
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,789
TRACKS, AND THEY'RE LOOKING DOWN
AT SOMETHING.

92
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,916
I THINK THEY FOUND IT.

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,420
IT SUCKS, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,
KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION IS

94
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,588
POWER IN THIS GAME.

95
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,466
SO KNOWING THAT PUTS ME IN A
GOOD SPOT.

96
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,782
TO ME I LOVE IT.

97
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,493
LIKE WHO DOESN'T LOVE A CRAZY
WOMAN, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

98
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,661
>> I THINK WE CAN EAT COLD RICE.

99
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,455
>> WHAT?

100
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,624
>> NOURA DID IT.

101
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,585
>> HOW DID SHE PROPORTION IT IN.

102
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:18,127
>> SHE'S CRAZY.

103
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,378
>> THAT'S REALLY WEIRD.

104
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:24,092
>> BECAUSE NOURA IS SO CRAZY, IT
WOULD MAKE SENSE TO GET RID OF

105
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,136
HER FOR PEACE OF MIND, BUT I
KNOW WHO PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE

106
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:27,470
IS NOW.

107
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,721
IT'S ME.

108
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,641
I'M GOING TO WIN THIS GAME IF
THEY LET ME GET TO THE END, BUT

109
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,602
THESE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO SIT
NEXT TO ME.

110
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:35,019
THEY'RE COMING AFTER ME.

111
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:35,978
I ALREADY KNOW.

112
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:40,650
SO I HAVE TO MAKE MOVES TO GET
THERE MYSELF.

113
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,986
I THINK TOMMY IS GOING TO GO ON
A RUN AND WIN NEXT FEW.

114
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,488
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN IN.

115
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,615
>> STRAIGHT-UP PHYSICAL STUFF,
HE'LL BE TO THE END.

116
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,201
SO AS LONG AS YOU HAVE TOMMY,
YOU'RE GOOD.

117
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:53,663
YOU WON'T HAVE IMMUNITY AROUND
YOUR NECK, BUT IF TOMMY WANTS

118
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,540
YOU TO STAY, YOU WOULD.

119
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:59,627
>> THE PROBLEM IS NOBODY WANTS
TO SIT NEXT TO ME.

120
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:06,008
>> WELL, DEAN AND I DON'T THINK
DAN DOES.

121
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,345
MY PERSONAL OPINION IS WHEN THEY
GET DOWN TO FOUR, LIKE THEY'RE

122
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:10,012
GOING TO MAKE YOU MAKE FIRE.

123
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,223
>> OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE SO RIGHT.

124
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,977
>> BECAUSE IF YOU THINK THEY'RE
GOING TO LET TOMMY DRAG HIS

125
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,186
LITTLE FRIEND ALONG, YOU'RE
MISTAKEN.

126
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,523
>> I TRUST TOMMY AND DAN, BUT
ELAINE IS MAKING ME THINK THERE

127
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:25,153
IS AN ALL-BOYS ALLIANCE.

128
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:28,030
I'M WORRIED ABOUT DEAN BECAUSE
HE WANTS MY SPOT.

129
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:32,535
DEAN WANTS TO BE CLOSE TO DAN
AND TOMMY.

130
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:37,206
SO ELAINE'S ADVICE PROMPTS ME TO
ASK MORE QUESTIONS.

131
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,042
ELAINE WAS SAYING LIKE DEAN
WANTS ME OUT BECAUSE HE WANTS TO

132
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:44,005
GO TO THE FINALE WITH YOU AND
THAT YOU BOYS ARE GOING TO DO A

133
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,674
TOP THREE WITHOUT ME AND THAT
FOR ME TO SIT HERE AND THINK

134
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:51,012
THAT YOU WOULD ACTUALLY TAKE ME
IS STUPID.

135
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:54,682
>> STOP RIGHT HERE.

136
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:58,728
I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE A JEALOUS
GIRLFRIEND RIGHT NOW.

137
00:07:58,811 --> 00:07:59,729
>> YEAH.

138
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,689
>> I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE JANET,
ME, YOU, AND DAN.

139
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,774
WE CAN'T HAVE JANET THERE.

140
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:04,901
>> I'M SCARED.

141
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,738
>> AFTER THE LAST TRIBAL
COUNCIL, COY HAVE A BOND WITH

142
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,949
DEAN, SO I TOLD LAUREN I'M GOING
TO TAKE HER TO THE FINAL THREE,

143
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,326
BUT I'M RALLY NOT.

144
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,578
SHE'S AN AMAZING PERSON, BUT
THAT'S THE REASON I NEED HER OUT

145
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,246
OF THIS GAME, BECAUSE SHE'S
GOING TO WIN.

146
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,916
>> NO ONE IS COMING FOR YOU AND
THEY CAN'T.

147
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,334
THAT'S WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THIS.

148
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,378
AS A TEACHER, I DON'T GET TO
LIE, BUT HERE WHERE YOU'RE

149
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,464
ALLOWED TO LIE, I GUESS I'M GOOD
AT IT.

150
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:29,300
IT'S FUN FOR ME.

151
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,761
HERE'S THE DEAL, LAUREN THINKS
WE'RE GOING WITH HER.

152
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,765
BUT WE CAN'T HAVE LAUREN.

153
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:36,599
SHE WINS IT.

154
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:37,683
>> LAUREN GOES HOME.

155
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,770
THE THREE GUYS.

156
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:41,062
>> GOOD.

157
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,271
GOOD.

158
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,900
>> UNBEKNOWNST TO OTHER PEOPLE,
DEAN IS PART OF A FINAL THREE

159
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,109
WITH ME AND TOMMY.

160
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,780
AND IF DEAN STICKS WITH THE
PLAN, THAT FINAL THREE MAKES THE

161
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:51,906
MOST SENSE TO ME.

162
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:55,117
BUT I'M NOT SURE DEAN IS
SOMEBODY WHO STICKS WITH PLAN.

163
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,995
>> NO, NO!

164
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,456
OH, MY GOD.

165
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:09,423
COME ON OVER, GUYS.

166
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,968
>> SOMETIMES IT COMES DOWN TO
CHANCE.

167
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,304
CRAW -- DRAWN ONE NAME THAT.

168
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,473
PERSON WILL COME TO THE ISLAND
OF IDOLS IMMEDIATELY.

169
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,267
>> DO IT, JANET.

170
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,642
DRAW IT.

171
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,269
I OLD HOLE IT.

172
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:29,193
>> READY?

173
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:29,694
>> DEAN.

174
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,279
>> DAMN, I KNEW IT.

175
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,196
>> DO IT.

176
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,656
>> SOMETIMES THIS GAME IS LEFT
UP TO CHANCE.

177
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,993
ONE OUT OF SEVEN SHOT, AND IT'S
ME.

178
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,035
>> SEE YA, MAN.

179
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,997
>> THAT'S CRAZY, ESPECIALLY THIS
LATE IN THE GAME.

180
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,166
I WOULD IMAGINE IT'S THE LAST
TRIP TO THE ISLAND OF THE IDOLS.

181
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,169
THIS COULD CHANGE THE WHOLE
COURSE OF MY GAME.

182
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,298
SOMETHING IS FINALLY COMING MY
WAY AND IT FEELS REALLY, REALLY

183
00:09:50,381 --> 00:10:00,850
GOOD.

184
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,521
>> I LOVE "SURVIVOR."

185
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:06,856
I LOVE BEING OUT HERE.

186
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:12,028
IT FEELS LYING HOME TO ME.

187
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:16,365
I'VE BEEN HERE SO MANY TIMES
OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES.

188
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,868
THIS IS SO GOOD.

189
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,369
SANDRA, THIS IS ALMOST DONE.

190
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,913
IT'S LIKE RIDING A BIKE.

191
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,415
HOW IS IT?

192
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,082
>> DELICIOUS.

193
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:30,880
>> AND I'M BACK ON.

194
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:34,383
>> I'M SO EXCITED TO GO TO THE
ISLAND OF THE IDOLS.

195
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:40,556
I MEAN, I ALREADY GOT THE LEGACY
ADVANTAGE THAT JAMAL GAVE ME.

196
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,059
SO IMAGINE IF I CAN GET AN
ADVANTAGE THAT WILL DRIVE ME

197
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,395
THROUGH TO THE END TO THE FINAL
THREE?

198
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,646
PSYCHED, MAN.

199
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,857
THE CAPTAIN OF THE BOAT DROPS ME
OFF AND YOU START TO SEE THESE

200
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,779
BIG OLD FIGUREHEADS, AND THERE
ARE T TWO OF THEM ARE RIGHT

201
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:55,946
THERE TO GREET ME.

202
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,824
ROB AND SANDRA.

203
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,078
>> WHAT'S UP,
Y'ALL?

204
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,246
IT REALLY FELT LIKE YOUR
CHILDHOOD IDOLS.

205
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,416
ALL YOU WANT DO IS ASK FOR AN
AUTOGRAPH SO YOU CAN BRING IT

206
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,210
BACK AND HANG IT ON YOUR WALL.

207
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,463
THIS IS LIKE SEEING MICHAEL
JORDAN AND SERENA WILLIAMS.

208
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,299
>> WE MADE SOME FISH EARLIER,
YOU HUNGRY?

209
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,927
>> I HAVEN'T EATEN ANYTHING ALL
DAY.

210
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:18,928
THANKS, GOD.

211
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:19,762
THIS IS AMAZING.

212
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,138
>> GOOD, RIGHT?

213
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,432
>> SO HOW HAS THE GAME BEEN FOR
YOU?

214
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,768
>> I FEEL REALLY GOOD.

215
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,104
LIKE WE'RE ABOUT TO PULL
SOMETHING, BUT I BACKED OUT OF

216
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,355
THE BLINDSIDE.

217
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,817
THE GOAL BEING LEAVE THE OTHER
TWO, WHO WANTED TO DO THE BLIND

218
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:39,407
SIDE ON THE OUTS SO THAT WOULD
BE DONE AT SEVEN AND SIX.

219
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:44,995
THE REASON I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT
IS BECAUSE I GOT SOMETHING FOR

220
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:45,955
SIX.

221
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,125
I THINK YOU GUYS HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

222
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,836
>> ROB AND I HAD TO KEEP A
STRAIGHT FACER BECAUSE DEAN PUS

223
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,839
OUT A LEGACY ADVANTAGE, AND I
KNOW FOR FACT THAT IT'S FAKE.

224
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,966
>> CAN YOU GUYS CONFIRM THAT
THIS IS REAL OR NOT?

225
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,968
ONLY JEFF.

226
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:03,139
>> I DO THINK IT'S REAL, BUT I
PLAYED IT UP LIKE IT WAS FAKE,

227
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,266
AND I PAINTED ONE WITH PAINT, A
FAKE ONE.

228
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,184
AN I PLAYED THE FAKE ONE AT
NINE.

229
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:11,021
>> DEAN MADE A FAKE OF THE FAKE
LEGACY ADVANTAGE, AN WE'RE LIKE,

230
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:14,150
THIS DUDE IS BRILLIANT.

231
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,860
LIKE WHO THINKS OF THAT?

232
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:19,864
>> NOW, THIS IS WHAT ELSE I'M
THINKING?

233
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,992
IT'S A WASTE, AND YOU KNOW WHAT,
JUST TO BE SAFE, I MAY PLAY IT

234
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:29,290
UP TO BE LIKE, EVERYONE VOTE ME,
AND THEN I PLAY THIS, THEN HAVE

235
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,959
ALL THE JURY THINK THAT I WAS
CRAFTY ENOUGH AND LIKE SAVED MY

236
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,210
ASS AT SIX.

237
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:40,342
>> DEAN, IT'S NEVER A GOOD IDEA
TO TRY TO PUT VOTES ON YOURSELF.

238
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:44,180
EVEN IF YOU HAD A REAL LEGACY
ADVANTAGE, WHICH YOU DON'T,

239
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:48,184
BROTHER.

240
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,896
IT'S WITHIN THING TO GET TO THE
END OF "SURVIVOR" 39 DAYS.

241
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,315
IT'S ANOTHER THING TO GET TO THE
END AND WIN.

242
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,025
>> UH-HUH.

243
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,986
>> EVERYBODY THAT COMES TO THE
ISLAND OF THE IDOLS GETS A

244
00:12:59,069 --> 00:12:59,904
LESSON.

245
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:05,159
TODAY YOUR LESSON IS ABOUT JURY
MANAGEMENT.

246
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:09,163
THIS FAR INTO THE GAME, YOU HAVE
TO BE THINKING ABOUT IT.

247
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:13,167
IF YOU ARE ABLE IF MAKE IT TO
DAY 39, ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE

248
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,879
TO TELL A STORY TO THIS JURY
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BELIEVE

249
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,131
AND WANT TO GIVE YOU THE $1
MILLION CHECK.

250
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,885
IT WASN'T UNTIL I PLAYED A
REDEMPTION THEY WAS ABLE TO

251
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,931
FIGURE THAT OUT THAT IT'S NOT
ONLY GETTING TO THE END, BUT HOW

252
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:31,393
YOU GET THERE AND ONCE YOU GET
THERE, CAN YOU GET THE RESPECT

253
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,311
OF THE PEOPLE TO WRITE YOUR NAME
DOWN.

254
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:35,773
>> YOU DEFINITELY HAVE TO DO
STORYTELLING.

255
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,858
YOU HAVE TO PLAY UP ANY BRAVADO.

256
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,276
>> MAKE YOUR MOVES KNOWN.

257
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,406
YOU HAVE TO TELL THE STORY IN A
WAY THAT MAKES THEM FEEL LIKE

258
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,909
YOU PLAYED THE GAME THE BEST.

259
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:50,204
>> THEY WANT TO GIVE THE $1
MILLION TO THE BEST PLAYER SOME

260
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:53,082
IF ME, YOU AND ROB ARE ALL
MAKING THE SAME MOVES, YOU HAVE

261
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:57,920
TO GIVE REMEMBER ESTIMATE
YOURSELF FROM -- YOU HAVE TO

262
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,088
DIFFERENTIATE YOURSELF FROM
EVERYONE ELSE.

263
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,798
>> NOW IT'S TIME FOR TEST.

264
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:04,343
IF YOU'RE WILLING TO WAGER YOUR
VOTE AND YOU WIN, YOU HAVE A

265
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,262
CHOICE BETWEEN THREE ADVANTAGES.

266
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:11,976
AN EXTRA VOTE, AN IDOL
NULLIFIER, OR AN IMMUNITY IDOL

267
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:16,438
GOOD FOR THE NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL
THAT CANNOT BE PLAYED FOR

268
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,648
YOURSELF.

269
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:22,111
IF YOU LOSE, YOU LOSE YOUR VOTE
AT THE NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

270
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:26,156
THE TEST IS A SIMPLE GAME OF
CHANCE, A COIN FLIP.

271
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,118
>> DAMN.

272
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,160
A COIN FLIP?

273
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:30,786
DAMN.

274
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:32,288
>> IT'S A GAME OF CHANCE.

275
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,497
>> RIGHT.

276
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,959
THIS IS A SIMPLE GAME OF CHANCE,
A COIN FLIP THAT HE CAN USE TO

277
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,794
IMPRESS THE JURY.

278
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:44,300
IF DEAN WIN, HE CAN LET THEM
KNOW HE BASICALLY TOOK FATE INTO

279
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,303
HIS OWN HANDS AND RISKED IT ALL.

280
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,972
YOU KNOW, AT SOME POINT IN THIS
GAME, YOU HAVE TO TAKE A CHANCE.

281
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,182
>> YEAH.

282
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,225
RIGHT?

283
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,352
>> EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME IS
RISK VERSUS REWARD.

284
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,520
>> EXACTLY RIGHT.

285
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,982
>> SO I WANT, IF I CAN MAKE IT
TO THE FINAL THREE, TO SAY I

286
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:00,566
MADE SOME BIG MOVES.

287
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,651
THAT CAN BE A HUGE MOVE.

288
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,987
>> TELL THAT JURY THIS STORY
RIGHT HERE.

289
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,865
ROB AND SANDRA OFFERED ME A
CHANCE.

290
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,950
I HAD TO RISK MY VOTE ON A COIN
FLIP.

291
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:10,826
>> YEAH.

292
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:13,287
>> YOU GOT TO TAKE A CHANCE IN
THIS GAME.

293
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,164
I RISKED IT ALL ON A COIN FLIP.

294
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:15,664
>> IT COULD BE GOOD.

295
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,790
>> IT COULD BE GREAT.

296
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,169
>> HERE'S WHAT ELSE I'M
THINKING, JANET, WE THINK SHE

297
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:24,632
FOUND AN IDOL, SO I'M LEANING
TOWARD THE IDOL NULLIFYER.

298
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,718
I THINK THAT DOES SEEM LIKE A
BIG MOVE FOR ME ON THE JURY.

299
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,846
I THINK I HAVE PLAYED A SUBTLE
LOW-KEY GAME, WHICH I'VE BEEN

300
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:34,016
GOING FOR, BUT IN ORDER THE
HIGHLIGHT SOME RISKS I HAVE

301
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,851
TAKEN, SOME STRATEGY THAT I'VE
PLAYED.

302
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:39,021
I THINK IT'S ALMOST NECESSARY
THAT I TAKE THIS RISK, AS WELL.

303
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:39,480
I'M GOING TO DO IT.

304
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,023
I'M ON "SURVIVOR."

305
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:41,899
I'M GOING TO DO IT.

306
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,525
>> YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT?

307
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,235
>> HELL, YEAH.

308
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,153
YEAH.

309
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:49,156
>> SO YOU'RE RISK YOUR VOTE ON A
COIN FLIP.

310
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,033
IF YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU GET AN IDOL
NULLIFIER.

311
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:55,162
IF YOU'RE WRONG, YOU LOSE YOUR
VOTE.

312
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:55,579
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

313
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,205
>> LET'S DO IT.

314
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,748
>> ALL RIGHT.

315
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:58,374
DEAN.

316
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,919
>> COULD BE A $1 MILLION.

317
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,046
>> NO MEANS I DON'T GET IT.

318
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,172
>> YES MEANS YOU WIN.

319
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:05,923
OKAY?

320
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,175
>> DEAN, I HOPE YOU GET IT,
DEAN.

321
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:12,971
>> THANK YOU, SANDRA.

322
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,517
>> READY?

323
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:22,898
YOU NEED MOMENTS OF BRILLIANCE
TO WIN "SURVIVOR."

324
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:25,359
>> LET'S DO IT, MAN.

325
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,236
>> IT MIGHT COME EARLY, IT MIGHT
COME LATE, BUT AT SOME POINT IN

326
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:34,785
THIS GAME YOU HAVE TO TAKE A
CHANCE.

327
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,412
>> YEAH, BUDDY!

328
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,579
>> THAT'S AMAZING.

329
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,539
GIVE ME A HUG.

330
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,248
>> LET'S GO!

331
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,625
LET'S GO!

332
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,252
>> YOU GOT YOUR IDOL NULLIFIER.

333
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,129
>> YEAH, BUDDY.

334
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,338
THIS IS SOMETHING.

335
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,717
>> THE FACT THAT YOU TOOK THIS
CHANCE, IF IT PAYS OFF FOR YOU

336
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,386
AT THE END, IT COULD BE THE
DIFFERENCE IN PLAYING ONE OF

337
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:57,182
THOSE JURY VOTES AND PULLING $1
MILLION IN YOUR POCKET.

338
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,268
>> YES, SIR.

339
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,354
>> IT'S AWESOME TO HAVE THAT
LESSON IN JURY MANAGE.

340
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:06,316
IT'S OPENED MY EYES UP WAY MORE
TO, DAMN, THERE ARE SEVEN PEOPLE

341
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,278
LEFT AND YOU'RE THIS CLOSE TO
GETTING TO THE FINAL THREE WHERE

342
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:13,073
YOU'RE ACTUALLY MAY HAVE TO
MANAGE A JURY.

343
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,575
>> YOU'RE ALMOST THERE, YOU'RE
ALMOST THERE.

344
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,242
>> THANK YOU.

345
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,244
HAVE A GOOD ONE.

346
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,204
FIGURE OUT HOW YOU THINK EACH
ONE WILL REACT TO CERTAIN THINGS

347
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,414
THAT YOU'VE DONE.

348
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:25,127
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A CLEAR PLAN
TO WIN OVER THE JURY FOR $1

349
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,254
MILLION.

350
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,977
>> LET'S WAVE AT HIM SO HE FEELS
SPECIAL.

351
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,063
>> WHEN I'M ON THE BOAT
RETURNING FROM ISLAND OF THE

352
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,315
IDOL, DEFINITELY NERVOUS.

353
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:51,320
LIKE EVERYONE WHO HAS RETURNED
HAS TO GO UP AND STORY TIME FOR

354
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,280
EVERYONE AND SAY WHAT HAPPENED,
WHAT HAPPENED.

355
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,324
SO I NEED TO BE CRAFTY.

356
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,327
>> I WAS UPSET BECAUSE THERE
WERE NO SIGNPOSTS.

357
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,039
YOU COULD GIVE UP YOUR VOTE FOR
THE NEXT TRIBAL ONLY IF YOU WANT

358
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:06,668
TO PLAY, RISK IT, AND THERE IS A
GAME OF CHANCE, FLIP A COIN.

359
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,213
IF I WON I COULD CHOOSE BETWEEN
AN EXTRA VOTE THAT LAST ME

360
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:13,300
THROUGH SIX OR AN IDOL THAT
NEEDS TO BE PLAYED FOR SOMEONE

361
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,344
ELSE NEXT TRIBAL.

362
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,971
>> WHOA.

363
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:23,393
>> SO I CHOSE THE EXTRA VOTE
UNTIL SIX, AND I CHOSE TO PLAY,

364
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,061
FLIP, AND NOTHING.

365
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,688
>> YOU FLIP IT AND IT SAID NO.

366
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,483
>> I FLIPPED IT AND I SAID NO.

367
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:30,359
>> NEXT TRIBAL ONLY.

368
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,362
I TOLD THEM IT WAS ONLY A COIN
FLIP.

369
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,321
AND THEN I TOLD THEM I LOST.

370
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,365
SO A LITTLE FUDGE THERE.

371
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,034
BUT I THINK I WENT OVER PRETTY
WELL.

372
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:42,371
>> WAS THE EXTRA VOTE SOMETHING
YOU HAVE TO GO FIND SOMEWHERE.

373
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,998
>> THE EXTRA VOTE, I DON'T KNOW,
I DIDN'T WIN.

374
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,167
>> YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT
WAS.

375
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,379
>> MOVING FORWARD I WANT TO TELL
THE PEOPLE I'M WORKING WITH

376
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,799
ABOUT MY IDOL NULLIFIER, BECAUSE
I WANT TO COME CLOSER TO THEM,

377
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:58,595
SO IF I CAN HELP THEM OUT, THEY
CAN HELP ME OUT, LET'S "KUMBAYA"

378
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,847
UNTIL THE END OF THE GAME.

379
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:04,226
>> FLIP OF THE COIN, I WON AN
IDOL NULLIFIER, AND HOW IT WORKS

380
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:08,730
IS BEFORE THE VOTES ARE READ, I
PUT IT IN THE EARN, AN I NEED

381
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,231
THE WRITE DOWN WHO TO PLAY IT
ON.

382
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,357
>> DANG.

383
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,526
DEAN CAN PLAY MORE THAN I
THOUGHT.

384
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,444
TO BE HONEST, I THOUGHT DEAN WAS
JUST A GOAT.

385
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,281
I THOUGHT I COULD TAKE HIM TO
THE END AND HE WOULD MAKE NO

386
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,409
MOVES, BECAUSE DEAN DOESN'T
TALK.

387
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,577
HE SITS THERE, SMILES AND PUTS
HIS HANDS THROUGH HIS HAIR.

388
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,747
BUT AT THIS POINT HE HAS THE
LEGACY ADVANTAGE AND THE IDOL

389
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,415
NULLIFIER.

390
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,625
>> THE IDOL NULLIFIER IS CLUTCH.

391
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,253
>> SO WHAT ARE YOU THINKING IN.

392
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:35,424
>> WE STICK WITH WHOEVER YOU
WANT AT SIX, WHETHER IT BE NOURA

393
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,593
OR WHOEVER.

394
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,886
IT GIVES US GOOD OPTIONS.

395
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:42,097
>> SO IT MADE ME THINK THAT DEAN
IS ACTUALLY MUCH MORE OF A

396
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,265
PLAYER THAN I THINK.

397
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,601
I'M A LITTLE SCARED, BECAUSE I
WAS UNDERESTIMATING HIM AND

398
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:56,028
MAYBE HE'S GOT TO GO.

399
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:15,130
>> COME ON IN, GUYS.

400
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:17,090
>> OH, NO.

401
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:17,716
DANG IT.

402
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:22,304
>> Jeff: WELCOME TO DAY 35.

403
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,807
FIRST THINGS FIRST, LAUREN, GOT
TO TAKE BACK THE IMMUNITY

404
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,224
NECKLACE.

405
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,810
MARCH IT OVER.

406
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,812
>> I'LL GET IT BACK.

407
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:31,939
>> Jeff: LIKE THE CONFIDENCE.

408
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,442
THANK YOU.

409
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,778
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BECOME UP

YOU'LL THEN MAKE YOUR WAY ACROSS
A SERIES OF OBSTACLE, COLLECTING

413
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,786
ONE PUZZLE PIECE.

414
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:51,375
YOU WILL USE THAT PIECE TO SOLVE
A SURVIVOR WORD PUZZLE.

LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT.

418
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,511
DRAW FOR SPOTS, WE'LL GET IT TO.

419
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:16,066
HERE WE GO.

420
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:16,441
ALL RIGHT.

421
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,734
HERE WE GO.

422
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,360

423
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:18,694
>> NOW MY HEART IS RACING.

424
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,403
>> GO, BABY.

425
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,529
>> LET'S DO IT.

426
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:25,867
>> Jeff: GO!

427
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,370
TOMMY IS WHIPPING DOWN THIS
COURSE.

428
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,539
JANET TAKING HER TIME.

429
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,916
ELAINE MOVING QUICKLY.

430
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,379
YOU WANT TO GET THERE AS FAST AS
YOU CAN.

431
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,173
TOMMY IS GOOD.

432
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,049
ELAINE IS THERE.

433
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:45,512
YOU'RE GOOD.

434
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:45,887
ELAINE GOES DOWN.

435
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,473
DAN GOES DOWN.

436
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,100
>> OH, MY GOD.

437
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:54,521
>> Jeff: NOURA IS DOWN.

438
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,565
EVERYBODY STRUGGLING WITH BEING
DISIZDY, NOT ONLY IN THIS GAME

439
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,566
BUT RIGHT NOW.

440
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:01,737
IT IS TOMMY ON THE BALANCE BEAM.

441
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,196
HE HAS THE START AGAIN.

442
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,699
EVERYBODY NOW STARTING TO GET
UNDIZZY.

443
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:08,910
>> GO FOR IT.

444
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,537
JUST GO FOR IT.

445
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,206
>> Jeff: EVERYBODY TAKING A
MOMENT TO CENTER THEMSELVES.

446
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,542
YOU GOT TO GET ACROSS THAT BEAM.

447
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,419
TRYING TO KEEP IT TOGETHER.

448
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:21,089
IT IS VERY NARROW.

449
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,426
35 DAYS OF WEAR AND TEAR REALLY
SHOWING RIGHT NOW.

450
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,469
>> DAMN.

451
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:29,431
>> Jeff: DEAN STARTING TO WORK
ON HIS PUZZLE PIECE.

452
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,267
NOURA HAS HERS UNTIED.

453
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,393
>> LET'S GO.

454
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,771
>> NOURA CAN START WORKING ON
HER PUZZLEN DEAN CAN START

455
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,065
WORKING ON HIS PUZZLE.

456
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:41,610
STILL GOT FIVE PEOPLE TRYING TO
GET ACROSS THAT BEAM.

457
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,611
LAUREN IS GOOD.

458
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:42,944
THERE GOES DAN.

459
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,613
HE'S GOOD.

460
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,573
TOMMY IS GOOD.

461
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:47,491
ELAINE'S GOOD.

462
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,158
JANET'S GOOD.

463
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:53,622
EVERYBODY IS ON THEIR PUZZLE.

464
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,583
IT IS A SEVEN-WORD PHRASE.

465
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,961
YOU'RE GOING THE READ IT FROM
TOP TO BOTTOM.

466
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,130
>> I'M IN THE GOOD WITH WORDS.

467
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,423
>> Jeff: 35 DAYS.

468
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:06,468
YOU WANT THE MAKE IT TO DAY 36.

469
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,136
THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE.

470
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:16,103
WHAT ARE THE WORDS YOU NEED TO
SOLVE THIS PHRASE?

471
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:21,942
>> WHY CAN'T I SEE THIS?

472
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,653
>> Jeff: YOU'RE JUST LOOKING
FOR ANY WORD TO GET YOU STARTED.

473
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,530
SO EASY AT HOME.

474
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,990
CAN'T THEY SEE IT IN IT'S RIGHT
THERE.

475
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:32,577
MUCH TOUGHER WHEN IT'S YOU.

476
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:38,625
EVERYBODY DESPERATE, LOOKING FOR
SOME CLUE, SOME HINT.

477
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,336
EVERYBODY LOOKING OVER
EVERYBODY'S SHOULDER.

478
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,672
THIS IS NOT A PUZZLE THAT'S
GOING TO SLOWLY COME TOGETHER.

479
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:58,520
YOU'RE GOING TO FIGURE IT OUT,
AND IT'S GOING TO BE A RACE.

480
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,772
>> Jeff: ALL OF A SUDDEN DEAN
THINKS HE HAS SOMETHING.

481
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,357
DEAN WITH ANOTHER PIECE.

482
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,859
ELAINE WITH ANOTHER PIECE.

483
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,026
HE'S GOING TO SOLVE VERY FAST.

484
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:10,699
YOU CANNOT WASTE TIME.

485
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,201
JEFF, I'M DONE.

486
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,035
>> Jeff: SAY IT, DEAN.

487
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,705
>> THIS GAME WILL MESS WITH YOUR
MIND.

488
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,875
>> Jeff: DEAN HAS IT!

489
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,669
DEAN WINS IMMUNITY!

490
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:23,837
SAFE IN THE FINAL SIX.

491
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,296
CANNOT BE VOTED OUT.

492
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,881
>> GOOD JOB, DEAN.

493
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,008
>> DEAN, I HAD IT.

494
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,217
>> YOU HAD IT?

495
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,427
>> I HAD IT BEFORE YOU.

496
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:34,514
I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW THE
SWITCH THE TOM LETTERS AROUND.

497
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,724
SON OF A GUN.

498
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,185
I ALMOST WON.

499
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,227
I KNEW WHAT IT WAS.

500
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,687
I DIDN'T SOLVE IT FAST ENOUGH.

501
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,565
IT MAKES ME SO MAD, BECAUSE I
REALLY NEEDED TO WIN TODAY.

502
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,192
I'M PRETTY DESPERATE RIGHT NOW.

503
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:48,737
BUT NOURA IS SO OUT IN LEFT
FIELD, YOU CAN'T DEPEND ON HER

504
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,655
TO DO ANYTHING.

505
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:54,910
SO I'M VOTING FOR NOURA.

506
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:16,598
>> IT WILL MESS WITH YOUR MIND,
MAN.

507
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,767
>> I DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT THE
WORDS.

508
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:24,272
I JUST SAW THAT THE G OR
WHATEVER HAD A BANK ON THE BACK.

509
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:28,652
>> DEAN, MR. SCHISTY HIMSELF
ENDED UP WINNING BECAUSE THEY'RE

510
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:32,280
GOING TO VOTE ME OUT AS SOON AS
THEY COME I DON'T WANT TO GO

511
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:32,781
HOME.

512
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:33,573
IT'S DAY 35.

513
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,784
I GOT FOUR DAYS TO WIN $1
MILLION.

514
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:39,454
>> I'M GOING TO TRY TO PICK UP
SOME STICKS.

515
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:40,413
I'M NOT GOING TO QUIT.

516
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,623
ME AND LAUREN STILL GOT A TIGHT
RELATIONSHIP.

517
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:52,968
MAYBE I CAN GET HER TO MAKE A
MOVE AND USE ME.

518
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:56,429
>> SHE'S STILL GOING TO BE
LOOKING FOR AN IDOL.

519
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,305
UNLESS SHE ALREADY HAS ONE.

520
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,807
>> YOU CAN SEE IT IN HER FACE.

521
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,893
>> SHOULD WE PUT ALL OUR VOTES
ON HER.

522
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:02,811
>> I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD.

523
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,646
>> WHY NOT?

524
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,481
>> CAN WE DO THAT?

525
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:07,524
LET'S JUST THIS THAT?

526
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,483
>> OKAY.

527
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:10,318
>> HOW IS THE WATER, ELAINE?

528
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,113
>> NOURA THINKS WE'RE GOING
AFTER ELAINE BECAUSE SHE'S SUCH

529
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:16,658
A THREAT, BUT IN REALITY, PLAN
"A" IS TO GET ELAINE OUT, BUT

530
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:22,247
PLAN "B" IS TO PUT ENOUGH VOTES
ON NOURA SO IF ANY IDOL PLAYED

531
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,292
OR ANY ADVANTAGE IS PLAYED,
NOURA GOES HOME, TOO.

532
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,376
YOU NEVER KNOW IN THIS GAME.

533
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,919
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO HAVE THAT
PLAN "B" SET IN PLACE.

534
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:32,382
>> WE STILL WANT TO THROW ONE
VOTE ON NOURA IS MY QUESTION?

535
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,842
>> I THINK WE HAVE TO.

536
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:34,426
>> YEAH.

537
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,886
>> SO WE ALL VOTE ELAINE.

538
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,805
>> LET'S DO THAT.

539
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,308
JUST IN CASE SOMETHING CRAZY
HAPPENS.

540
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,518
>> EVERYONE WILL VOTE ELAINE
BESIDES DAN.

541
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:45,478
DAN WILL PUT ONE VOTE ON NOURA.

542
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:48,815
HOWEVER, I FEEL LIKE IN THE END
DAN AND TOMMY HIGH DECIDE THAT

543
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:53,361
I'M TOO MUCH OF A THREAT.

544
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:53,695
>> I SHOULD HAVE WON THAT.

545
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,405
I MESSED UP.

546
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:56,197
>> STOP.

547
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,159
>> WHAT?

548
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:02,203
I'LL DO WHATEVER TO STAY, YOU
KNOW THAT.

549
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,705
WHATEVER YOU FEEL LIKE DOING.

550
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:10,045
RIGHT NOW YOU COULD EITHER VOTE
OUT NOURA OR YOU CAN EVEN VOTE

551
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,212
OUT ME.

552
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:16,843
>> TONIGHT COULD BE ONE OF THE
LAST CHANCES FOR ME TO CONTROL

553
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:19,512
THE VOTE BECAUSE THE NUMBERS ARE
WHITTLING DOWN.

554
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:23,099
DAN AND I HAVE PLAYED THIS GAME
TOGETHER THE ENTIRE TIME, BUT

555
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:26,561
WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS YOU
ONLY BRING PEOPLE TO THE END YOU

556
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:29,022
FEEL YOU CAN BEAT.

557
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,774
THAT'S WHY NOURA SCARINGS ME.

558
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,400
IT WOULD BE EASY THE TAKE HER TO
THE END.

559
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,861
>> WHAT DOES YOUR HEART SAY?

560
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:38,406
KEEP THE PEACE?

561
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,075
>> WHY DON'T WE DO THAT?

562
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:46,581
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

563
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,625
>> I KNOW JANET WILL BE ON
BOARD.

564
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:54,422
>> SO IF JANET, MYSELF AND
ELAINE DECIDE TO VOTE FOR NOURA,

565
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,800
SHE'S GOING HOME, BECAUSE DAN IS
ALSO VOTING FOR NOURA.

566
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:57,926
THAT GIVES US FOUR.

567
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,135
I NEED TO START BUILDING A
RESUME.

568
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:03,264
AND I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT I CAN BRING TO THE JURY.

569
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,309
THAT'S LIKE DO I WANT TO BE A
SURVIVOR PLAYER THAT LAYS LOW,

570
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,937
OR DO I WANT TO BE ONE THAT
MAKES MOVES LIKE THE PEOPLE I

571
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:13,108
ADMIRE, LIKE SANDRA.

572
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,025
>> I'M IN THE IN TROUBLE AM I?

573
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,445
>> NO.

574
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:17,779
NOT AT ALL.

575
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:18,446
>> OKAY.

576
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:23,284
I BELIEVE IN YOU.

577
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,954
>> SEE WHAT I MEAN?

578
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:26,996
>> CAN YOU TELL?

579
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,497
>> YEAH.

580
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:33,128
>> SO WHAT DO WE DO?

581
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:36,965
>> NOURA DOES ALL THE SCHEMING
AND I THINK THAT IF I WANT TO

582
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:40,468
REMOVE NOURA FROM THE
POSSIBILITY OF GOING TO FINAL

583
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,886
THREE, BECAUSE I WANT TO BE
THERE.

584
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:46,141
AND PEOPLE MAY WANT TO TAKE
NOURA INSTEAD.

585
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:50,061
IF ELAINE WAS TO STAY, I THINK
MY THREAT LEVEL IS RALLY

586
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,981
DIMINISHED, BECAUSE ONE, SHE CAN
START FIRE PROBABLY AS FAST AS F

587
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:57,777
NOT FASTER THAN I CAN, AND, TWO
SHE CAN WIN IMMUNITY, AND THREE,

588
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,696
SHE'S A LIKABLE PLAYER.

589
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:00,864
BUT THAT MAKES HER DANGEROUS.

590
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:04,159
SO TONIGHT'S A TRICKY VOTE.

591
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,454
AND LAUREN AND MYSELF ARE THE
ONES IN CHARGE MAKING A

592
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,539
DECISION.

593
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,892
>> DEAN.

594
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:32,187
DEAN WON IT.

595
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:42,280
>> Jeff: WE NOW BRING IN THE
MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

596
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:56,961
>> Jeff: WE NOW BRING IN THE
MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

597
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:57,879
ALL RIGHT.

598
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,047
LET'S START WITH TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

599
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,883
ELAINE, YOU'RE ALREADY SHAKING
YOUR HEAD.

600
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:05,553
>> I WAS PISSED BECAUSE I HAD
IT, AND THIS DUDE BACK HERE,

601
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,055
YEAH, HE BEAT ME TO THE PUNCH.

602
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,223
LIKE I NEEDED THAT.

603
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,390
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

604
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,308
I REALLY NEEDED THAT.

605
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,060
>> I FELT LIKE I WAS IN A
CONVERSATION, TOO.

606
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:16,898
JUST TAKE A LOOK AT WHO HAS BEEN
VOTED OUT RECENTLY, KARISHMA,

607
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:17,565
ELIZABETH.

608
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,401
>> DEAN IS PLAYING FOR THE JURY.

609
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,402
HE PAID ATTENTION.

610
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,821
>> I WAS SITTING HERE WITH FIVE
PURPLE FOLKS.

611
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:27,617
>> Jeff: SO NOURA, WHERE ARE
WE IN THE GAME RIGHT NOW?

612
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:32,247
>> AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

613
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:32,622
>> Jeff: TRUE.

614
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,791
GOOD ANSWER.

615
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:39,128
>> RIGHT NOW IT'S KIND OF THE
END IS IN SIGHT, AND PEOPLE ARE

616
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:43,091
THINKING, HOW DO I GET BY ONE
MORE DAY, BUT HOW DO I END UP AT

617
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,300
THE END.

618
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,178
SO IT'S LIKE, THESE TWO THINGS
ARE HAPPENING, BUT IT'S CHANGING

619
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,429
CONSTANTLY.

620
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,099
>> Jeff: TOMMY, PLAYERS OFTEN
TALK ABOUT SEVEN.

621
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,059
WHEN THERE'S SEVEN LEFT, THAT'S
A PIVOTAL MOMENT.

622
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,227
>> EXACTLY.

623
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,814
BECAUSE WHEN THERE ARE SEVEN
EMPLOYERS LEFT, YOU ONLY NEED

624
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:00,984
FOUR PEOPLE TO SWITCH THE TIDE
AND CHANGE ALLIANCES.

625
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:05,738
SO IF THESE TWO FEEL LIKE
THEY'RE ON THE BOTTOM, THEY ONLY

626
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:09,325
HAVE TO FIND TWO PEOPLE WHO FEEL
LIKE THEY'RE ON THE VOKAI BOTTOM

627
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,868
AND THEY CAN MAKE SOMETHING
WORK.

628
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,161
>> Jeff: SO DAN, IT'S STILL A
VERY DANGEROUS GAME RIGHT NOW.

629
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,998
>> EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE ONLY
SEVEN, THERE ARE STILL SEVEN.

630
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:20,795
>> WHERE I COME FROM IN
CALIFORNIA, YOU HOPE YOU BUILD A

631
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:23,631
FOUNDATION TO WITHSTAND AN
EARTHQUAKE.

632
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:27,093
LOOKING AT OUR LAST TRIBAL, OUR
FOUNDATION HAD AN EARTHQUAKE.

633
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:30,096
WHEN PEOPLE FIX THE FOUNDATION,
YOU MAKE IT STRONG ENOUGH SO THE

634
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,849
NEXT EARTHQUAKE YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT.

635
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:36,144
SO UNLESS THIS IS THE BIG ONE
TONIGHT, WE HOPE OUR HOUSE IS

636
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,313
SOLID AND THE VOTE WILL BE WHAT
WE EXPECT.

637
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,148
>> Jeff: ELAINE, I GUESS
YOU'RE NOT A MEMBER OF THIS

638
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:40,815
HOUSE.

639
00:31:40,898 --> 00:31:43,776
>> I GUESS I'M A HOME WRECKER.

640
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,653
THAT'S WHAT I'M UP HERE CALLING
MYSELF.

641
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,698
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS: I HAVE
BEEN CALLED TARGET FROM DAY ONE

642
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,116
FROM MY OWN PEEPS OVER ON LAIRO.

643
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:54,454
SO WHY NOT JUST HANG ON THE ME
ONE MORE VOTE JUST TO GUARANTEE

644
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,664
YOURSELF ONE MORE SPOT.

645
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,207
>> ELAINE, THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

646
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,126
>> YOU'RE SAYING, HANG ON THE
YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE MORE LIKELY

647
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:03,129
TO BE VOTED OUT BEFORE SOMEBODY
ELSE BECAUSE YOU'RE A THREAT?

648
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,131
>> EXACTLY.

649
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,216
>> Jeff: SO IF IT'S NOT YOU,
WHO DO YOU PUT IT ON?

650
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:13,306
>> WELL, MY VOTE WOULD GO TO
NOURA.

651
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,224
>> Jeff: IMPLYING SHE'S NOT A
THREAT TO WIN.

652
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,185
>> NEW YORK I THINK SHE'S
SOMEBODY YOU CAN TAKE TO THE

653
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:21,522
END, BUT IF SHE GOES TO THE END,
THEN JANET IS OUT.

654
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,317
IF SHE GOES TO THE END, THEN
LAUREN MIGHT BE OUT.

655
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,528
SO BY VOTING ME OUT AND KEEPING
HER, YOU'RE MAYBE TAKING A SEAT

656
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,655
AWAY FROM YOURSELF.

657
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:31,532
>> WHO WANTS TO SIT NEXT TO
ELAINE IN THE FINAL THREE?

658
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,909
RAISE YOUR HAND?

659
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,035
>> NOBODY.

660
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,871
BUT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO GO
WITH ME BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'M

661
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:39,832
GOING HOME THAN TO PLAY WITH YOU
WHERE YOU'RE A WILD CARD.

662
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,876
>> YOU'RE ENTITLED TO YOUR
PERSPECTIVE.

663
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:43,753
AND I GET YOU'RE ON THE OUTSIDE.

664
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,046
DEAN IS IMMUNE AND YOU HAVE TO
COME UP WITH SOMETHING.

665
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:48,383
>> I'M NOT COMING UP WITH
NOTHING.

666
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,550
I'M TELLING IT LIKE IT IS.

667
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:53,054
IF YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE
YOU NEXT, YOU BETTER DO

668
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:53,888
SOMETHING TONIGHT.

669
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:55,556
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE
CHANCE.

670
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,267
>> JANET, ELAINE MADE ANOTHER
INTERESTING POINT.

671
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:02,355
SHE IS SAYING, IFeOe=U
ME OUT BECAUSE I'M A THREAT,

672
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:05,066
THEN ANY OTHER THREAT BETTER
FEAR THE SAME THING.

673
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,359
>> YEAH.

674
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:09,862
ELAINE AND I HAVE A VERY SIMILAR
PEOPLE VIEW HER AS A THREAT AND

675
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,739
PEOPLE VIEW ME AS A THREAT.

676
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,742
EVERYTHING THAT LABOR IS SAYING,
SHE COULD BE SAYING ABOUT ME.

677
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,120
AND EVERYBODY UP HERE KNOWS
YOU KNOW, SO IT'S A LOT TO THINK

678
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,205
ABOUT.

679
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,249
>> Jeff: LAUREN, YOU SEEM TO
BE IN AGREEMENT.

680
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:26,879
>> ELAINE HAS RAISED SOME VERY
REAL CONCERNS THAT I DO HAVE

681
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,756
ABOUT MY POSITION HERE.

682
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,757
AND JANET'S POSITION HERE.

683
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,218
>> Jeff: ELAINE, THIS IS WHAT
YOU WANT TO HEAR?

684
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:35,763
>> BUT I ALWAYS PREPARE FOR THE
WORST, BECAUSE FOR ME THAT'S

685
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:36,597
WHAT USUALLY HAPPENS.

686
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,182
THE GLASS IS ALWAYS HALF EMPTY
WITH ME.

687
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,934
>> Jeff: REALLY?

688
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:41,185
>> YEAH.

689
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,312
>> Jeff: THAT DOESN'T LINE UP
FOR ME JUST KNOWING AND WATCHING

690
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:43,980
YOU OUT HERE.

691
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,732
YOU DO SEEM LIKABLE.

692
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:46,816
YOU DO SEEM CHARMING.

693
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,401
YOU DO SEEM LIKE A THREAT TO
WIN.

694
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:51,112
AND YET YOU SEE THE WORLD SO
HALF EMPTY.

695
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:54,949
>> I MEAN, I'VE HAD A ROUGH WAY
TO GO, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

696
00:33:55,032 --> 00:33:57,285
I HAVE NEVER BEEN A REAL LUCKY
PERSON.

697
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,955
JUST UNLUCKY FOR SOME REASON,
OTHER THAN GETTING ON THIS,

698
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:02,457
NOTHING GOOD HAS EVER REALLY
HAPPENED.

699
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,293
AND I COME FOR THE MONEY, BUT
THE MORE IMPORTANT PART WAS

700
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,129
COMING FOR THE ADVENTURE AND
FIGURING OUT WHO I WAS AND

701
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:13,134
DEALING WITH MY EMOTIONS AND,
YOU KNOW, JUST TRYING TO PUT

702
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,302
EVERYTHING INTO PERSPECTIVE.

703
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,262
DAMN, JEFF.

704
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,473
GOD.

705
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:22,018
>> Jeff: WELL, HAVE YOU HAD
ANY PERSPECTIVE OUT HERE?

706
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:25,772
>> I JUST COME OUT HERE AND I
HAD A LOT OF STUFF ON MY MIND

707
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:26,981
ALREADY.

708
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,358
MY MOM PASSED AWAY THREE MONTHS
AGO, AN I'VE HOMICIDE A LOT OF

709
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,652
LONG NIGHTS.

710
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:36,657
TRYING TO WORK THROUGH ALL THAT
AND NOT GETTING LOST IN MY OWN

711
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:42,872
SELF, YOU KNOW, I GOT A GOOD
GIRLFRIEND WHO IS THERE WITH ME,

712
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:43,331
AND TIME IS WHAT I NEED.

713
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,875
I NEED TIME.

714
00:34:45,958 --> 00:35:00,014
BECAUSE TIME HEALS ALL WOUNDS.

715
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:05,520
A BIG LESSON I'VE LEARNED COMING
OUT HERE IS I SHOULDN'T TAKE

716
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,562
ANYTHING FOR GRANTED BECAUSE YOU
NEVER KNOW.

717
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:12,527
SO I'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR 35
DAYS TO STAY IN THIS.

718
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,488
AND I'M GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING
UNTIL YOU SNUFF MY TORCH.

719
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,447
THAT'S JUST HOW IT IS.

720
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,866
>> Jeff: I DON'T WANT TO SNUFF
ANYBODY'S TORCH.

721
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,701
IT'S NEVER FUN.

722
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,953
>> I KNOW.

723
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:25,039
>> JEFF, JUST HAVING A FEW MORE
DAYS ON THIS EARTH THAN SOME OF

724
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:29,252
THE PEOPLE HERE, THERE ARE TIMES
IN MY LIFE THAT I COULDN'T

725
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:33,172
UNDERSTAND THE TRAGEDY, I
COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PAIN,

726
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:37,218
BUT I ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT THERE
WAS LIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE.

727
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:42,390
YOU ARE GOING TO FIND YOUR WAY
THROUGH YOUR PERSONAL FEELINGS,

728
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:46,727
WHETHER YOU STAY HERE OR WHETHER
YOU CLOSE IT OUT, THAT'S

729
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:52,567
SECONDARY TO WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN UP HERE AND IN HERE.

730
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,569
AND I TRULY BELIEVE THAT FOR
YOU.

731
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,571
I TRULY DO.

732
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,405
>> APPRECIATE IT.

733
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,283
>> WE LOVE YOU, ELAINE.

734
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:03,411
>> THAT MAKES ME NOT WANT THE
LEAVE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

735
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:08,082
YOUR DREAMS ARE STILL ALIVE
UNTIL YOU SNUFF MORE TORCH.

736
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:09,292
>> NOO THAT IS TRUE.

737
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:12,753
AND IT IS...

738
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,630
>> TIME TO VOTE?

739
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:15,923
>> Jeff: THAT'S RIGHT.

740
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,009
NOURA, YOU'RE UP.

741
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,032
>> YOU'RE CRAZY AS HELL, BUT I
STILL LIKE YOU.

742
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,428
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

743
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,445
>> Jeff: THE ANYBODY HAS A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU

744
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,864
WANT THE PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE
THE TIME TO DO SO.

745
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:22,365
OKAY.

746
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:26,953
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

747
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:30,498
FIRST VOTE, ELAINE.

748
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:34,794
NOURA.

749
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:38,506
ELAINE.

750
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:44,011
TWO VOTES ELAINE.

751
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:44,470
NOURA.

752
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:45,680
WE'RE TIED.

753
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:50,393
TWO VOTES ELAINE, TWO VOTES
NOURA.

754
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:56,691
THAT'S THREE VOTES ELAINE, TWO
VOTES NOURA.

755
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,068
14th PERSON VOTED OUT,
ELAINE, THAT'S FOUR, THAT'S

756
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,195
ENOUGH, YOU NEED TO BRING ME
YOUR TORCH.

757
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,498
>> DON'T WORRY.

758
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:16,293
I'M GOOD.

759
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:25,428
ALL RIGHT, PEEPS.

760
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:33,686
>> Jeff: ELAINE, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

761
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,062
>> LET'S HUG IT OUT.

762
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,689
>> Jeff: YOU GOT IT.

763
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,566
>> I LOVE HER.

764
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:48,617
>> LOVE Y'ALL.

765
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:53,039
>> Jeff: WELL, IT'S BEEN 35
PHYSICALLY TAXING, EMOTIONALLY

766
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,206
DRAINING DAYS.

767
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,709
AND IF YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO
GET ANY EASIER, THINK AGAIN.

768
00:38:56,792 --> 00:39:05,259

CAMP, GOOD NIGHT.

HOME.

>> UH-HUH.

775
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:36,665
>> THERE WAS ONE NIGHT I WAS
FIXING THE FIRE, AND I COULDN'T

776
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:37,708
SEE IT WAS SO DARK.

777
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,627
OH, MY GOD.

778
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,795
JEFF'S HERE.

779
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,964
>> WE'RE ALL HANGING OUT
RELAXING, AND I SEE JEFF.

780
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,634
AND I LITERAL THINK I LOOKED AT
HIM LIKE, THIS LIKE A DEER

781
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:50,012
CAUGHT IN THE HEADLIGHTS BECAUSE
I WAS SO CONFUSED.

782
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:53,474
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON.

783
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,225
ALL RIGHT.

784
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:54,809
SO.

785
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,143
I NEED TO SHARE SOME NEWS.

786
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,812
>> GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS, WHAT?

787
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,647
PI MATTER IS POUNDING.

788
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,106
>> BAD NEWS.

789
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,315
>> WHERE'S DAN?

790
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:05,319
>> I SPOKE PRIVATELY WITH DAN,
AND I WANT TO UPDATE YOU GUYS.

791
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:08,614
A DECISION HAS BEEN MADE, AND
DAN WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO THE

792
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:09,365
GAME.

793
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,617
HE WON'T BE COMING BACK THE
CAMP.

794
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,036
HE WON'T BE ON THE JURY.

795
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,871
HE'S GONE.

796
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,374
>> DAN HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE
GAME.

797
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:21,085
NOT EVEN GO TO THE JURY,
NOTHING.

798
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:25,256
SO IN MY OPINION, VERY
REAL-WORLD THINGS ARE COMING

799
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:29,677
INTO THE GAME, AND WE NEED TO
PROCESS THE FACT THAT DAN IS

800
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:36,016
GONE, BUT THEN MOVE BEYOND IT.

801
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,520
>> LOSING THE WRONG PERSON AT
THE WRONG TIME CAN BLOW UP YOUR

802
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,021
CHANCES FOR $1 MILLION.

803
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,690
NOW THE DECK HAS RESCRAMBLED.

804
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:46,735
I NOW HAVE TO PICK THE CARDS UP
AND GET GOING, BECAUSE THIS GAME

805
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:53,242
DOESN'T STOP FOR ANYBODY.

806
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,838
>> STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM
OUR NEXT EPISODE.

807
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:10,718
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON THE
SEASON FINALE OF "SURVIVOR,"

808
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:17,391
PREPARE FOR BATTLE, BECAUSE IT'S
A FIGHT TO THE FINISH.

809
00:41:17,474 --> 00:41:18,726
>> D.K. CHILLEN HAS TURNED TO
D.K. VILLAIN.

810
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:19,727
>> I HAVE A FREAKIN' IDOL.

811
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:20,936
I NEED THE USE IT.

812
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:25,399
>> THERE'S IN WAY WE'RE GOING TO
LEAVE THEM WITHOUT ONE LAST

813
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:26,108
TEST.

814
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,234
>> Jeff: JOIN US DECEMBER
18th.

815
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,905
>> OTHER THAN WINNING THE $1
MILLION, I'VE EXPERIENCED

816
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,448
EVERYTHING YOU COULD EXPERIENCE
ON "SURVIVOR."

817
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,742
YOU HAVE TO COME OUT HERE AND
LOOK YOURSELF IN THE EYE.

818
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:42,750
SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T LIKE WHAT
THEY SEE, BUT I LOVE ME.

819
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:43,751
I'M PROUD OF ME.

820
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:44,585
I REALLY AM.

821
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,463
IT IS SOMETHING I'LL ALWAYS
REMEMBER.
