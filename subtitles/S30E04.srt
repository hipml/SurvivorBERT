00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:10,051
MAX WERE BECOMING OUTCASTS.

00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:13,054
>> THEY'RE RELENTLESS, BUZZING

00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,222
IN YOUR EAR, AND YOU'RE JUST

7
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:15,682
LIKE, GOD.

8
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:17,934
>> Jeff: WHILE AT THE

9
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:18,518
BLUE-COLLAR TRIBE, IT WAS ALL

10
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:19,102
WORK AND NO PLAY.

11
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:23,231
>> HOW DO YOU [BLEEPED] THINK

12
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:24,983
THIS FIRE IS GOING RIGHT NOW,

13
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:25,191
MAGIC?

14
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:25,775
>> THIS BLUE-COLLAR TRIBE IS

15
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:26,401
FAILING.

16
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:28,319
>> Jeff: AT THE LAST IMMUNITY

17
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,655
CHALLENGE, WILL STRUGGLED.

18
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,158
NINA WAS LEFT OUT, AND NO COLLAR

19
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,242
LOST THEIR SECOND CHALLENGE IN A

20
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:35,785

21
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,495
WHITE COLLAR WINS IMMUNITY,

SENDING NO COLLAR BACK THE

23
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:41,499
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

24
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:46,379
AT TRIBAL COUNCIL... WILL.

25
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,255
WILL RECEIVED TWO VOTES, BUT IT

26
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:50,675
WAS NINA WHO JUST DIDN'T FIT

27
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,845
INCH NINA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

28
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:54,596
15 ARE LEFT.

29
00:00:54,679 --> 00:01:03,229
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

30
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:14,532
[THUNDER]

31
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,996
>> NINA SAW WHAT WAS COMING TO

32
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:20,705
HER, FINALLY.

33
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,831
SENT HER ON HOME.

34
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,625
BUT IT WAS PRETTY DELIGHTFUL TO

35
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:24,292
COME BACK TO CAMP AND SEE EMBERS

36
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,794
IN THE FIRE.

37
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,837
THAT WAS A SHINING HOPE, YOU

38
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,421
KNOW.

39
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,089
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH DARKEST AND

40
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,883
NOW WE HAVE OUR EMBERS AND WE

41
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:32,467
HAVE OUR FIRE JUST BLAZING.

42
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,261
>> IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING WHY

43
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,180
YOUR NAME CAME UP TWICE, THAT

44
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:41,226
WAS ONLY IN CASE NINA HAD THE

45
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:41,851
IDOL.

46
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:42,352
NO ONE WANTED YOU GONE.

47
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,229
>> NEW YORK I KNOW.

48
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,564
YOU GUYS STAYED TRUE TO THE

49
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,566
ALLIANCE, AND I TOLD YOU I WAS

50
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,275
LOYAL.

51
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,027
YOU GUYS SHOWED ME YOU'RE LOYAL.

52
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,321
NOW IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT GAME.

53
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,155
WE ARE DEFINITELY AT THE

54
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,949
MAKE-OR-BREAK POINT.

55
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:56,491
WE HAVE THE MENTALITY OF A

56
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:57,909
STRONG UNIT NOW.

57
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,536
THIS IS THE UNIT WE WANTED IN

58
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,204
THE BEGINNING, BUT I GOT TWO

59
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:01,663
VOTES.

60
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,706
IF WE LOSE THE NEXT CHALLENGE

61
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,292
AND GO TRIBAL COUNCIL, I'M GONE,

62
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,210
UNLESS I CAN CONVINCE JOE TO

63
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:15,343
VOTE ONE OF THE GIRLS, I'M GONE.

64
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:23,935
>> I AM STARVING.

65
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:24,936
>> OH, YEAH.

66
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,187
>> GET THE MACHETE.

67
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,522
>> OH, YEAH.

68
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,106
OH, YEAH.

69
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:28,940
>> HELL, YEAH.

70
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,567
>> SPREAD IT OUT SO YOU DON'T

71
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,359
CUT IT IN HALF.

72
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,652
THERE YOU GO, MIKE.

73
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:33,194
GET HIM.

74
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:33,403
GET HIM.

75
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,071
THAT ABOY.

76
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,575
THAT ABOY, MIKE.

77
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,785
>> WE'RE STILL UNABLE TO GET A

78
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,162
FISH, WHICH IS BREAKING MY HEART

79
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:43,913
A LITTLE BIT.

80
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,414
WE'RE NOT GETTING CHICKEN

81
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:48,001
OBVIOUSLY.

82
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,586
ARE YOU GROSSED OUT EASILY?

83
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,045
I WANT YOU TO GRAB THIS.

84
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,006
BUT WE'VE BEEN SEEING A COUPLE

85
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,048
SNAKES THROUGHOUT CAMP, AND WE

86
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:58,887
HAVE GOT A SNAKE.

87
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,637
HERE WE GO.

88
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,598
>> IT'S STILL MOVING.

90
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,476
YOU KNOW, YOUR BOY FROM TEXAS IS

00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,020
GOING TO EAT IT, I DON'T CARE

92
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,438

SNAKE.

95
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:17,614
IT DON'T MATTER.

96
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,823
SNAKE'S READY.

I'LL DO WHATEVER I CAN TO GET

I'M A BIG TODAY.

101
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,371
I'M PROBABLY ONE OF THE BIGGER

DUDES OUT HERE.

103
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,624
I HAVE TO DO WHAT I HAVE TO DO

104
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,291
TO SURVIVE.

105
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,043
IT TASTES PRETTY GOOD.

106
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:30,627
I'LL EAT ANYTHING.

107
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,878
I'M EATING THINGS I NEVER

108
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,004

WE HAD A HEATED ARGUMENT EARLIER

114
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:43,681
IN THE GAME.

115
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,808

>> I NEVER SPENT A BIRTHDAY AWAY

537
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,103
FROM MY FAMILY, AND I MEAN I

538
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,106
KNOW IT'S A GAME, BUT THEY WENT

539
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,526
OUT OF THEIR WAY TO MAKE SURE I

540
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,738
HAD A SPECIAL 42nd BIRTHDAY.

541
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,239
TOP THIS BIRTHDAY OFF WITH A

542
00:15:49,323 --> 00:16:01,210
LITTLE FRIED CHICKEN.

543
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,044

NOW?

545
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,047
IT'S ONLY GOING TO MAKE IT

546
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:05,798
HARDER, RIGHT?

547
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,132
>> WE DON'T HAVE TO EAT THEM.

548
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,634
>> WE'RE GOING TO EAT THEM.

549
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:12,930
>> BUT THEY HAVE EGGS.

550
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,890
>> BACK HOME I DON'T EAT MEAT.

551
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:16,558
I DON'T LIKE HURTING ANIMALS.

552
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,060
I DON'T SEE THE PURPOSE IN

553
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,103
KILLING THIS CHICKEN.

554
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,313
IT PROVIDES US WITH EGGS.

555
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,439
BUT THEY DON'T CARE.

556
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,857
THEY'RE DEAD SET ON EATING THIS

557
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:24,233
CHICKEN.

558
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,693
>> SORRY, BABY GIRL.

559
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:26,985
>> YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE?

560
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:34,076
>> NOPE.

561
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,996
>> I THINK JENN'S TOTALLY JUST

562
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,288
STARVED.

563
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,123
>> PROBABLY.

564
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:48,132
>> WILL YOU CUT IT?

565
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,384
>> EVERYONE'S AT THE CAMP

566
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:54,012
COOKING AND KILLING AND GUTTING

567
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:54,555
WHATEVER-ING THE CHICKEN.

568
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,222
>> WHERE'S JENN?

569
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,182
JENN CAN'T HANDLE IT.

570
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,184
>> IT REALLY BOTHERS ME TO SEE

571
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,144
THAT.

572
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,895
I'M OUT GOING FIREWOOD.

573
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,441
OF COURSE I'LL POKE AROUND FOR

574
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,569
THE IDOL, BUT MY CONFIDENCE FOR

575
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,821
FINDING IT IS ABOUT 10%.

576
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:11,447
ALL THESE TREES LOOK THE SAME.

577
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,075
WITH NO CLUE, IT'S A NEEDLE IN A

578
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:15,993
HAYSTACK-TYPE DEAL.

579
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,619
BUT HISTORICALLY THE IMMUNITY

580
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,203
IDOL IS IN THE DRY CREEK BED,

581
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,080
LIKE IN THE WALL OR SOMETHING,

582
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,915
OR IT'S GOING TO BE IN A TREE.

583
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,459
IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE IN A

584
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:23,625
TREE.

585
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,294
>> OH, THIS IS GOING TO BE

586
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,379
AWESOME.

587
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:27,921
CHICKEN.

588
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,174
SO EXCITED.

589
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,633
WILL'S BIRTHDAY, BIRTHDAY FEAST.

590
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,929
>> BIRTHDAY FEAST FOR WILL.

591
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,181
>> IT'S USUALLY A UNIQUE-LOOKING

592
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,223
TREE, SOMETHING THAT MAKES THEM

593
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:42,186
STAND OUT A LITTLE BIT.

594
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,897
>> JENN'S BEEN GONE FREAKIN'

595
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,689
FOREVER.

596
00:17:45,773 --> 00:18:01,163
>> THIS IS SO GOOD.

597
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:05,834
>> NO, FREAKING WAY.

598
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,377
THIS IS LIKE A DREAM COME TRUE.

599
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,003
I DID IT.

600
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:10,339
I HAVE A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.

601
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,799
THIS IS AMAZING.

602
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,384
I THINK IF I WERE ON THE BLUE OR

603
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,011
WHITE-COLLAR TRIBE I WOULD BE

604
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:16,637
WORRIED BECAUSE IT'S OUR PEOPLE,

605
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,388
THE NO COLLARS THAT STIR THINGS

606
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,306
UP AND MESS UP THE GAME.

607
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,433
I CAN SCREW UP THE GAME SO

608
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,477
EASILY WITH THIS THING.

609
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,728
I GUESS KILLING THE CHICKEN KIND

610
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,397
OF WORKED OUT FOR ME.

611
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:43,288
WINNER, WINNER, CHICKEN DINNER.

612
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:49,002
>> THE GIRL, KEL, KEL, GOT

613
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:49,545
KNOCKED IN THE HEAD TODAY.

614
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,672
SHE ENDED UP GETTING SIX

615
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:52,089
STITCHES.

616
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,799
THIS IS ONE OF THE TOUGHEST

617
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:57,427
GIRLS I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME,

618
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,637
SO FITTING THE STEREOTYPE OF A

619
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,471
BLUE COLLAR.

620
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,389
I HAVE MAD RESPECT FOR THAT AND

621
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,183
I FEEL LIKE WE COULD GO REALLY,

622
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:03,684
REALLY FAR IN THIS GAME

623
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:09,857
TOGETHER.

624
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,191
>> OH, MY GOSH.

625
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,610
>> WHAT?

626
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,319
>> GIRLS NEED TO HOLD THEMSELVES

627
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,780
TO A HIGHER STANDARD THAN GUYS.

628
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,782
>> THAT'S SUCH CRAZY LOGIC TO

629
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:19,116
ME.

630
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,409
>> LISTEN, HOW MANY TIMES...

631
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,703
>> YOU BROKE IT DOWN.

632
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,246
YOU BROKE IT DOWN.

633
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,748
>> NO, NO, NO, IF A GIRL BROKE

634
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,876
UP WITH A GUY, A GUY WOULD BE

635
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:29,543
LINING UP.

636
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,045
IF I GO TO A CLUB, I JUST BROKE

637
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,755
UP WITH MY GIRL, I HAVE TO PUT

638
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:33,964
IN WORK.

639
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,883
>> THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

640
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,217
>> I SAY IF YOU GO TO A CLUB,

641
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,845
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

642
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:40,095
GETTING.

643
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:42,681
>> THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T MEET

644
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:43,098
PEOPLE AT THE CLUB.

645
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,475
>> OR THE CAR OR THE CARNIVAL OR

646
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:45,767
A MUSEUM.

647
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,979
>> IF YOU WERE MY SON I'D BREAK

648
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:49,271
YOUR JAW.

649
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,064
>> WELL, MY MOTHER'S PROUD OF

650
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:51,315
ME.

651
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,399
>> THERE'S SO MUCH WRONG WITH

652
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,442
YOU.

653
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,736
>> RODNEY THINKS THAT WOMEN NEED

654
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:56,945
TO HOLD THEMSELVES TO A HIGHER

655
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,071
STANDARD THAN MEN, WHICH IS

656
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,198
WHAT'S WRONG WITH SO MANY

657
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:00,782
RELATIONSHIPS, BECAUSE GUYS

658
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,701
THINK THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO

659
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,912
THINGS THAT A WOMAN CAN'T, AND

660
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,080
IT'S HARD TO LIVE WITH SOMEONE

661
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,541
SO CLOSELY WHO HAS SUCH

662
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,543
DIFFERENT VIEWS BECAUSE I LOOK

663
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,086
AT SOMEONE LIKE THAT, AND I'M

664
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:13,545
LIKE, WHO RAISED YOU?

665
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,756
LIKE WHAT TYPE OF WOMAN WOULD

666
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,799
RAISE A MAN TO THINK THAT?

667
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:18,842
THE BOTTOM LINE IS EVERYONE IS

668
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,260
ON THE EQUAL PLAYING FEED, AND

669
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,845
IF YOU THINK WOMEN SHOULD HOLD

670
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:22,930
THEMSELVES TO A HIGHER STANDARD,

671
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,890
THEN YOU SHOULD HOLD YOURSELF TO

672
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,100
A HIGHER STANDARD.

673
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:27,851
>> ALL RIGHT.

674
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,478
FIRST OF ALL, LINDSEY, SHE LOOKS

675
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,104
LIKE A FEMALE MIKE TYSON OUT

676
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:31,355
HERE.

677
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,190
WHO THE HELL GETS A TATTOO ON

678
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,025
THEIR DAMN FACE UNLESS YOU GOT

679
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:35,901
SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS?

680
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,402
YOU CAN TELL SHE'S GOT SOME

681
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,737
SERIOUS PROBLEMS HAVING A MIKE

682
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,071
TYSON TATTOO.

683
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,948
>> IS THAT HOW YOUR MOM RAISED

684
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:41,406
YOU?

685
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,824
THAT'S HOW YOUR MOM RAISED YOU?

686
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,534
>> ALL I WAS TRYING TO SAY IS I

687
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,786
THINK GIRLS SHOULD HOLD

688
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,329
THEMSELVES TO A HIGHER STANDARD

689
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,705
THAN MEN.

690
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,581
MEN ARE DOGS.

691
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,999
WE WANT ANGELS.

692
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,960
THAT'S HOW ME AND MY BOYS ARE.

693
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,380
I MIGHT NOT BE AN ANGEL.

694
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,256
THAT'S WHAT I WANT WHEN I SETTLE

695
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:58,465
DOWN.

696
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,299
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

697
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,384
>> IT IS WHAT IT IS.

698
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,344
>> I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE

699
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,555
FIGHTING OVER SOMETHING SO

700
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:05,806
STUPID.

701
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,016
>> SO I GOT TO GO BACK TO MY

702
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,811
THREE Cs -- COOL, CALM AND

703
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:11,353
CHECKED.

704
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,938
I CAN'T BE A HOTHEAD IN THIS

705
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:13,146
GAME.

706
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:13,522
THAT'S WHO I AM.

707
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,439
I'M A HOTHEAD.

708
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:25,826
THAT WILL SEND ME OUT, TOO.

709
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,452
>> EGGS.

710
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,914
>> THERE ARE TEN EGGS.

711
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,416
>> THE CHICKENS WOULD HAVE BEEN

712
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:32,708
DELICIOUS.

713
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,669
>> LISTEN, WE GOT EGGS.

714
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:36,503
>> I'M KIND OF THRILLED THAT WE

715
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,006
DIDN'T WIN THE WHOLE CHICKEN

716
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,257
PACKAGE JUST BECAUSE I KNEW THAT

717
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,675
WAS GOING TO BE YET ANOTHER

718
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:42,384
WHITE COLLAR NIGHTMARE.

719
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,386
I KNOW THAT NONE OF MY GUYS HAVE

720
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,679
EVER SLAUGHTERED ANY KIND OF AN

721
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,431
ANIMAL LET ALONE A CHICKEN.

722
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:50,892
I LEARNED HOW THE KILL A CHICKEN

723
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,393
FOR "SURVIVOR."

724
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,811
I WATCHED A VIDEO AND TALKED TO

725
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,354
A FARMER ALL ABOUT IT AND THEN I

726
00:21:54,438 --> 00:22:00,152
SLAUGHTERED A RABBIT.

727
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,403
IT'S DIFFERENT, VERY DIFFERENT,

728
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,155
BUT IT DESSENSTIZES YOU.

729
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,198
>> SHIRIN SAYS SHE SLAUGHTERED A

730
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:05,532
BUNNY RABBIT.

731
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,826
REALLY?

732
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:08,452
FIRST THING THAT CAME TO MY MIND

733
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:08,952
WAS SOSA PATH.

734
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,746
FIRST THING THEY START DOING IS

735
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,664
KILLING SMALL ANIMALS.

736
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,332
IT PROBABLY STARTED WITH A MOUSE

737
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,917
AT LIKE 14.

738
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,502
SHE'S AT A RABBIT RIGHT NOW AT

739
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,795
29.

740
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,964
IT'S INSANE HOW SHE TRIES TO

741
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,174
JUSTIFY HER PSYCHOTIC WAYS.

742
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:26,511
ALL RIGHT, PSYCHO, YOU SIT OVER

743
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,596
THERE.

744
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,475
>> I PREFER TO, YOU KNOW, PUSH

745
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,935
SOMETHING, NOT PUNCH SOMETHING.

746
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,355
>> LISTEN, THE CHALLENGE WILL

747
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,815
DICTATE WHICH ONE, BUT I'M JUST

748
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,942
MORE CONCERNED IF THE FOUR OF US

749
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,652
COMPETE AND SHE'S IN DOUBT, IS

750
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,114
SHE GOING TO FEEL ALIENATED AND

751
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:46,698
WHEN WE COME BACK TO CAMP...

752
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,866
>> WHAT WOULD BE THE DIFFERENCE

753
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:52,454
IF I SAT OUT?

754
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,372
>> YOU'RE THE LOGICAL PERSON.

755
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,249
>> SO IS THAT THE LOGIC FOR

756
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:56,833
SITTING ME OUT?

757
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,168
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

758
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,503
>> IT MIGHT BE THAT I SIT OUT.

759
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,672
>> IT DEPENDS ON... I GUESS WE

760
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,299
WAIT UNTIL THEN.

761
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:07,886
>> MAX IS PITCHING I REALLY

762
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,429
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD SIT OUT

763
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:12,265
SHIRIN BECAUSE IT WILL UPSET

764
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:12,432

765
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,391
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

766
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,352
ON THE SPECTRUM OF CRAZY, I

767
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,437
THINK BOTH MAX AND SHIRIN ARE

768
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,772
VERY CLOSE TO 10.

769
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:19,606
I'M A BETTER ATHLETE SO WE'RE

770
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,441
GOING TO GIVE UP THE POTENTIAL

771
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,193
FOR WINNING BECAUSE WE HAVE TO

772
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,277
WORRY ABOUT WHETHER HER FEELINGS

773
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:24,653

774
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:25,946
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT HE BROUGHT

776
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,949
MAX WANTS TO BE<i> THE</i> CULT LEADER

777
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:29,449
OF OUR TRIBE.

778
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:32,327
SHIRIN GOES NAKED BECAUSE MAX

779
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:32,994
GOES NAKED.

780
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,288
SHE WOULD DRINK HIS KOOL-AID.

781
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,081
VERY DANGEROUS.

782
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:36,540
VERY, VERY DANGEROUS.

783
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:40,335

791
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:54,307
TO MAKE MOVES?

792
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,601

1015
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:49,931

>> IN THIS CHALLENGE RODNEY WAS

1077
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,878
THE FACTOR THAT SLOWED US DOWN.

1078
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:45,421
HE GOT STUCK AND LOOKED AT ME

1079
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,964
LIKE A LOST PUPPY.

1080
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,008
MY HORSES ARE MUCH SMARTER THAN

1081
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,134
RODNEY, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S

1082
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:50,760
COMPETITION DAY.

1083
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:54,722
AND FOR ME, IT'S NOT EVEN IN THE

1084
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,891
CHALLENGES BUT IN CAMP LIFE,

1085
00:32:56,974 --> 00:33:00,269
RODNEY'S JUST GOT TO GO.

1086
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,327

00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,833
PROUD I GOT YOU ON MY MATT THAT

1090
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:22,083
FIRST DAY.

1091
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:22,667
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1092
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,043
>> NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS

1093
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:24,585
TONIGHT.

1094
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,045
>> AGREED.

1095
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,630
100%.

1096
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,298
>> THIS IS WHAT WE'RE READY FOR.

1097
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,467
>> I WASN'T READY TO GO SEE

1098
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:31,884
PROBST, NOT EVEN.

1099
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,053
>> THIS LOSS COULD BE EXACTLY

1100
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,889
WHAT THE BLUE TRIBE NEEDED.

1101
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,933
YOU DO NOT KNOW WHO YOUR TRUE

1102
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:39,434
ALLIANCE IS UNTIL JEFF IS

1103
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:46,190
READING THOSE NAMES.

1104
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,651
>> SO IS IT ME?

1105
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,027
LET'S JUST GET RIGHT TO IT?

1106
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,029
>> ACTUALLY, I WANT TO TALK TO

1107
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:52,196
YOU.

1108
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:52,447
>> YEAH?

1109
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,991
>> RODNEY HAS MY VOTE.

1110
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,033
HE DOESN'T HAVE MORALS.

1111
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,160
HE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO...

1112
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,245
>> NO RESPECT FOR GIRLS.

1113
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,997
>> FOR WOMEN.

1114
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,835
I JUST HOPE THAT YOU'LL CONSIDER

1115
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:06,210
VOTING HIM OUT.

1116
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,128
>> THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO LISTEN,

1117
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,797
YOU CAN LISTEN LIKE A GUY, OR

1118
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:10,923
YOU LISTEN LIKE A GIRL.

1119
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,467
WHEN YOU LISTEN LIKE A GUY, YOU

1120
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,342
TRY SOLVE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE

1121
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,261
THAT'S WHAT WE DO, WE WANT TO

1122
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:15,845
FIX THINGS.

1123
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:18,097
WHEN YOU LISTEN LIKE A GIRL, YOU

1124
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,891
EMPATHIZE, YOU JUST NOD YOUR

1125
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:23,227
HEAD AND AGREE.

1126
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,938
I CAN'T DISAGREE WITH YOU.

1127
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:26,397
REALLY CAN'T.

1128
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,190
YOU JUST SMILE AND NOD, YES,

1129
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:30,401
DEAR, I UNDERSTAND, YOU'RE

1130
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:30,985
RIGHT.

1131
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:32,945
IF GETTING RID OF RODNEY HELPS

1132
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,072
TO BRING THIS TRIBE TOGETHER,

1133
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:35,323
I'M IN.

1134
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,824
>> I THINK IT WILL.

1135
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:37,325
>> IT WILL MAKE THE TRIBE

1136
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:37,784
STRONGER IN THE END.

1137
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:38,117
>> IT'S HUGE.

1138
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:41,204
>> I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT.

1139
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,330
I COMPLETELY AGREE.

1140
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:46,167
I THINK THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO

1141
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,628
GO.

1142
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:51,255
I AM SO MUCH SMARTER THAN I

1143
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:55,551
LOOK.

1144
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,178
THIS IS A GAME OF NUMBERS, AND

1145
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,221
YOU KNOW SOMETHING, THEY HAVE

1146
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,890
ISOLATED THEMSELVES INTAS A

1147
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:01,724
GROUP OF TWOs.

1148
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,434
>> WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO RIGHT

1149
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:04,811
HERE IS THIS FOUR RIGHT HERE.

1150
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,687
I LOVE THIS FOUR.

1151
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,605
I'M A LEADER.

1152
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:08,856
I'M GOING TO BE THE LEADER NO

1153
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,106
MATTER.

1154
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,483
WHAT I'M THE TOM BRADY HERE.

1155
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:11,984
IF I STEP ON THE FIELD, ALL

1156
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,277
BUSINESS ASIDE, I'M TOM BRADY

1157
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,029
OUT HERE.

1158
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:16,447
THESE BROADS DON'T NO WHAT

1159
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,073
THEY'RE DOING.

1160
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,533
THEY CAME INTO THIS GAME WITH NO

1161
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:19,200
STRATEGY AT ALL.

1162
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,744
>> SO WHAT'S GOING ON IS ME,

1163
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,120
DAN, KELLY AND MIKE, WE'RE A

1164
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,455
STRONG FOUR.

1165
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,207
SO BYE-BYE, LINDSEY.

1166
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,917
ANYTHING YOU DO, YOU GOT TO BE A

1167
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,252
SMOOTH CRIMINAL LIKE MICHAEL

1168
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:32,296
JACKSON, BABY.

1169
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,340
LINDSEY IS SAYING SO MUCH

1170
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:35,341
DISRESPECTFUL STUFF AND I'VE

1171
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,218
BEEN HOLDING BACK.

1172
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,971
IF SHE WERE HOME I'D SPANK HER

1173
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,722
LIKE A BAD BABY.

1174
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,308
>> RODNEY SHOULD NOT BE SO

1175
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,476
FLAMBOYANT ABOUT LINDSEY GOING,

1176
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,603
HE COULD BE THE NEXT TO GO.

1177
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:48,646
IT'S FUNNY TO WATCH HIM.

1178
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:52,525
>> THE WINNER IS ON THE BLUE

1179
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:59,490
COLLAR.

1180
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,867
>> MIKE ANDRY DEFINITELY

1181
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,492
TOGETHER.

1182
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,411
AND MIKE DOES NOT TRUST RODNEY,

1183
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,371
AND I DON'T TRUST RODNEY EITHER.

1184
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,206
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

1185
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,583
>> IT'S YOU AND ME.

1186
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,876
I AGREE.

1187
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:10,376
>> OKAY.

1188
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:13,546
>> I DON'T TRUST HIM.

1189
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:16,299
>> HE PISSES ME OFF, LIKE BAD.

1190
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:29,520
>> I'M WITH YOU, 110.

1191
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,941
>> IT'S RODNEY.

1192
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:34,650
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1193
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:35,860
>> IT'S BEST FOR TRIBE.

1194
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:36,819
>> IT IS.

1195
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,988
HE'S MADE MISTAKES IN

1196
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:39,280
CHALLENGES.

1197
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,114
>> YEAH.

1198
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:41,532
NO, I KNOW.

1199
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:42,867
LINDSEY AND RODNEY CLASH.

1200
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,243
THEY BOTH HAVE ATTITUDES.

1201
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,245
THEY BOTH WANT TO BE THE BOSS.

1202
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,873
LINDSEY IS BITCHY HOW SHE'S

1203
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:55,296
GOING ABOUT IT.

1204
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,757
MIKE AND I ARE IN A GOOD

1205
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,799
POSITION TONIGHT TO GO WITH

1206
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,719
EITHER THE GIRLS OR THE GUYS.

1207
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,346
WE COULD VOTE FOR RODNEY OR WE

1208
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,640
COULD VOTE FOR LINDSEY.

1209
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,934
TONIGHT IS GOING TO BE HUGE.

1210
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:08,434
SOMEONE'S GOING HOME AND

1211
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,727
SOMEONE'S GOING TO BE PISSED

1212
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:21,822
OFF, BUT I KNOW IT'S NOT ME.

1213
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,035
>> Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS

1214
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:26,827
A TORCH.

1215
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:27,411
GO AHEAD AND GRAB A TORCH.

1216
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:32,166
DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.

1217
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,918
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF

1218
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:34,919
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS

1219
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,504
GAME FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE,

1220
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,506
AND WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO

1221
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,509
ARE YOU.

1222
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,178
ALL RIGHT, DAN, LET'S GET REAL.

1223
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:46,472
GIVE ME THE VIBE OF THIS TRIBE.

1224
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,057
WHO QUICKLY BONDED?

1225
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,433
>> LINDSEY AND SIERRA BONDED

1226
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,228
REALLY QUICKLY.

1227
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,688
>> Jeff: RODNEY, WHO DIDN'T

1228
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:57,149
GET ALONG?

1229
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,317
UM, THE ONE I DIDN'T GET ALONG

1230
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,610
WITH WITH IS THIS GIRL RIGHT

1231
00:37:59,694 --> 00:37:59,819
HERE.

1232
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,737
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT, WE

1233
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,073
DON'T MIX, WE'RE LIKE CHICKEN

1234
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,908
APARTMENT AND TUNA FISH.

1235
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,243
IT JUST DON'T TASTE GOOD.

1236
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,369
>> Jeff: SO LINDSEY, THIS

1237
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,037
THERE IS THIS WALL WITH RODNEY.

1238
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,039
>> RODNEY AND I JUST COME FROM

1239
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:12,540
VERY, VERY DIFFERENT

1240
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:12,832
BACKGROUNDS.

1241
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,458
WE HAVE VERY DIFFERENT MORALS.

1242
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,252
>> Jeff: SO IF RODNEY HAS

1243
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:17,336
DIFFERENT MORAL, IT WOULD IMPLY

1244
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,297
HE HAS NO MORALS.

1245
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,381
>> NONE.

1246
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:20,589
CORRECT.

1247
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,174
>> Jeff: SIERRA, HAVE YOU SEEN

1248
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,509
THAT SIDE OF RODNEY, AS WELL?

1249
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:24,760
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1250
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:27,513
I MEAN, JUST HIS VOCABULARY,

1251
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:30,141
IT'S VERY VULGAR, IT'S VERY

1252
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:30,474
DEMEANING.

1253
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,475
>> Jeff: WHAT'S DEMEANING?

1254
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,351
>> THE WAY HE TALKS ABOUT WOMEN,

1255
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,813
HOW HE TREATS WOMEN, I MEAN, IT

1256
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:36,313
GOES ON AND ON.

1257
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,565
I CAN SEE WHERE HE RUBS PEOPLE

1258
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:38,357
WRONG, YOU KNOW?

1259
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,443
>> Jeff: KELLY, WHAT'S YOUR

1260
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:41,652
TAKE ON RODNEY?

1261
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,946
>> AT FIRST I WAS A LITTLE UPSET

1262
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,322
WITH RODNEY, BUT YOU HAVE TO

1263
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,490
BITE YOUR TONGUE OUT HERE,

1264
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,742
THAT'S WAY HE COMES OUT AND

1265
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:48,534
WANTS TO PORTRAY HIMSELF, BUT I

1266
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,369
DO GET FRUSTRATED, LIKE SHUT UP,

1267
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,538
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR MOUTH.

1268
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:53,456
>> BUT IF YOU GO BACK TO WHERE

1269
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:56,208
I'M FROM, THE NUMBER-ONE LOVE OF

1270
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,793
MY LIFE, I DON'T HAVE A

1271
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:58,836
GIRLFRIEND, IT'S MY MOTHER.

1272
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,463
MY MOTHER WILL TELL YOU I'M THE

1273
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,964
BIGGEST SWEETHEART OUT THERE.

1274
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,549
I'M JUST STATING FACTS OF HOW

1275
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,342
WOMEN DISRESPECT THEMSELVES.

1276
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,470
THAT'S THE TYPE OF STUFF I DEAL

1277
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:07,887
WITH ALL THE TIME.

1278
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,889
I'VE GOT BURNED BY WOMEN.

1279
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:10,848
WOMEN SHOULD HOLD THEMSELVES TO

1280
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,600
A HIGHER STANDARD AND RESPECT

1281
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,269
THEMSELVES BECAUSE HE'S HOW MY

1282
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:17,229
MOTHER DID IT AND NOWADAYS GIRLS

1283
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:17,772
DON'T RESPECT THEMSELVES.

1284
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:18,481
>> Jeff: ARE YOU ABLE TO

1285
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:19,440
SEPARATE THEMSELVES AND SAY I

1286
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,484
KNOW THAT COMMENT JUST OFFENDED

1287
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,069
MILLIONS OF WOMEN?

1288
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:23,986
>> WHAT?

1289
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,530
THAT WOMEN SHOULD HOLD

1290
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:27,448
THEMSELVES AT A HIGHER RESPECT?

1291
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,658
>> Jeff: I GOT TO SAY, FOR

1292
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,619
WHAT IT'S WORTH, IT'S ULTIMATELY

1293
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:32,453
A SOCIAL GAME.

1294
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,996
YOU ARE AWARE THAT YOU'RE

1295
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,914
PLAYING WITH FIRE A LITTLE BIT

1296
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,332
WITH THAT KIND OF ALTITUDE,

1297
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:36,540
RIGHT?

1298
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,500
>> I KNOW IT COMES FROM MY HEAD,

1299
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,585
SO GUESS WHAT, I LOOK MY ENEMY

1300
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:43,297
IN THE EYE AND I'LL ATTACK BACK.

1301
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,091
>> Jeff: SO KELLY, YOU HAVE

1302
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,675
LINDSEY AND SIERRA THAT ARE

1303
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:47,593
PERCEIVED TO BE TIGHT, AND YOU

1304
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,595
HAVE RODNEY WHO IS ALSO HIS OWN

1305
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:51,055
LIGHTNING ROD.

1306
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,932
THEN YOU AND DAN AND MIKE, YOU

1307
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,850
HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT DO WE DO

1308
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,269
TONIGHT THAT IS GOOD FOR US AS A

1309
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:57,895
UNIT MOVING FORWARD IN THE GAME.

1310
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,522
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1311
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,565
LIKE SAYING WE VOTE FOR LINDSEY,

1312
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,567
SIERRA IS HER BEST FRIEND, SO

1313
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,568
YOU LOSE TWO PEOPLE.

1314
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,238
WE VOTE FOR SIERRA, WE LOSE TWO

1315
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,073
PEOPLE, IF WE VOTE FOR RODNEY

1316
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,200
TONIGHT, WE GAIN TRUST FOR OUR

1317
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:11,408
TRIBE.

1318
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,618
>> BUT LOOK AT US, I LOVE THIS

1319
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:15,538
TRIBE.

1320
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,957
I LOVE THIS TRIBE SINCE THE DAY

1321
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,499
THAT WE STEPPED ON OUR MATT.

1322
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,668
THIS TRIBE RIGHT HERE, WE WORK

1323
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,002
FOR EACH OTHER, WE FIGHT FOR

1324
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:22,503
EACH OTHER.

1325
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,004
WE LOVE TOGETHER.

1326
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,673
WE DO IT WITH DIRT ON OUR HAND,

1327
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,341
WITH BLOOD ON OUR HAND, WITH

1328
00:40:27,424 --> 00:40:27,883
SWEAT ROLLING DOWN OUR FACE,

1329
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,344
WITH TEARS IN OUR EYES, AND I'M

1330
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:32,054
TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW, WHETHER

1331
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,682
HE WALKS, I WALK, SHE WALKS, HE

1332
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,892
WALKS, SOMEONE ON THIS TRIBE ON

1333
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,435
THESE STOOLS RIGHT HERE IS GOING

1334
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,645
TO WIN $1 MILLION.

1335
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:44,400
BOTTOM LINE.

1336
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:45,442
>> Jeff: MIKE, DOES IT MAKE

1337
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,027
YOU SIT UP A LITTLE TALLER WHEN

1338
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:47,695
YOU HEAR LINDSEY, BECAUSE THAT

1339
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,572
SPEECH REALLY DOES ENCAPSULATE

1340
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:50,489
ONE THING, WE ARE ALL BLUE

1341
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,657
COLLAR, AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT

1342
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,908
THAT MEANS.

1343
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,536
>>LY GIVE LINDSEY 100% CREDIT.

1344
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,705
I THINK SHE UNIFIED US DAY ONE

1345
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,166
WHEN SHE SAID THE WINNER OF THIS

1346
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,168
GAME IS ON THIS TRIBE.

1347
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,086
IT SPARKED BIG DREAMS IN ALL OF

1348
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,046
OUR HEARTS, WHICH MADE US FIGHT

1349
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,173
FOR EACH OTHER.

1350
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,883
YOU KNOW, I DO LOVE THESE

1351
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:09,091
PEOPLE.

1352
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,051
IF I WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE

1353
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,136
NO-COLLAR TRIBE, I PROBABLY

1354
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,013
WOULD HAVE SLIT MY THROAT DAY

1355
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,139
ONE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1356
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,015
HONEST TO GOODNESS.

1357
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,892
AND THE WHITE-COLLAR TRIBE, THEY

1358
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,435
JUST LIVE OFF OF THE HARD WORK

1359
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,687
AND THE BACKS OF GOOD, SOLID,

1360
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,564
BLUE-COLLAR AMERICANS.

1361
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,316
BUT, YEAH, SO WE LOST A

1362
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,651
CHALLENGE TODAY, ONE OF US IS

1363
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,487
GOING HOME, SO I THINK WE FORMED

1364
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,947
BONDS REGARDLESS.

1365
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:36,327
FOR ME THAT'S MASSIVE.

1366
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,369
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

1367
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:41,624
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

1368
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:51,300
SIERRA, YOU'RE UP.

1369
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:13,405
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

1370
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:19,078
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY

1371
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:19,662
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

1372
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:26,585
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

1373
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,836
OKAY.

1374
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,296
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE

1375
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:29,922
DECISION IS FINAL, PERSON VOTED

1376
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,091
OUT WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE THE

1377
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,550
TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

1378
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:38,389
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1379
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:44,311
FIRST VOTE RODNEY.

1380
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,312
LINDSEY.

1381
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:49,441
RODNEY.

1382
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:49,692
LINDSEY.

1383
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:52,194
WE'RE TIED, TWO VOTES RODNEY,

1384
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:56,615
TWO VOTES LINDSEY.

1385
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,157
SIERRA.

1386
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,742
THAT'S TWO VOTES, LINDSEY, TWO

1387
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,120
VOTES RODNEY, ONE VOTE SIERRA.

1388
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:05,791
ONE VOTE LEFT.

1389
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,209
SIERRA.

1390
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:13,757
WE HAVE A THREE-WAY TIE.

1391
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,050
LINDSEY, RODNEY, SIERRA, YOU

1392
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:15,843
WILL NOT VOTE.

1393
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,554
MIKE, DAN, KELLY, YOU WILL VOTE,

1394
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:20,139
AND YOU CAN ONLY VOTE FOR ONE OF

1395
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:20,681
THOSE THREE.

1396
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:39,575
MIKE, YOU'LL COME GET THE URN.

1397
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:55,591
I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

1398
00:43:55,674 --> 00:44:01,430
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1399
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:08,771
FIRST VOTE LINDSEY.

1400
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:10,689
FOURTH PERSON VOTED OUT,

1401
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:10,898
LINDSEY.

1402
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,108
THAT'S TWO, THAT'S ENOUGH.

1403
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:25,913
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1404
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:30,793
LINDSEY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1405
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:43,847
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

1406
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,891
WELL, IT'S BEEN SAID MORE THAN

1407
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:47,017
ONCE THAT THE WINNER OF THIS

1408
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,644
GAME WILL COME FROM THIS TRIBE,

1409
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:50,729
AND THAT WILL REQUIRE TRIBAL

1410
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:51,397
UNITY.

1411
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,065
WE'LL SEE IF VOTING OUT THE

1412
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,608
PERSON WHO PREDICTED IT GIVES

1413
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:55,651
YOU THAT UNITY.

1414
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:56,944
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

1415
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:57,611
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

1416
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:57,945
GOOD NIGHT.

1417
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,613
>> WHEN YOU HAVE A PERSONALITY

1418
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:01,824
LIKE WHAT I HAVE, YOU ARE THE

1419
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,409
EPITOME OF PLAY WITH FIRE, YOU

1420
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:04,451
MIGHT GET BURNED.

1421
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,494
SOMETIMES OTHER PEOPLE GET THE

1422
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:06,662
BURN, SOMETIMES I GET THE BURN

1423
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:07,204
MYSELF.

1424
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:08,163
I'M WALKING OFF THIS ISLAND

1425
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,249
BECAUSE I HURT A MAN'S EGO.

1426
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:11,792
I'M NOT GOING TO APOLOGIZE, NOT

1427
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,043
TO MYSELF, NOT TO ANYBODY ELSE,

1428
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:13,919
NOT TODAY, NOT TOMORROW, NOT

1429
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:15,254
EVER.

1430
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:15,838
I WOULD STAND BY EVERY CHOICE

1431
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:20,134
THAT I MADE AND I WOULD DO IT

1432
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:28,058
AGAIN.

1433
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,231
>> YOU VOTED FOR ME.

1434
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:35,524
>> DOESN'T MATTER WHO IT WAS.

1435
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,151
>> I MEAN, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.

1436
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,153
>> THE REASON YOUR NAME GOT

1437
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,487
WRITTEN DOWN IS BECAUSE IF THERE

1438
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,823
WAS AN IDOL IN PLAY, IT WASN'T

1439
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:43,949
GOING TO BE ONE OF THESE FOUR

1440
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,868
THAT WENT HOME.

1441
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:47,453
THAT'S NICE AND TO THE POINT AS

1442
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:51,206
I CAN POSSIBLY BE.

1443
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,000
TRIBAL WENT EXACTLY AS OUR

1444
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:53,375
ALLIANCE PLANNED.

1445
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:54,960
I'M 100% HAPPY WITH THE DECISION

1446
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,628
WE MADE TONIGHT.

1447
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:59,381
I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT SIERRA BEING

1448
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,757
CUT OFF AND ALIENATED FROM THE

1449
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:00,966
TRIBE.

1450
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,009
>> SIERRA, WE DO WANT THERE TO

1451
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:05,053
BE UNITY BACK IN THIS TRIBE

1452
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,139
AGAIN, AND WE CAN'T DO THAT

1453
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,057
UNLESS WE AIR THE GRIEVANCES,

1454
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,601
GET 'EM OUT IN THE OPEN AND THEN

1455
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:12,019
WE CAN BE DONE WITH THEM.

1456
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:12,936
THE FIRST PUZZLE CHALLENGE, YOU

1457
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,688
COULDN'T DO IT.

1458
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:15,022
YOU STEPPED OUT.

1459
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,191
THE SECOND CHALLENGE IN THE

1460
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,442
WATER, YOU NEARLY KILLED MIKE

1461
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:21,153
AND I BECAUSE YOU MISSED SO MANY

1462
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:21,695
SHOTS.

1463
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:23,614
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I DON'T

1464
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:24,490
LIKE YOU.

1465
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,533
WE ALL LOOK AT YOU AS AN ASSET.

1466
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,785
>> IT'S REALLY HARD TO HEAR THAT

1467
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,329
LITTLE BIT THAT I'M AN ASSET

1468
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:33,499
WHEN YOU SAY REPEATEDLY

1469
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:34,458
NUMBERING OUT THINGS I DID

1470
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:34,833
WRONG.

1471
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,085
NOT ONLY DID I JUST LOSE MY

1472
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,837
CLOSEST ALLIANCE, BUT TO COME

1473
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:42,591
BACK AND GET ATTACKED FOR THE

1474
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:44,384
PLAYER THAT I AM, THAT'S TOUGH.

1475
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,720
AT THIS POINT, I CAN'T TRUST

1476
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:48,180
THESE PEOPLE.

1477
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:50,182
I BUSTED MY ASS FOR YOU GUYS

1478
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:53,560
AROUND CAMP, IN THE CHALLENGES.

1479
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:53,977
>> WHAT ABOUT ME?

1480
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,021
MY NAME GOT WRITTEN DOWN.

1481
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,731
>> SOMEBODY'S GOING TO COME OUT

1482
00:46:57,814 --> 00:47:02,569
AND BLIND SIDE ME, I GOT NO

1483
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,196
SORROW FOR TEARS COMING DOWN

1484
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,948
YOUR EYE, NOT FROM A GUY LIKE ME

1485
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,450
AND HOW I GREW UP.

1486
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,118
SIERRA'S OUT THERE CRYING.

1487
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,370
GUESS WHAT, I DON'T CARE.

1488
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:12,496
YOU WROTE MY DOWN.

1489
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:13,664

ABSOLUTELY DEAD TO ME.

1524
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:49,301
DEAD.

EVERYBODY WILL TAKE A BUFF.

00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,786
ESCAMECA ONE POINT AWAY FROM A

1674
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:27,662
BIG REWARD.

1675
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,247
NAGAROTE TRYING TO PLAY DEFENSE

1676
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,790
OUT THERE AND MAKE SURE NOBODY

1677
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,876
ON THE BLUE SIDE SCORES.

1678
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:34,544
HERE WE GO.

LAUNCH.

1681
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:46,264
BOTH BALLS IN THE AIR.

1682
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:49,184
WILL SCORES, BUT IT WILL NOT

1683
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:50,268
MATTER, MIKE SCORES FOR

00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:56,483
>> GOOD JOB, GUYS.

1688
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,234
GOOD JOB, GUYS.

1689
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:02,447
GOOD JOB, GUYS.

1690
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:04,824
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, ESCAMECA,

1691
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:05,825
NICE REWARD.

1692
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:06,910
COME GET IT.

00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:07,452
ENJOY YOUR AFTERNOON.

BE WAITING FOR YOU BACK AT CAMP.

1698
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,751
ALL RIGHT.

NAGAROTE, GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.

00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:17,462
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO

1701
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:17,671
CAMP.

1702
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:20,298
>> WHEN WE GOT THE WORD WE WERE

1703
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,092
SWITCHING TEAMS, I WAS SO

1704
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:25,887
EXCITED, AND I OPENED IT UP, AND

1705
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:30,892
I'M WITH MAX AND SHIRIN.

1706
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,144
WHAT, ARE THE SURVIVOR GODS

1707
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,605
TRYING TO KILL ME?

1708
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:57,544
>> GREAT JOB, GUYS.

1709
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:00,422
[ALL SPEAKING AT ONCE]

1710
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:02,465
>> SO WE'VE GOT THREE NO

1711
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,925
COLLARS, THREE WHITE COLLARS AND

1712
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,927
ONE BLUE COLLAR, KELLY.

1713
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,470
SO IMMEDIATELY I'M LIKE, WE GOT

1714
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,639
TO GET KELLY ON OUR SIDE, BUT I

1715
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:10,473
WANTED THINGS TO BE SLOW AND

1716
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:11,558
FEEL PEOPLE OUT, BECAUSE OUR

1717
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,269
CAMP IS SO LAID BACK, OUR NO

1718
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:15,937
COLLAR CAMP, WE CAN SIT BACK AND

1719
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,313
WATCH, AND OUR PLAN JUST COMES

1720
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:18,940
TO US.

1721
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,358
>> JUST F.Y.I., WE USUALLY DO

1722
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:23,319
BEANS IN THE MORNING AND RICE AT

1723
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:24,904
NIGHT.

1724
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,032
>> SHIRIN IS AN AMAZING SURVIVOR

1725
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:27,240
COACH.

1726
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:28,742
>> WELCOME TO THE KITCHEN.

1727
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,285
>> THERE ARE TWO THINGS WE DO

1728
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:32,078
WITH THE COCONUT, I DON'T KNOW

1729
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,413
HOW BIG OF FANS YOU RUSSIA BUT

1730
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,165
THAT'S HELPED ME BE A COOK.

1731
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,958
>> I KNOW THIS GAME REALLY WELL,

1732
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,418
NOT JUST HISTORICAL FACTS BUT

1733
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:38,835
STRATEGY.

1734
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:40,712
WE HAVE THREE NO COLLAR, THREE

1735
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:41,838
WHITE COLLAR AND ONE BLUE

1736
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:42,088
COLLAR.

1737
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,591
I'M IN ONE OF THE POWER TRIOS,

1738
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,301
SO THE SIMPLEST ROUTE IS TO

1739
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:47,594
STICK WITH WHITE COLLAR AND PULL

1740
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:54,642
OVER THE BLUE COLLAR.

1741
00:55:54,726 --> 00:56:00,482
>> I KEEP SAYING IT, BUT I'M SO

1742
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:04,194
GLAD THAT YOU'RE HERE, HALI,

1743
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:04,527
CAROLYN.

1744
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:05,653
>> STILL ON YOUR TRIBE.

1745
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:06,404
>> THEY WERE LIKE THE ONLY COOL

1746
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,615
PEOPLE ON MY TRIBE.

1747
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:10,658
>> I AM AN UNDERCOVER COP.

1748
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:11,951
THIS IS LIKE GOING INTO A HOUSE

1749
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:14,996
THE BUY DRUGS FROM PEOPLE YOU

1750
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:15,997
TOTALLY DON'T EVEN KNOW.

1751
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:16,831
YOU HAVE TO START TALKING.

1752
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:18,291
YOU HAVE TO BUILD THEIR TRUST.

1753
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:19,667
YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO WAIT

1754
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:21,836
BECAUSE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT,

1755
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,671
BUT THIS ISN'T AS BAD AS I

1756
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:24,339
THOUGHT.

1757
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:25,799
MAYBE I'M IN A GOOD POSITION

1758
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,425
BECAUSE I'M THE SWING VOTE.

1759
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:30,637
>> YOU AND MAX, I JUST FELT,

1760
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,305
YEAH, THIS IS AWESOME.

1761
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:33,515
AND CAROLYN, TOO.

1762
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:34,974
>> WE WANT THE PLAY WITH YOU.

1763
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:35,433
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1764
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,018
I'M DEFINITELY IN.

1765
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:39,395
>> I TALKED TO KELLY, THREW HER

1766
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,439
A LITTLE BAIT.

1767
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:43,566
SHE BIT AND THEN WE JUST

1768
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:44,984
SOLIDIFIED SOMETHING.

1769
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,570
IT WAS VERY WINK, WINK, HUSH,

1770
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:50,240
HUSH, WE'LL TALK MORE LATER, BUT

1771
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:59,999
YES.

1772
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,417
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME

1773
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:02,669
TO CAMP ESCAMECA.

1774
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:05,839
>> THIS LOOKS LIKE THE

1775
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,090
RITZ-CARLTON COMPARED TO WHERE

1776
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:07,423
WE WERE.

1777
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:08,466
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

1778
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:09,467
>> OH, YEAH.

1779
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:10,468
THE NEW ESSEC BASICALLY FOUR

1780
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,137
BLUE COLLARS.

1781
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,764
>> JOAQUIN, NICE THE MEET OWE,

1782
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:14,931
BRO.

1783
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:17,559
>> TWO WHITE COLLAR AND ONE NO

1784
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:18,309
COLLAR.

1785
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:20,645
>> WE'VE GOT THE MAJORITY, SO

1786
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:21,813
THE NUMBERS COULDN'T HAVE WORKED

1787
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:22,522
OUT BETTER IN OUR FAVOR.

1788
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:26,151
>> NO IDEA AFTER LAST NIGHT'S

1789
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:29,863
VOTE, BUT WITH DAN AND RODNEY

1790
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:30,572
CUTTING INTO SIERRA LAST NIGHT,

1791
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:36,619
IT DEFINITELY CAUSES CONCERN.

1792
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:40,415
THESE THREE GUYS COULD WOO

1793
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:40,832
SIERRA OVER.

1794
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:42,333
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SURE

1795
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,543
SHE DOESN'T GET TOO CLOSE TO

1796
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:44,669
SOMEBODY AND GET SWAYED OVER TO

1797
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:45,587
THE OTHER SIDE.

1798
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,547
>> MY MOTHER IS 64, BUT IF YOU

1799
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,425
SEE HER, YOU'D MAYBE HIT ON HER.

1800
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:50,967
THAT'S HOW GOOD SHE LOOKS.

1801
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,385
SHE LOOKS YOUNG.

1802
00:57:52,468 --> 00:57:54,304
>> ROB, WHAT ARE THE TATTOOS?

1803
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:58,850
>> THIS ONE SAYS, EVEN THOUGH

1804
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,435
I'LL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN, YOU'LL

1805
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:00,935
ALWAYS BE MY BIG SISTER.

1806
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:03,146
TWO YEARS AGO I CAME HOME AND

1807
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:04,355
FOUND MY SISTER DEAD.

1808
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:05,773
IT WAS CRAZY, PROBABLY THE WORST

1809
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:06,858
THING THAT EVER HAPPENED IN MY

1810
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:07,525
LIFE.

1811
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,736
>> RODNEY'S GONE THROUGH A LOT

1812
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,614
OF STRUGGLES, BUT MIND'S

1813
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:12,906
STRAIGHT.

1814
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:13,698
LIKE A BUNCH OF MY FRIENDS BACK

1815
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:15,867
HOME, I'LL FEEL HIM OUT, TRY

1816
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:18,036
LEARN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND

1817
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:18,661
WORK THEM LIKE I'VE BEEN WORKING

1818
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:19,746
EVERYBODY ON MY LAST TRIBE.

1819
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:22,373
>> SOMEBODY WANT TO GO WITH ME

1820
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:23,082
TO GRAB WATER?

1821
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:27,795
>> YEP.

1822
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:30,215
>> ARE ALL MY TRIBE MATES GONE?

1823
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:30,590
>> YEAH.

1824
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,342
>> I'M SO GRATEFUL YOU GUYS ARE

1825
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:32,550
HERE.

1826
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:32,926
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

1827
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:35,053
LIKE THE SECOND I THREW MY BUFF

1828
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:35,678
ON THE GROUND, I WAS SO EXCITED

1829
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:37,805
TO GET AWAY FROM THOSE PEOPLE

1830
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,098
AND I HAPPEN TO GET STUCK WITH

1831
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:43,102
THREE OF THEM AGAIN.

1832
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,646
>> GLORY, GLORY, I'M LATCHING ON

1833
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:46,606
THE ANYTHING I CAN GRAB ON TO

1834
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:47,732
BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE SUCK AND

1835
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:50,985
TREAT ME LIKE DIRT.

1836
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:52,570
>> SIERRA SEEMS TO BE KIND OF

1837
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,280
THE BROKEN PUPPY.

1838
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:54,989
THESE THINGS ARE GOOD.

1839
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,991
AS I'VE ALWAYS SAID, BRING ME

1840
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:59,410
YOUR POOR, YOUR TIRED, YOUR

1841
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:00,411
HUDDLED SURVIVORS.

1842
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,497
LIKE I WANT THE BROKEN PEOPLE TO

1843
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,915
COME WITH ME AND BE ON MY TRIBE.

1844
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:06,125
>> THOSE PEOPLE WERE SO MEAN TO

1845
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,168
ME.

1846
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,503
>> I MARTIN SEEMUNGAL TALKING

1847
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:10,338
WITH THE THREE GUYS, WHICH MAKES

1848
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:11,923
ME A LITTLE NERVOUS BECAUSE IF

1849
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:17,929
JOE, JOAQUIN AND TYLER CAN GET

1850
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,472
SIERRA, THEN IT'S ME AND DAN AND

1851
00:59:19,555 --> 00:59:19,973
ROD NISM WE NEED HER AS A

1852
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:20,932
NUMBER.

1853
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:22,809

HAPPEN, RIGHT?

1874
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:15,153
>> SHE HASN'T STOPPED TALKING

1875
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:16,070
SINCE WE GOT HERE.

1876
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,322
IT'S DRIVING ME INSANE.

01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:44,265
WAY, NOT ONCE, BUT TWICE.

1885
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:46,100
SO I HOBBLED IN OFF THE BEACH,

1886
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:48,853
I'VE GOT BLOOD POWRLG OUT OF MY

1887

>> FORTUNATELY FOR ME, WE HAVE A

1892
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:57,904
FORMER LIFEGUARD ON THE TRIBE,

JENN IMMEDIATELY SPRUNG INTO

1894
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:00,490
ACTION.

1895
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:02,367
SHE TOOK A POT OF BOILING WATER

1896
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:04,160
THAT WAS MEANT FOR DRINKING,

1897
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:05,745
PULLED IT FROM THE FIRE AND

1898
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,289
SAID, PUT YOUR FEET IN THERE AND

1899
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:12,627

>> "SURVIVOR" IS NO JOKE.

1905
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,554
SITTING THERE WITH MY FEET IN

1906
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:25,473
SCALDING WATER, I SUDDENLY

1907
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:28,601
FORGOT I HAD THAT ROBBING ANIMAL

1908
01:01:28,684 --> 01:01:29,977
INFLICTED WOUNDS BECAUSE MY FEET

1909
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:31,646
WERE ON FIRE FROM THE BOILING

1910
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:33,981
WATER THEY WERE SITTING IN.

1911
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:34,732
>> WHAT'S ON THE BOSTON UM OF

1912
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,317
YOUR FOOT?

1913
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:38,778
IS THAT A PLANTAR'S...

1914
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:39,153
>> YES.

1915
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,739
>> SO MAX STICKS BOTH OF HIS

1916
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,533
FEET IN OUR DRINKING WATER POT.

1917
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:45,326
IT'S BEEN LIKE AN HOUR THEY'RE

1918
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:45,952
SOAKING.

1919
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,995
THEN HE LIFTS HIS FOOT UP.

1920
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:51,666
HE HAS A PLANTAR'S WART THE SIDE

1921
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:52,583
OF A QUARTER IN OUR DRINKING

1922
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:53,251
WATER.

1923
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:56,462
I'M LIKE, MAX, WARTS ARE

1924
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:57,130
CONTAGIOUS, THAT'S DISGUSTING.

1925
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,257
>> WE HAVE TO BOIL MORE WATER.

1926
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:02,593
>> ANYONE WHO WOULD STICK THEIR

1927
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:04,762
WARTY FEET IN THE TRIBE'S

1928
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:08,057
DRINKING WATER FOR HOURS WHEN

1929
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:09,475
WE'RE THIRSTY HAS HIS MIND ON

1930
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,227
ONE PERSON, HIMSELF, AND HIS

1931
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:11,853
STINGRAY FEET.

1932
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:17,775
IT WAS DISGUSTING.

1933
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:20,153
>> HE'S BEEN ON MY NERVES.

1934
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:22,280
>> MAX AND SHIRIN ARE SO

1935
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:22,530
ANNOYING.

1936
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:26,117
AND THEY MAY THINK IT'S 3-3, NO

1937
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,245
COLLAR AGAINST WHITE COLLAR, NOT

1938
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:29,912
HAPPENING.

1939
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:33,332
SO I'M THINKING, ALL RIGHT,

1940
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,126
CAROLYN, PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE,

1941
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:38,629
DON'T GO CRAZY, BUT TO BLINDSIDE

1942
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,007
THEM WOULD BE SO SWEET.

1943
01:02:41,090 --> 01:03:04,280
YOU JUST CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.

1944
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:04,906
>> WHAT I'M WORRIED RIGHT NOW IS

1945
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:09,160
SIERRA IS NOW A SWING VOTE.

1946
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:09,952
>> THAT'S WHAT I TRIED TO TELL

1947
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:11,787
YOU GUYS.

1948
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,247
LAW OFF OF HER A LITTLE BIT, BUT

1949
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:15,374
YOU AND RODNEY HAD TO JUST DIG

1950
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,710
INTO HER INSTEAD OF TAKING THE

1951
01:03:17,793 --> 01:03:19,962
OPPORTUNITY OF REELING HER BACK

1952
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:22,215
IN, YOU ALREADY HAD IT SET IN

1953
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:23,132
YOUR MIND THAT SHE WAS GONE.

1954
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:25,426
>> WE HAD TO HAVE SIERRA'S VOTE,

1955
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:25,927
RIGHT OR WRONG?

1956
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,011
>> WE HAVE TO HAVE SIERRA'S

1957
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:28,471
LOYALTY.

1958
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:29,639
IF YOU DON'T HAVE HER LOYALTY,

1959
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:31,349
YOU DON'T HAVE HER VOTE.

1960
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:33,392
>> DAN, JUST LISTEN TO WHAT I'M

1961
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:34,060
TELLING YOU.

1962
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,853
SHUT YOUR MOUTH, APOLOGIZE AND

1963
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,313
LET'S MOVE FORWARD.

1964
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:37,980
>> TIME TO PLAY NICE, DAN.

1965
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:39,899
>> OKAY.

1966
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:42,401
I'LL TAKE SIERRA OFF, ASK HER IF

1967
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:43,986
SHE'S WILLING TO GO FOR A WALK

1968
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,489
WITH ME AND SAY, LISTEN, I WAS

1969
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:47,615
UPSET AND I'M SORRY.

1970
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:49,367
I DID NOT TRY TO TELL YOU THAT I

1971
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:50,284
DIDN'T THINK YOU PULLED YOUR

1972
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:50,535
WEIGHT.

1973
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:53,955
>> DON'T EVEN DO NONE OF THAT.

1974
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:55,206
>> I'M SORRY.

1975
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:56,332
I JUST WANT TO APOLOGIZE.

1976
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,084
>> THE ONLY THING SHE WOULD LOVE

1977
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,710
TO HEAR IN MY PERSONAL

1978
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:00,670
EXPERIENCE WITH WOMEN, THEY

1979
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:01,295
DON'T WANT THE EXPLANATION, THEY

1980
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:04,590
JUST WANT TO HEAR YOU SAY

1981
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:05,591
THEY'RE SORRY SO THEY CAN BE

1982
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:05,758
RIGHT.

1983
01:04:05,841 --> 01:04:07,802
>> DUDE, YOU'RE HALF MY AGE.

1984
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:08,010
OKAY.

1985
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:11,347
I HAVE TALKED TO SO MANY MORE

1986
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:14,267
GIRLS THAN YOU HAVE, IT'S SILLY.

1987
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,561
DUDE, DUDE, I GOT SIERRA.

1988
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:20,898
I GOT THIS.

1989
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:23,526
>> CAN WE PLEASE TALK IT OUT?

1990
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:25,736
>> BUT, OF COURSE, I COME BACK

1991
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:27,905
AND HAVE TO SIT AT THE FIRE AND

1992
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:28,990
GET ATTACKED.

1993
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:29,907
YOU JUST PICKED THE WRONG TIME.

1994
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:31,951
>> I DON'T DISAGREE, AND I OWN,

1995
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:34,370
THAT BUT WHAT HURT ME WAS YOU

1996
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:35,037
ATTACKED ME, AND THAT WAS OKAY.

1997
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,414
>> NO.

1998
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:38,165
>> BUT WHEN I GAVE IT BACK TO

1999
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:38,708
YOU, IT'S NOT.

2000
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:40,209
>> IT WAS THE WRONG PLACE AND

2001
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:40,585
THE WRONG TIME.

2002
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:44,463
>> I'M SEEING WHAT WE DID,

2003
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,048
ABSOLUTELY, EXACTLY THE SAME

2004
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,050
THINGS, BUT FOR SOME REASON YOU

2005
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,303
TAKE YOURS AS MORE OF A SLIGHT

2006
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:51,846
THAN MINE, AND I DON'T

2007
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:52,346
UNDERSTAND WHY.

2008
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:57,143
>> IT'S NOT THE SAME.

2009
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:58,352
YOU COME BACK FROM TRIBAL AND

2010
01:04:58,436 --> 01:04:59,562
YOUR NAME HAS BEEN WRITTEN DOWN

2011
01:04:59,645 --> 01:04:59,770
TWICE.

2012
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:01,606
>> I'M ALL EXCITED TO GO INTO A

2013
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:02,064
CHALLENGE TO HELP.

2014
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:03,566
>> IT'S NOT GOING TO GET

2015
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:03,816
ANYWHERE.

2016
01:05:03,899 --> 01:05:05,359
IF YOU'RE SORRY, YOU DON'T GO

2017
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:06,110
INTO AN APOLOGY SAYING, I'M

2018
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:09,405
SORRY THAT I MADE YOU FEEL THAT

2019
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:09,989
WAY, BUT YOU DID IT TO ME,

2020
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:11,157
THAT'S WHY.

2021
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,158
>> I'M NOT TRYING TO BELITTLE

2022
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,744
IT, BUT WE BOTH SAID SOME PRETTY

2023
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:15,745
NOT NICE THINGS TO EACH OTHER.

2024
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:18,956
>> IT WAS<i> THE</i> CRAPPIEST APOLOGY

2025
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,416
I'VE EVER RECEIVED ON MY LIFE.

2026
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:22,126
>> WE CAN TURN ON EACH OTHER OR

2027
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:22,668
LOOK EACH OTHER IN THE EYE.

2028
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,670
>> CAN WE JUST KEEP WALKING.

2029
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,088
>> I HAVE TWO SEPARATE ALLIANCES

2030
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:28,507
COMING AT ME SAYING, WE NEED YOU

2031
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:29,383
AS OUR FOURTH.

2032
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:32,011

01:11:47,302 --> 01:11:47,803
NEVER GIVE UP.

2216
01:11:47,886 --> 01:11:51,015
>> I'M VERY EXCITED TO GET ON

2217
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:52,558
WITH THE GAME "SURVIVOR."

2218
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:54,935
THE BLIND SIDES, THE DOUBLE

2219
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:55,561
CROSSING, THAT'S REALLY WHAT I

2220
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:58,480
SIGNED ON FOR.

2221
01:11:58,564 --> 01:11:59,898
AND FINALLY I'M GOING TO HAVE

2222
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:01,525
ANOTHER CHANCE TO GET TO DO IT

2223
01:12:01,608 --> 01:12:04,820
TONIGHT.

2224
01:12:04,903 --> 01:12:06,363
>> BEFORE WE LEFT I WENT THROUGH

2225
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:10,200
ALL OF THE "SURVIVOR" WINNERS, I

2226
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:11,577
THINK CAPRICORNS WON "SURVIVOR"

2227
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:15,289
THE MOST.

2228
01:12:15,372 --> 01:12:15,998
>> REALLY?

2229
01:12:16,081 --> 01:12:17,499
>> THEN AFTER THIS THERE WERE A

2230
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:18,083
COUPLE LEOS.

2231
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:18,542
>> COOL.

2232
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:18,751
THANKS.

2233
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:20,335
BYE.

2234
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:21,795
I'VE SEEN EVERY SEASON OF

2235
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:22,087
"SURVIVOR."

2236
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:23,630
I'M A HUGE FAN OF THE GAME, BUT

2237
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:25,299
MAX KNOWS EVERY LITTLE DETAIL

2238
01:12:25,382 --> 01:12:25,883
ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT'S EVER

2239
01:12:25,966 --> 01:12:27,885
HAPPENED ON "SURVIVOR."

2240
01:12:27,968 --> 01:12:28,927
IT'S CRAZY.

2241
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,512
LIKE WHY DO YOU KNOW THIS MUCH?

2242
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:33,390
WHY DO YOU REMEMBER LIKE

2243
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:34,767
LITTLE... IT'S LIKE PEOPLE THAT

2244
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:36,769
REMEMBER LIKE THE '96 BULLS GAME

2245
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:38,937
AGAINST THE HEAT ON LIKE OCTOBER

2246
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:42,483
13th OR WHENEVER BASKETBALL

2247
01:12:42,566 --> 01:12:43,942
HAPPENS.

2248
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:45,527
>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING FOR

2249
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:45,778
TONIGHT?

2250
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:47,404
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT I LIKE MAX

2251
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:48,906
OR SHIRIN.

2252
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:51,075
I DON'T KNOW IF THE THREE YELLOW

2253
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:52,034
WILL STAY TOGETHER AND WE NEED

2254
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:52,618
TO GRAB KELLY OR WHAT WE'RE

2255
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:54,453
GOING TO DO RIGHT NOW.

2256
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:56,080
>> I MEAN, I LIKE KELLY.

2257
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:57,790
>> I LIKE KELLY, TOO.

2258
01:12:57,873 --> 01:13:00,626
IT'S JUST MATTER OF IF SHE WANTS

2259
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:02,377
TO GO WITH US.

2260
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:03,921
>> WILL'S GOING TO STAY WITH US?

2261
01:13:04,004 --> 01:13:04,463
>> OBVIOUSLY.

2262
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:07,508
>> WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.

2263
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:08,759
WE NEED TO START THINKING ABOUT

2264
01:13:08,842 --> 01:13:09,176
WHAT WE WANT TO DO.

2265
01:13:09,259 --> 01:13:10,761
>> TRIBAL TONIGHT, IT WILL COME

2266
01:13:10,844 --> 01:13:12,221
DOWN TO KELLY BECAUSE SHE'S A

2267
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:13,472
SWING VOTE.

2268
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:14,765
BETWEEN NO COLLAR AND WHITE

2269
01:13:14,848 --> 01:13:15,891
COLLAR.

2270
01:13:15,974 --> 01:13:17,101
SO KELLY BEING THE SWING VOTE IS

2271
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:19,228
IN THE POWER POSITION.

2272
01:13:19,311 --> 01:13:21,438
WHAT IF WE JUST GET A MAJORITY

2273
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:22,606
APART FROM THEM TWO, VOTE OFF

2274
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:25,150
SHIRIN AND THEN TAKE MAX IN

2275
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:26,527
BECAUSE WE NEED HIM FOR

2276
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:26,819
CHALLENGES?

2277
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:29,071
>> I LIKE THAT.

2278
01:13:29,154 --> 01:13:29,363
I LIKE THAT.

2279
01:13:29,446 --> 01:13:30,948
>> OKAY.

2280
01:13:31,031 --> 01:13:34,076
>> OKAY.

2281
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:35,619
SO FROM MY POINT OF VIEW,

2282
01:13:35,702 --> 01:13:37,329
THERE'S IN WAY WE'RE GOING TO

2283
01:13:37,412 --> 01:13:37,913
WIN ANY CHALLENGES BETWEEN NOW

2284
01:13:37,996 --> 01:13:42,000
AND THE MERGE.

2285
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:44,420
>> THE ONLY THING IS THIS, I

2286
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:49,133
THINK WE NEED TO BLIND SIDE...

2287
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:51,009
>> WE CAME INTO THE MIX UP WITH

2288
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:54,555
A CLASSIC "SURVIVOR" SPLIT.

2289
01:13:54,638 --> 01:13:56,515
THREE NO COLLARS, THREE WHITE

2290
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:58,225
COLLARS AND KELLY FROM THE BLUE

2291
01:13:58,308 --> 01:13:59,726
COLLAR TRIBE IN THE MIDDLE.

2292
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:00,602
WHITE COLLAR WAS MOST AGGRESSIVE

2293
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:02,479
ABOUT PURSUING KELLY AT THAT

2294
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:04,606
CRUCIAL SWING VOTE.

2295
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,150
SHIRIN WAS DOING A LOT OF HARD

2296
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:07,484
WORK UP FRONT.

2297
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:09,570
AND I FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT

2298
01:14:09,653 --> 01:14:11,738
WE'RE ABLE TO SECURE HER.

2299
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:13,532
>> OKAY.

2300
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:13,824
YOU GOT IT.

2301
01:14:13,907 --> 01:14:14,575
SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

2302
01:14:14,658 --> 01:14:16,410
>> WE'RE GOOD.

2303
01:14:16,493 --> 01:14:18,453
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE'VE

2304
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:20,372
GOT ALL THE BRAINS OVER HERE,

2305
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,040
WE'VE GOT SKINNY GIRLS WHICH ARE

2306
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:23,584
GREAT FOR SO MANY CHALLENGES.

2307
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:24,585
WE'VE GOT GREAT SWIMMERS OVER

2308
01:14:24,668 --> 01:14:25,836
HERE.

2309
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:27,421
WILL CAN'T DO ANY OF THOSE

2310
01:14:27,504 --> 01:14:27,963
THINGS.

2311
01:14:28,046 --> 01:14:30,007
AND I THINK WITHOUT HIM, WE

2312
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:31,425
ACTUALLY HAVE A REALLY STRONG

2313
01:14:31,508 --> 01:14:32,092
CHANCE OF WINNING.

2314
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:34,720
>> BY THE WAY, JUST BRILLIANT,

2315
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:36,096
THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO SAY TO

2316
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:36,263
YOU.

2317
01:14:36,346 --> 01:14:40,642
>> YEAH, YEAH.

2318
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:42,603
>> I'M PRETTY SURE I'M IN THE

2319
01:14:42,686 --> 01:14:43,395
POWER SEAT TONIGHT.

2320
01:14:43,478 --> 01:14:45,314
I'M PRETTY SURE I'M THE ONE THAT

2321
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:46,273
ORCHESTRATED EVERYTHING THAT IS

2322
01:14:46,356 --> 01:14:46,648
GOING DOWN.

2323
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:48,984
I'M THE ONE WHO DECIDED IT'S

2324
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:49,818
GOING TO BE WILL.

2325
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:52,070
DOES IT IMPACT ME ALL THAT MUCH?

2326
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:57,117
NOT REALLY.

2327
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:58,827
>> KELLY WAS THERE AMPS WE

2328
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:01,205
HASHED IT OUT WITH HER.

2329
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:02,539
>> WHAT'S THE PLAN?

2330
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:06,460
>> GET RID OF HER?

2331
01:15:06,543 --> 01:15:07,586
>> ON PAPER KELLY LOOKS LIKE THE

2332
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:10,589
SWING VOTE, AND MAX AND SHIRIN

2333
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:12,591
THINK I'M 100% IN WITH THEM, BUT

2334
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:13,675
I'M A SWING VOTE.

2335
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:15,886
I CAN TAKE THAT POWER AWAY FROM

2336
01:15:15,969 --> 01:15:17,512
KELLY AND BE FOUR STRONG WITH

2337
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:19,848
THE NO COLLARS AND WE'RE GOOD TO

2338
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:20,724
GO.

2339
01:15:20,807 --> 01:15:22,559
SO I THINK A FABULOUS BLIND SIDE

2340
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:30,692
MAY BE IN THE MAKING.

2341
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:33,820
>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

2342
01:15:33,904 --> 01:15:34,112
ANYTHING?

2343
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:36,782
>> I'M KIND OF OBVIOUSLY NOT

2344
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:38,033
LIKE MY PEOPLE.

2345
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:39,743
BUT WE'VE GOT US THREE AND

2346
01:15:39,826 --> 01:15:41,370
THREE.

2347
01:15:41,453 --> 01:15:42,079
KELLY'S THE ONE.

2348
01:15:42,162 --> 01:15:43,997
I DON'T KNOW HOW CLOSE YOU ARE

2349
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:44,706
WITH THEM.

2350
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:48,335
>> I'M IN THE A PART OF THAT

2351
01:15:48,418 --> 01:15:51,672
THREE.

2352
01:15:51,755 --> 01:15:56,969
>> I WILL TELL YOU, THEY TELL

2353
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:57,594
YOU I'M PART OF THE THREE.

2354
01:15:57,678 --> 01:16:05,769
IF YOU GUYS ARE IN, I'M 150% NOT

2355
01:16:05,852 --> 01:16:07,354
EVEN WITH THEM.

2356
01:16:07,437 --> 01:16:09,189
>> THAT MAKES OUR LIFE SO MUCH

2357
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:09,439
EASIER.

2358
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:11,108
>> I'M EXCITED BECAUSE IT SOUNDS

2359
01:16:11,191 --> 01:16:12,276
LIKE EVERYONE HATES MOST OF THE

2360
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:12,818
WHITE COLLARS.

2361
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:13,986
NO ONE CAN STAND MAX.

2362
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:15,737
NO ONE CAN STAND SHIRIN.

2363
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:18,073
AND WE HAVE CAROLYN.

2364
01:16:18,156 --> 01:16:19,491
SO WE HAVE THE NUMBERS.

2365
01:16:19,574 --> 01:16:19,992
WE'LL CONTROL THE GAME.

2366
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:22,995
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE WITH US.

2367
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:30,752
>> SO GOOD TO KNOW.

2368
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:32,963
>> CAROLYN, SHE SAID GREAT.

2369
01:16:33,046 --> 01:16:35,215
>> I JUST DON'T WANT TO AVOID

2370
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:37,718
ANY SORT OF POTENTIAL UNEXPECTED

2371
01:16:37,801 --> 01:16:38,802
EVENTS TONIGHT.

2372
01:16:38,885 --> 01:16:40,762
>> WHY DID THEY LET US KNOW THEY

2373
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:42,764
KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT "SURVIVOR,"

2374
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:47,269
MAX AND SHIRIN?

2375
01:16:47,352 --> 01:16:48,437
I DON'T THINK SHE'S STOPPED

2376
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:49,521
TALKING SINCE WE GOT HERE.

2377
01:16:49,604 --> 01:16:50,856
>> SHE WILL NEVER VOTE OUT MAX.

2378
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:52,858
THEY'RE LIKE THIS.

2379
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:55,861
>> SO DO YOU FEEL TOTALLY ON THE

2380
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:56,820
OUTS WITH THEM?

2381
01:16:56,903 --> 01:16:57,863
>> TOTALLY.

2382
01:16:57,946 --> 01:16:58,238
THEY'RE SCHEMING.

2383
01:16:58,322 --> 01:17:00,574
>> I SAY GET RID OF THEM TWO.

2384
01:17:00,657 --> 01:17:01,867
>> THE NO-COLLAR TRIBE, THEY'RE

2385
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:02,784
TIGHT.

2386
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:05,579
CAROLYN'S IN THE TIGHT WITH WITH

2387
01:17:05,662 --> 01:17:05,996
THE WHITE COLLAR.

2388
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:07,456
SO IT WOULDN'T BENEFIT ME TO

2389
01:17:07,539 --> 01:17:07,998
STAY WITH SHIRIN AND MAX.

2390
01:17:08,081 --> 01:17:10,417
>> LET'S DECIDE WHO WE'RE GOING

2391
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:16,089
TO GO FOR RIGHT NOW.

2392
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:20,844
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WE NEED

2393
01:17:20,927 --> 01:17:22,929
MAX IN CHALLENGES.

2394
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:23,764
BUT SHIRIN TALKS SO MUCH.

2395
01:17:23,847 --> 01:17:25,807
>> THE DEBATE TONIGHT IS BETWEEN

2396
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:28,810
MAX AND SHIRIN, WHO IS THE MOST

2397
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:29,353
ANNOYING.

2398
01:17:29,436 --> 01:17:30,729
I THINK IT'S ABOUT NECK AND

2399
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:32,647
NECK, BECAUSE NEITHER ONE OF

2400
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:33,732
THEM WILL SHUT UP AND THEY WON'T

2401
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:37,569
STOP STRATEGIZING.

2402
01:17:37,652 --> 01:17:38,820
THEY WILL JUST GO OFF BY THE

2403
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:39,905
FIRE AND LEAVE US AND JUST

2404
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:42,699
STRATEGIZE, STRATEGIZE,

2405
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:42,991
STRATEGIZE.

2406
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:44,701
>> I JUST DON'T KNOW WHETHER

2407
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:46,912
THEY COULD BE OVER THERE

2408
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:48,955
SCHEMING ABOUT SOMETHING.

2409
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:49,790
>> IT'S LIKE WHO IS MORE

2410
01:17:49,873 --> 01:17:52,876
ANNOYING.

2411
01:17:52,959 --> 01:17:53,251
I CAN'T DECIDE.

2412
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:55,837
WHO IS MORE ANNOYING?

2413
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:57,464
MAX OR SHIRIN?

2414
01:17:57,547 --> 01:18:00,634
IT'S EXACTLY LIKE A HORSE RACE?

2415
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:03,804
NO, HERE COMES MAX WITH HIS FOOT

2416
01:18:03,887 --> 01:18:05,514
WART.

2417
01:18:05,597 --> 01:18:06,973
NO, HERE'S SHIRIN.

2418
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:08,141
NO, HERE'S MAX AGAIN, WHO'S

2419
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:10,394
GOING TO GET VOTED OUT TONIGHT.

2420
01:18:10,477 --> 01:18:11,686
WHO'S MOST ANNOYING?

2421
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:12,062
I DON'T KNOW.

2422
01:18:12,145 --> 01:18:12,938
WE'LL SEE.

2423
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:15,816
WE'LL FIND OUT TONIGHT AT

2424
01:18:15,899 --> 01:18:23,073
TRIBAL.

2425
01:18:36,294 --> 01:18:36,545
>> Jeff: OKAY.

2426
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:38,004
SO AFTER THE SWITCH WE END UP

2427
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:39,464
WITH THREE WHITE COLLARS, THREE

2428
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,758
NO COLLARS AND KELLY FROM THE

2429
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:43,677
BLUE COLLAR TRIBE.

2430
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,429
SHIRIN, WHAT DID YOU NOTICE WHEN

2431
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:46,012
ALL SEVEN PEOPLE GOT TOGETHER?

2432
01:18:46,096 --> 01:18:47,806
>> FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, IT FELT

2433
01:18:47,889 --> 01:18:50,642
LIKE A BRAND-NEW HOME TO ME.

2434
01:18:50,725 --> 01:18:52,519
WE ALL GELLED REALLY QUICKLY IN

2435
01:18:52,602 --> 01:18:55,981
A WAY THAT WHITE COLLAR NEVER

2436
01:18:56,064 --> 01:19:00,026
DID, AND... YOU'RE MAKING A

2437
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:00,235
FACE.

2438
01:19:00,318 --> 01:19:00,569
>> Jeff: I AM?

2439
01:19:00,652 --> 01:19:01,903
>> YES.

2440
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:07,742
LIKE I'M DELUSIONAL.

2441
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:08,034
NO.

2442
01:19:08,118 --> 01:19:08,243
OKAY.

2443
01:19:08,326 --> 01:19:08,869
SORRY.

2444
01:19:08,952 --> 01:19:09,286
>> Jeff: HOLD ON.

2445
01:19:09,369 --> 01:19:10,996
LET ME CHECK MYSELF, BECAUSE

2446
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:12,873
MAYBE THE BOTOX ISN'T WORKING.

2447
01:19:12,956 --> 01:19:13,790
IT SEEMS WEIRD THAT I WOULD MAKE

2448
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:16,376
A REACTION TO YOU SAYING IT

2449
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:17,502
FEELS LIKE A NEW HOME.

2450
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:18,837
THAT SEEMS LIKE AN ORDINARY

2451
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:19,421
COMMENT TO MAKE.

2452
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:20,881
>> YOU JUST LOOK REALLY INTENSE.

2453
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:22,716
>> Jeff: OKAY.

2454
01:19:22,799 --> 01:19:23,467
WELL, THAT'S JUST ME.

2455
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:23,842
>> OKAY.

2456
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:26,052
>> Jeff: KELLY, DID YOU FEEL

2457
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:26,970
THE SAME UNITY EVEN THOUGH

2458
01:19:27,053 --> 01:19:29,931
YOU'RE FROM THREE DIFFERENT

2459
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:30,182
TRIBES?

2460
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:31,433
>> THERE'S BEEN A FEW THINGS

2461
01:19:31,516 --> 01:19:32,058
THAT HAVE GONE DOWN AT THE TRIBE

2462
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:33,894
THAT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE

2463
01:19:33,977 --> 01:19:34,227
UNCOMFORTABLE.

2464
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:36,146
>> Jeff: LIKE WHAT?

2465
01:19:36,229 --> 01:19:38,815
>> UM...

2466
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:42,319
>> Jeff: WHY IS THAT FUNNY?

2467
01:19:42,402 --> 01:19:44,029
>> BECAUSE YOU'RE HITTING AT

2468
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:44,654
SOMETHING THAT'S EMERGING FROM

2469
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:47,240
THE UNIQUE SITUATION WE FIND

2470
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:48,492
OURSELVES IN, THAT ON PAPERER

2471
01:19:48,575 --> 01:19:51,369
THIS TRIBE IS A DISASTER.

2472
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:53,705
IT'S LIKE THE SWAMP FOR

2473
01:19:53,788 --> 01:19:54,164
"SURVIVOR" ONE WORLD.

2474
01:19:54,247 --> 01:19:56,082
YOU HAD ONE TIME THAT SEEMED TO

2475
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:58,793
GET EVERY TALL, ATHLETIC FIT

2476
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:01,171
PERSON, AND THE OTHER ENDED UP

2477
01:20:01,254 --> 01:20:05,008
WITH COLTON AND TARZAN AND THEY

2478
01:20:05,091 --> 01:20:07,511
SELF-IDENTIFIED AS MISFITS.

2479
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:10,055
IF WE'RE GIVING YOU AN

2480
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:12,182
INAUTHENTIC COUPLE BUY YAW,

2481
01:20:12,265 --> 01:20:14,893
WE'RE TRYING THE TRICK OURSELVES

2482
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:19,189
INTO THINKING WE HAVE CHANCE.

2483
01:20:19,272 --> 01:20:19,439
[LAUGHTER]

2484
01:20:19,523 --> 01:20:20,023
>> Jeff: WHY ARE YOU LAUGH,

2485
01:20:20,106 --> 01:20:20,232
JENN?

2486
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:23,026
>> I'M LAUGHING AT HIS KNOWLEDGE

2487
01:20:23,109 --> 01:20:24,236
FROM EVERY SINGLE SEASON.

2488
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:24,903
I'M LIKE, HOW DO YOU REMEMBER

2489
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:26,279
THAT?

2490
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:26,947
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

2491
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:28,740
WHY DO YOU KNOW THAT?

2492
01:20:28,823 --> 01:20:31,993
>> I HAVE A HARD TIME

2493
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:32,577
REMEMBERING EVERYONE'S HERE

2494
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:32,744
NAME.

2495
01:20:32,827 --> 01:20:34,496
>> GUILTY AS CHARGED.

2496
01:20:34,579 --> 01:20:35,914
I KNOW IT'S NOT NECESSARILY

2497
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:36,498
HEALTHY.

2498
01:20:36,581 --> 01:20:37,958
THERE'S SOMETHING IN MY D.N.A.

2499
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:39,000
I DON'T KNOW MY MOM'S CELL PHONE

2500
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:41,002
NUMBER, BUT I DO KNOW WHAT

2501
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:43,088
HAPPENED AT THE SWAP IN "ONE

2502
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:44,172
WORLD."

2503
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:45,006
THAT'S WHAT SPEED DIAL IS FOR,

2504
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:46,049
RIGHT?

2505
01:20:46,132 --> 01:20:47,425
>> Jeff: SHIRIN, YOU WEAR THIS

2506
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:49,135
LOVE OF THE GAME AS A BADGE OF

2507
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:50,387
HONOR, NOT SOMETHING TO BE

2508
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:50,762
EMBARRASSED ABOUT.

2509
01:20:50,845 --> 01:20:52,931
>> YEAH, "SURVIVOR" HAS ALWAYS

2510
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:54,808
BEEN MY LIFE DREAM, SO I HAVE A

2511
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:56,518
LOT OF RESPECT FOR THIS GAME AND

2512
01:20:56,601 --> 01:20:57,894
I'M SOUPING EVERYBODY PREACH

2513
01:20:57,978 --> 01:21:00,689
YAILTS MY SUPER FANDOM, BUT I

2514
01:21:00,772 --> 01:21:01,898
THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT I'M A

2515
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:04,067
LITTLE BIT OF AN OVERTHINKING

2516
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:04,442
OBSESSIVE TYPE.

2517
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:06,027
>> Jeff: MAX, CAN YOU RELATE

2518
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:06,695
TO THAT?

2519
01:21:06,778 --> 01:21:07,737
>> CERTAINLY.

2520
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:09,072
LISTEN, I KNOW IT'S NOT

2521
01:21:09,155 --> 01:21:09,781
NECESSARILY HEALTHY.

2522
01:21:09,864 --> 01:21:11,157
I KNOW IT'S THE SORT OF THING

2523
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:13,326
THAT LANDS A LOT OF TYPE A

2524
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:13,952
PERSONALITIES IN THE HOSPITAL

2525
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:16,454
WITH A CORONARY AT AGE 47, AND I

2526
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:18,582
CERTAINLY HOPE THAT THROUGH MY

2527
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:20,000
MANDATORY RELAXATION I CAN AVOID

2528
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:21,751
THAT SORT OF FATE.

2529
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:23,086
>> Jeff: WAIT.

2530
01:21:23,169 --> 01:21:25,046
MANDATORY RELAXATION?

2531
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:26,840
>> I HAVE TO MAKE MYSELF RELAX

2532
01:21:26,923 --> 01:21:27,299
OR ELSE I JUST WON'T.

2533
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:29,134
>> Jeff: WILL, DO YOU PICK UP

2534
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:29,801
ON THAT?

2535
01:21:29,884 --> 01:21:30,844
>> ABSOLUTELY.

2536
01:21:30,927 --> 01:21:31,928
AND THAT FRUSTRATES ME IN THE

2537
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:33,430
CAMP.

2538
01:21:33,513 --> 01:21:34,889
YOU GOT SHIRIN AND MAX GOING OFF

2539
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:40,145
TO THE FIRE AND JUST TALK,

2540
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:40,937
JUST... I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE

2541
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:42,188
STRATEGIZING.

2542
01:21:42,272 --> 01:21:43,773
THEY DO THAT CONSTANTLY EVERY

2543
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:44,399
SINGLE DAY.

2544
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:45,692
>> Jeff: HALI, LET'S TALK

2545
01:21:45,775 --> 01:21:46,860
ABOUT THE VOTE, BECAUSE YOU

2546
01:21:46,943 --> 01:21:48,361
CAN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT

2547
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:49,696
YOU'RE OUTMATCHED PHYSICALLY BY

2548
01:21:49,779 --> 01:21:50,071
THE OTHER TRIBE.

2549
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:52,282
SO WHAT DO YOU BASE THE VOTE ON?

2550
01:21:52,365 --> 01:21:54,451
>> THERE ARE STRATEGIC VOTES

2551
01:21:54,534 --> 01:21:55,452
THAT COULD HAPPEN.

2552
01:21:55,535 --> 01:21:56,578
THERE'S LOYALTY VOTES THAT COULD

2553
01:21:56,661 --> 01:21:56,828
HAPPEN.

2554
01:21:56,911 --> 01:21:58,496
AND THERE'S QUALITY OF LIFE

2555
01:21:58,580 --> 01:21:59,122
VOTES THAT COULD HAPPEN.

2556
01:21:59,205 --> 01:22:01,625
AND AFTER TONIGHT'S VOTE, I

2557
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:02,167
THINK THAT IT WILL BE A MUCH

2558
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:04,336
MORE PLEASANT CAMP LIFE FOR ALL

2559
01:22:04,419 --> 01:22:05,545
OF US.

2560
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:06,129
>> Jeff: WILL, DO YOU THINK

2561
01:22:06,212 --> 01:22:09,215
IT'S GOING TO BE A BLIND SIDE

2562
01:22:09,299 --> 01:22:09,466
TONIGHT?

2563
01:22:09,549 --> 01:22:10,759
>> UM, YEAH.

2564
01:22:10,842 --> 01:22:11,051
I DO.

2565
01:22:11,134 --> 01:22:13,720
>> Jeff: SHIRIN, FEEL RIGHT TO

2566
01:22:13,803 --> 01:22:14,846
YOU THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A

2567
01:22:14,929 --> 01:22:15,889
BLIND SIDE, AS WELL?

2568
01:22:15,972 --> 01:22:17,474
>> YEAH, I DO THINK IT'S A BLIND

2569
01:22:17,557 --> 01:22:17,766
SIDE.

2570
01:22:17,849 --> 01:22:19,142
COULD BE ME AND THEN IT'S

2571
01:22:19,225 --> 01:22:21,978
DEFINITELY A BLIND SIDE, BUT,

2572
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:22,979
YEAH, I THINK THERE ARE SOME

2573
01:22:23,063 --> 01:22:24,856
ADVANTAGES TO A BLIND SIDE THAT

2574
01:22:24,939 --> 01:22:27,067
HELP KEEP TEAM UNITY.

2575
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:29,778
TYPICALLY YOU'RE BLIND SIDING

2576
01:22:29,861 --> 01:22:31,946
SOMEBODY BECAUSE THERE IS SOME

2577
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:33,156
UNPLEASANTNESS OR SOMEONE IS NOT

2578
01:22:33,239 --> 01:22:34,908
