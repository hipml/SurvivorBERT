1
00:00:01,292 --> 00:00:06,881
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," AT THE HERO TRIBE,

2
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:09,092
CHRISSY WAS RUNNING THE SHOW
WITH BEN.

3
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,886
>> WE'RE IN THE PRIME POSITION.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,431
>> Jeff: WHILE ASHLEY AND ALAN
WERE BUTTING HEADS.

5
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:15,306
>> ARE WE STRONG OR NOT?

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,975
>> DUDE, YOU ARE TRIPPING.

7
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:21,896
>> Jeff: AT THE HEALER TRIBE,
JESSICA AND COLE WERE LOVING

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,814
LIFE AND SHARING SECRETS.

9
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:25,275
>> JOE HAS THE IDOL.

10
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:29,612
>> Jeff: AT THE HUSTLER TRIBE,
PATRICK AND LAUREN WENT AFTER

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,655
EACH OTHER.

12
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,283
>> I'M ASSUMING YOU'LL TRY TO
VOTE ME OUT TONIGHT.

13
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:36,953
>> Jeff: AND AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL, PATRICK LOST THE

14
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:37,746
BATTLE.

15
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,499
PATRICK, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

16
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,459
15 ARE LEFT.

17
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:51,217
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

18
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:16,951
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

19
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,996
HEROES AND HEALERS GETTING YOUR
FIRST LOOK AT THE NEW HUSTLER

20
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:20,997
TRIBE.

21
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,835
PATRICK VOTED OUT AT THE LAST
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

22
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:26,503
ALL RIGHT.

23
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,172
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO IT?

24
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,006
>> YES.

25
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,341
>> Jeff: EVERYBODY, DROP YOUR
BUFFS.

26
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,301
>> WOW.

27
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:36,012
>> Jeff: WE'RE SWITCHING
TRIBES.

28
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,472
>> WOW.

29
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,474
>> OH, MY GOD.

30
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:43,353
>> Jeff: I'M GOING TO HAND YOU
BUFFS.

31
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:48,858
>> IT'S DAY NINE, AND WE WERE
ALL STARTING TO GET A LITTLE BIT

32
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:52,403
COMFORTABLE, BUT WHEN JEFF SAYS,
"DROP YOUR BUFF," ALL OF THAT

33
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,364
GETS ERASED, AND IT'S A
BRAND-NEW GAME.

34
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,406
>> DREW: ALL RIGHT.

35
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,325
SHALL WE?

36
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,410
EVERYBODY REVEAL.

37
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:04,999
ONCE YOU FIND YOUR COLOR, TAKE A
SPOT ON THE MAT.

38
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,919
BRING YOU STUFF WITH YOU AND SAY
HELLO TO YOUR NEW TRIBE MATES.

39
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,504
>> OH, MY GOD.

40
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:10,713
BYE, GUYS.

41
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,092
>> I INSTANTLY LOOKED OVER AT
COLE AND SAW THAT I HAD A RED

42
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,344
BUFF AND HE HAD A RED BUFF, TOO.

43
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:19,556
MY PALMS WERE SWEATING, MY HEART
WAS RACING.

44
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,056
IT WAS AWESOME.

45
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:21,349
>> WELCOME, RYAN.

46
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,101
>> Jeff: WOW.

47
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:23,852
BIG MIX-UP.

48
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,270
LET'S START WITH OUR FIRST
TRIBE.

49
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:30,316
WE HAVE TWO HEROES TOGETHER WITH
ASHLEY AND ALAN, TWO HEALERS

50
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,448
WITHYDESI AND JOE, AND ONE
HUSTLER WITH DEVON.

51
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,285
DESI, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS
NEW TRIBE?

52
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:44,080
>> LOOKING AROUND, I DON'T THINK
WE FARED TOO BADLY.

53
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:46,416
THE SWAPPED WORKED OUT REALLY
WELL FOR ME.

54
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:50,420
WE HAVE THREE OF THE STRONGEST
MEN, AND ASHLEY I KNOW IS A

55
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,170
SUPER STRONG SWIMMER.

56
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,965
I THINK WE'RE IN A GREAT
SITUATION.

57
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:58,761
PHYSICALLY I DON'T THINK THERE'S
A REASON WE COULDN'T DOMINATE.

58
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,307
>> Jeff: OKAY, NEXT GROUP, WE
HAVE TWO HUSTLERS WITH RYAN AND

59
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:08,146
ALI, TWO HEROES, CHRISSY AND
J.P., ROARK, YOU'RE THE ODD

60
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,606
PERSON OUT ON THIS TRIBE.

61
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,899
CONCERNS OR IS THAT A
OPPORTUNITY?

62
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,734
>> I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY
BOTH.

63
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:13,776
I JUST DON'T KNOW.

64
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,615
I'M EXCITED TO INTRODUCE THESE
PEOPLE TO THE BEACH.

65
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,617
I HOPE WE CAN ALL BE FRIENDS.

66
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,328
>> Jeff: GO TO OUR LAST TRIBE.

67
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:27,665
WE HAVE THREE HEALERS WITH
JESSICA, DR. MIKE, AND COLE, ONE

68
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,877
HUSTLER WITH LAUREN, ONE HERO
WITH BEN.

69
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,088
BEN, WHAT DOES THIS FEEL LIKE,
BECAUSE YOU WERE ON A DOMINANT

70
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,298
TRIBE DOING VERY WELL.

71
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,508
NOW YOU'RE A LONE SOLDIER OUT
HERE WITH A GROUP OF NEW PEOPLE.

72
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,344
>> YES, SIR.

73
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:44,098
IT LOOKS PRETTY BAD FOR ME, AND
WHAT WAS YOU NAME AGAIN?

74
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,433
>> LAUREN.

75
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:46,976
>> LAUREN.

76
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,478
WE WALKED OVER HERE.

77
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:48,978
OPEN ARMS.

78
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:49,646
THEY GAVE US ALL HUGS.

79
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,813
I THINK WE'LL DO ALL RIGHT.

80
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:55,777
>> BEING SPLIT UP FROM CHRISSY,
THAT'S A SHOT IN THE FOOT.

81
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,321
THINGS WERE WELL-OILED AND
GREASED AND WE WERE MOVING.

82
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,616
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO PUT SOME
WORK INCH I'M NOT JUST GOING TO

83
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:04,953
ROLL OVER AND DIE, BUT MY ODDS
AT THIS POINT ARE REAL LOW TO

84
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:05,787
MOVE FORWARD.

85
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:11,542
I'M SCARED.

86
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:16,547
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

87
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,632
WE HAVE THREE NEW TRIBES.

88
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,509
THE BIG QUESTION IS HOW WELL
WILL YOU WORK TOGETHER?

89
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:23,054
WHY NOT RIGHT NOW FOR YOUR FIRST
REWARD CHALLENGE.

90
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:23,596
ARE YOU READY?

91
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,722
>> LET'S DO IT, JEFF.

92
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,058
>> Jeff: FOR TODAY'S
CHALLENGE, THREE MEMBERS OF EACH

93
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,977
TRIBE WILL BE ATTACHED TO A
BRAIDED ROPE.

94
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,854
ON MY GO YOU'LL WORK TOGETHER TO
UNTANGLE THAT ROPE.

95
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,481
ONCE YOU'RE COMPLETELY
SEPARATED, YOU'LL USE THE ROPE

96
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:38,361
TO HOOK A SLED AND PULL IT BACK
TO YOU WHERE THE TWO REMAINING

97
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,613
TRIBE MEMBERS WILL USE THE
PIECES ON TOP TO SOLVE AN

98
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:44,534
UPRIGHT PUZZLE.

99
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,744
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR?

100
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:47,620
>> YES.

101
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,872
>> Jeff: PEANUT BUTTER AND
JELLY BANANA.

102
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,374
>> I KNEW IT!

103
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,376
I KNEW IT!

104
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,213
[APPLAUSE]
>> Jeff: PEANUT BUTTER AND

105
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:59,882
JELLY SANDWICHES TO EAT RIGHT
AWAY, AND ENOUGH PEANUT BUTTER,

106
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,177
JELLY, AND BREAD TO MAKE
SANDWICHES FOR A WHILE, PLUS AN

107
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,847
INDIVIDUAL BACK OF POTATO CHIPS
FOR EACH PLAYER.

108
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,226
ONE MORE THING, THIS IS A
WINNER-TAKE-ALL CHALLENGE.

109
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,354
NO SECOND PLACE.

110
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,689
TAKE A MINUTE TO STRATEGIZE.

111
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:19,277
WE'LL GET STARTED.

112
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:19,902
ALL RIGHT.

113
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:20,737
HERE WE GO.

114
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,366
FIRST REWARD CHALLENGE AS A NEW
TRIBE.

115
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,451
SURVIVORS READY?

116
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,578
GO!

117
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,579
>> LET'S GO, GUYS.

118
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:33,708
>> Jeff: LOTS OF NEW GROUPS.

119
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:37,587
WE HAVE ALAN AND ASHLEY WHO HAVE
WORKED TOGETHER BUT DON'T KNOW

120
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,421
JOE.

121
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,465
FOR SOKO WE HAVE RYAN, ROARK,
AND J.P.

122
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:44,302
NOBODY KNOWS ANYBODY.

123
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:47,430
AND WE HAVE COLE, BEN, AND
LAUREN, WHERE NOBODY KNOWS

124
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,598
ANYBODY.

125
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,768
SO THE FIRST STAGE OF THIS
CHALLENGE IS GOING TO COME DOWN

126
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:59,233
TO HOW WELL GROUPS OF STRANGERS
CAN LEARN TO COMMUNICATE VERY

127
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,611
FAST.

128
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:01,986
>> ME OVER YOU?

129
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,946
>> STEP OVER.

130
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:04,655
>> NOPE, NOPE, NOPE, NOPE.

131
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,784
>> Jeff: LOTS OF TALK WITH
SOKO.

132
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,993
>> OKAY, OKAY.

133
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:12,789
>> Jeff: BEN, LAUREN, AND COLE
ARE MOVING FASTER BY THE SECOND.

134
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,124
THEY'VE REALLY GOT A RHYTHM
GOING.

135
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,753
NOW YOU GOT TO GET OVER AND
UNDER.

136
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,839
NOW THE YOW OO TRIBE IN RED IN
THE EARLY LEAD.

137
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,591
>> GUYS, YOU'RE AHEAD.

138
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:27,345
>> Jeff: THE SOKO TRIBE IN
YELLOW TRYING TO CATCH UP.

139
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,137
THEY'RE FREE.

140
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,514
NOW YOU HAVE TO GET OVER AND
UNDER.

141
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,975
JOE, ALAN, AND ASHLEY STRUGGLE.

142
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,644
>> POP OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE,
JOE.

143
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,521
>> ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

144
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,648
>> Jeff: ROARK LAUNCHES
HERSELF OVER.

145
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:39,816
BEN THROWS HIMSELF OVER.

146
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,110
EVERYBODY GETTING PHYSICAL NOW
ON "SURVIVOR."

147
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:46,239
>> GOOD JOB, GOOD JOB, ONE MORE
FLIP.

148
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,825
>> Jeff: MOVING ON TO THE
THIRD AND FINAL SECTION.

149
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,536
SOKO IS MOVING ON TO THIS THIRD
PHASE OF THE UNTANGLING.

150
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:56,249
IT IS STILL YOWA IN THE LEAD.

151
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,377
J.P., ROARK, AND RYAN DOING A
GREAT JOB OF WORKING TOGETHER,

152
00:06:59,460 --> 00:06:59,961
SLOWLY CATCHING YOWA.

153
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,629
>> YOU'RE ALMOST THERE.

154
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:02,839
>> YOU'RE ALMOST THERE.

155
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,048
COME ON!

156
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,802
>> Jeff: AND ONCE AGAIN ALAN,
ASHLEY, AND JOE STRUGGLE TO GET

157
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:08,177
A RHYTHM.

158
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,011
>> ALL RIGHT.

159
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,972
YOU GOT TO MOVE A LITTLE BIT
FASTER.

160
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:15,309
>> Jeff: IT'S J.P. AND BEN
SIDE BY SIDE TRYING TO GET OVER

161
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,478
THAT LAST BIT OF ROPE.

162
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,689
J.P. LAUNCHING HIMSELF.

163
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:23,568
GO ONE PERSON.

164
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:24,527
SOKO NOW IN THE LEAD.

165
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,696
NOW YOU'RE TRYING TO HOOK THAT
SLED.

166
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,698
BEN IS OVER NOW.

167
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,574
RED CAN GO.

168
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,783
YOU DID ALL THIS WORK TO
UNTANGLE THE ROPE.

169
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:34,537
NOW YOU'RE GOING TO USE IT TO
BRING THOSE PIECES TO THE TWO

170
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,581
REMAINING TRIBE MEMBERS.

171
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,709
ALAN, JOE, AND ASHLEY ARE
EXHAUSTED.

172
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,919
NOTHING EASY ABOUT THIS
CHALLENGE.

173
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:45,047
ALL TANGLED UP WITH THE ROPE
NOW.

174
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:53,764
ALL THAT EFFORT AND WE ARE NOW
BACK TO EVEN.

175
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,434
YOWA LASSOS IT.

176
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:57,852
THEY ARE BACK IN THE LEAD NOW.

177
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:02,523
THIS IS HEAVY, AND IT'S TAKING
THREE PEOPLE A LOT OF EFFORT.

178
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,107
YOU'RE GOOD.

179
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,735
TAKE OVER, PUZZLE SOLVERS.

180
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:09,405
JESSICA AND DR. MIKE WORKING ON
THAT PUZZLE WHILE J.P. CONTINUES

181
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:13,075
THE TRY THE HOOK THE SLED FOR
SOKO.

182
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,161
ALAN NOW IN FOR LEVU.

183
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:19,415
IT IS AN UPRIGHT PUZZLE, NOT
EASY TO SOLVE.

184
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:21,751
JESSICA AND DR. MIKE HAVE BEEN
TOGETHER IN THIS GAME FROM DAY

185
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:22,835
ONE.

186
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,088
IT WOULD SAME THEY WOULD HAVE AN
ADVANTAGE IN TERMS OF

187
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,715
COMMUNICATING.

188
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,759
>> FOCUS ON THE END.

189
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,636
>> Jeff: J.P. LAUNCHES AND HE
HAS IT.

190
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,429
YOU GOT TO PULL.

191
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:34,555
IT IS HEAVY.

192
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,057
>> TOGETHER.

193
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,769
ON THREE, ONE, TWO, THREE!

194
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,229
>> Jeff: RYAN GIVING
EVERYTHING HE.

195
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,231
CAN IT REQUIRES ALL THEIR
MUSCLE.

196
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,107
>> ONE, TWO, THREE, PULL!

197
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,275
>> Jeff: YOU'RE GOOD.

198
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:46,776
GO, PUZZLE SOLVERS.

199
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,944
YOU GUYS ARE DONE.

200
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:51,989
IT'S NOW CHRISSY AND ALI QUICKLY
TRYING TO MAKE UP GROUND.

201
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,449
ALAN NOW FEELING THE PRESSURE.

202
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,743
THEY HAVE NO SHOT WITHOUT THOSE
PUZZLE PIECES.

203
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:56,786
CAN'T GET IT TO HOOK.

204
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:00,539
JESSICA AND DR. MIKE HAVE A BIG
TIME ADVANTAGE.

205
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,917
BUT CHRISSY AND ALI ARE NOT
MESSING AROUND.

206
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,961
THEY DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER, BUT
THEY'RE WORKING TOGETHER

207
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:05,795
QUICKLY.

208
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,756
>> MOVE THIS, MOVE THIS, AND
MOVE THIS.

209
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,800
>> Jeff: YOWA CONTINUES TO
MOVE FORWARD.

210
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,093
>> I'M GETTING IT.

211
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,095
>> Jeff: ALAN FALLS SHORT
AGAIN.

212
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,721
IS THIS A SIGN OF THE NEW LEVU
TRIBE?

213
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,474
>> DO YOU WANT SOMEBODY ELSE TO
TRY?

214
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:20,351
>> LET ME GET ONE MORE.

215
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,604
>> Jeff: JESSICA AND DR. MIKE
CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS AS

216
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:24,814
MIKE SMASHES JESSICA'S FINGERS.

217
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:25,982
>> I'M SORRY.

218
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:30,987
>> Jeff: IT WOULD BE A HUGE
COMEBACK FOR SOKO IF THEY COULD

219
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:31,862
PULL THIS OUT.

220
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,823
DR. MIKE AND JESSICA ARGUING.

221
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,826
ALI AND CHRISSY ARE WORKING
TOGETHER TRYING TO CLOSE THAT

222
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,160
GAP.

223
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,829
>> THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT.

224
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,998
>> Jeff: DR. MIKE MAKES A
CHANGE.

225
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,833
>> WE HAVE IT.

226
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,127
>> Jeff: JESSICA MAKES ANOTHER
CHANGE.

227
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,169
IS THIS RIGHT?

228
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,338
THIS WOULD BE A HUGE REWARD,
BIGGEST OF THE SEASON.

229
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:54,176
THEY THINK THEY HAVE IT, AND
THEY DO!

230
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,012
YOWA WINS REWARD!

231
00:09:56,095 --> 00:10:09,650
PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY BONANZA.

232
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,194
YOWA, CONGRATULATION, NICE WAY
TO WELCOME IN A NEW TRIBE.

233
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,362
BIG REWARD.

234
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,866
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, ENJOY THE AFTERNOON.

235
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,536
>> OH, MY GOSH.

236
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,662
>> Jeff: SOKO, LEVU, GOT
NOTHING FOR YOU.

237
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,830
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP, SPEND THE AFTERNOON

238
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,040
GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

239
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,752
>> NOW THAT THE HEROES AND THE
HEALERS AND THE HUSTLERS ARE ALL

240
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,920
SWITCHED UP, THE GAME HAS
STEPPED UP A LEVEL.

241
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,674
YOU HAVE TO PERFORM.

242
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:53,361
>> NICE.

243
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,487
>> THIS IS AWESOME.

244
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,615
>> FIRST INITIAL IMPRESSION OF
THIS TRIBE SWAP, THERE'S A

245
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,784
LITTLE BIT OF COMFORT IN OUR
TRIBE KNOWING THAT WE WORK WELL

246
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:04,747
TOGETHER AND WON THAT PB&J.

247
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:11,879
BUT THREE HEALERS, ONE HUSTLER,
AND A HERO, THAT'S TARGET PINNED

248
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,255
RIGHT ON MY TAIL.

249
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,259
SO I HAVE TO EARN RESPECT AROUND
HERE AND GAIN TRUST TO KEEP MY

250
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,930
BUTT IN THE GAME.

251
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,934
>> OBVIOUSLY US THREE KNOW EACH
OTHER PRETTY WELL.

252
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:25,935
MY NAME IS COLE.

253
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:26,894
I'M FROM ARKANSAS ORIGINALLY.

254
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,647
BUT I'VE BEEN LIVING IN WYOMING.

255
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,733
>> THE WHOLE TRIBE IS GETTING TO
KNOW EACH OTHER.

256
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,904
I LOOK IN MY CHIP BAG AND I SEE
TO MY SURPRISE THE WORD "SECRET

257
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:37,488
ADVANTAGE."

258
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,030
IT LOOKED LIKE A BIG CHIP.

259
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,324
I ALMOST JUST ATE IT.

260
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,910
I'M LIKE, WELL, THAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN AWFUL.

261
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:46,122
I PROBABLY STARED AT IT A LITTLE
TOO WRONG.

262
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,124
AND THEN I REALIZED.

263
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,834
JESSICA, YOU'RE STARING AT YOUR
CHIPS TOO LONG.

264
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:57,967
AND SO THEN I ROLLED IT UP UNTIL
I CAN GET A BETTER READ OF IT.

265
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,427
>> CHRISSY SEEMS SO NICE.

266
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,302
>> CHRISSY IS REALLY NICE.

267
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,847
>> AND ALAN LOOKS LIKE HE CAN BE
A HOTHEAD.

268
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:12,940
>> YEAH.

269
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:20,072
>> YEAH.

270
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,835
>> RIGHT NOW I FEEL LIKE I HAVE
A . OF POWER.

271
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:37,339
I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BLOCK
ANOTHER PLAYER'S VOTE AT THE

272
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,841
NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

273
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:43,512
"IF YOU WIN IMMUNITY AND DO NOT
GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL, YOU MUST

274
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:43,929
SEND THIS TO SOMEONE ON THE
LOSING TRIBE."

275
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,181
OH, MY GOODNESS.

276
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,683
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT KIND OF
CHAOS THIS COULD CAUSE WHEN IT'S

277
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:48,392
ACTUALLY USED.

278
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:53,022
SO I FEEL LUCKY THAT I FOUND IT.

279
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,940
SOMEBODY'S ANGEL.

280
00:12:55,024 --> 00:13:02,323
HERE YOU GO, MY FRIEND.

281
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,408
HEY, I FOUND A SECRET ADVANTAGE
IN MY CHIP BAG.

282
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,326
>> REALLY?

283
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,494
>> YEAH.

284
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,663
LONG STORY SHORT, IF WE GO THE
TRIBAL COUNCIL, I CAN BLOCK

285
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,415
SOMEONE'S VOTE SO IT DOESN'T
COUNT.

286
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,042
BUT IT HAS TO BE USED AS THE
NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

287
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:17,171
>> JESSICA JUST GAVE ME A HUGE
PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE.

288
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,840
KNOWLEDGE IS POWER IN SURVIVOR,
BUT I SHARED WITH JESSICA THAT

289
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,550
JOE HAD AN IDOL.

290
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,719
INSTANTLY HER NEXT REACTION WAS
TO GIVE ME A HUG, KISS ME ON THE

291
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,888
CHEEK, AND SAY I TRUST YOU NOW,
COLE.

292
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,891
I PLAN THE USE THAT SAME METHOD
WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

293
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,394
>> SO I'LL SHARE A SECRET WITH
YOU.

294
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:39,860
JESSICA HAS AN ADVANTAGE, AND IT
CANCELS OUT ONE OF YOU ALL'S

295
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:40,194
VOTES.

296
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:40,736
>> REALLY?

297
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,905
>> YEAH.

298
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,114
JESSICA'S SECRET SOUNDS LIKE MY
OLIVE BRANCH.

299
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,951
I CAN EXTEND THIS INFORMATION
AND MAYBE THEY'LL SEE ME AS MORE

300
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,911
TRUSTWORTHY BECAUSE I'VE CHOSEN
TO TELL THEM SOMETHING THAT I

301
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:54,416
HAD NO ONLY GIGS TO --
OBLIGATION TO TELL THEM IN THE

302
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,543
FIRST PLACE.

303
00:13:55,626 --> 00:14:03,926
SO JESSICA'S GOT AN ADVANTAGE IN
HER BAG OF POTATO CHIPS.

304
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:08,430
>> HOW CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

305
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,934
>> SUPPOSEDLY JESSICA GOT AN
ADVANTAGE IN THE BOTTOM OF HER

306
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,103
CHIP BAG, WHICH IS ODD THAT COLE
TOLD US THAT.

307
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:18,899
IT COULD BE THAT COLE WAS JUST
TELLING MYSELF AND BEN TO MAKE

308
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:22,611
US BELIEVE IN HIM, AND IF HE IS,
THAT'S GREAT, BUT I'D RATHER

309
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,946
JUST PUT MY FAITH IN MY OWN
HANDS.

310
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:37,084
SO I WILL BE USING YOUR LITTLE
SECRET TO MY ADVANTAGE.

311
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,796
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS BEACH.

312
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,089
>> WHAT WAS YOUR BEACH LIKE?

313
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:42,464
>> NOT LIKE THIS.

314
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,133
>> NOT PRETTY.

315
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:48,971
>> THE NEW SOKO IS MYSELF, J.P.,
AND CHRISSY FROM THE HEROES.

316
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,516
AND RYAN AND ALI FROM THE
HUSTLERS.

317
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,769
I PRETTY MUCH WENT FROM THE
TRIBE OF SIX HEALERS WHO WERE

318
00:14:55,853 --> 00:15:00,858
SUPER TIGHT TO THE LONE HEALER
OF SOKO BEACH.

319
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,109
SO WE ONLY SLEPT IN HERE THE
NIGHT IT RAINED.

320
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:05,654
>> WE DEFINITELY SLEPT IN OUR
SHELTER.

321
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,157
>> THE SWAP BRINGS SUCH ACT
DAYTY, BUT I'M VERY LUCKY THAT

322
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,202
CHRISSY WAS SWAPPED ON THE MY
TRIBE BECAUSE I AWARDED HER THE

323
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:17,207
SUPER IMMUNITY IDOL THAT I FOUND
ON THE BOAT DAY ONE, AND I

324
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,711
ENSURED HER SHE WOULD NOT BE THE
ONE GOING HOME THAT NIGHT, SO I

325
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,672
HAVE AN IN.

326
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,341
I JUST THINK IT'S COOL THAT
YOU'RE FROM JERSEY.

327
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,175
>> I KNOW.

328
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,509
>> I THINK WE'LL BE FRIENDS.

329
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,218
>> I THINK SO, TOO.

330
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,261
I WAS GLAD TO SEE YOU.

331
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:35,142
>> YOU KNOW, I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING, SO I FOUND AN

332
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:40,522
ADVANTAGE ON DAY ONE ON THE
BOAT, OKAY, AND THAT ADVANTAGE

333
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:46,487
WAS I COULD SAVE SOMEONE AT THE
FIRST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

334
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,864
>> I KNOW WHY YOU'RE TELLING ME
THIS OBVIOUSLY.

335
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:49,239
>> YEAH.

336
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:49,740
>> THANK YOU.

337
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:50,574
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

338
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,825
>> WHY DID YOU PICK ME?

339
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:57,373
>> I JUST HAD A GOOD VIBE, AND I
WANTED REALLY TO PLAY THE GAME

340
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,165
WITH YOU.

341
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,708
>> I FELT VERY LOVED WHEN I GOT
IT.

342
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:04,755
>> WELL, IT WAS EASY TO GIVE TO
YOU.

343
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:05,714
>> THAT IS SO NICE.

344
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,548
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

345
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,716
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

346
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,718
>> RYAN BLEW MY MIND.

347
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,013
HE TOTALLY GAVE ME THE SUPER
IDOL AND SERIOUSLY MADE ME FEEL

348
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,264
SO LOVED.

349
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,226
I THOUGHT, WHAT WAS IT ABOUT ME
ON THAT SHIP THAT HE LOOKED OVER

350
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,228
AND THOUGHT THAT I LOOKED LIKE A
KIND PERSON THAT HE WANTED TO

351
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,479
PLAY THIS GAME WITH.

352
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,732
MAYBE HE THOUGHT I WAS LIKE HIS
MOTHER AN HE WANTED TO PLAY THE

353
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,525
GAME WITH HIS MOTHER.

354
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,734
I DON'T KNOW.

355
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:29,363
I GIVE YOU MY WORD, I HATE TO
SAY PAY YOU BACK, BUT YOU KNOW

356
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:29,738
WHAT I MEAN.

357
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:30,572
>> I GOTCHA.

358
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,199
>> I AM ABSOLUTELY THRILLED.

359
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:37,371
I FEEL VERY, VERY SECURE,
BECAUSE NOW I HAVE ONE MORE

360
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:48,632
PERSON WHO CAN HELP ME GET
FURTHER IN THIS GAME.

361
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,925
>> WELCOME HOME.

362
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:51,260
>> THANK YOU.

363
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,594
>> DESI.

364
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:52,928
>> JOE.

365
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:54,763
>> ASHLEY.

366
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:59,101
>> HEY, GORGEOUS.

367
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,270
>> RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT TWO
HEROES.

368
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,815
WE HAVE ALAN AND ASHLEY, TWO
HEALERS, ME AND JOE, AND THEN

369
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:08,193
WE'VE GOT I THINK THE STRONGEST
OF ALL THE HUSTLERS IN DEVON IN

370
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,319
THE MIDDLE.

371
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,655
>> THANKS FOR BEING SO
WELCOMING.

372
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:15,409
IT WOULD BE EASY FOR THE FOUR OF
US TO THROW DEVON OUT, BUT I'D

373
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,162
RATHER WORK WITH HIM BECAUSE
HE'S POTENTIALLY THE SWING BOAT.

374
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:24,168
>> HOW YOU FEELING?

375
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:28,964
>> IF THERE WAS ONE PERSON OUT
OF ALL THREE TRIBES THAT I DID

376
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:33,761
NOT WANT ON MY NEW TRIBE, THAT
WOULD HAVE BEEN ALEX.

377
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,679
HE'S PROVEN TO BE THIS WILD CAR.

378
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:39,266
HE'LL CALL YOU OUT AND THREE
YOUR NAME UNDER THE BUS.

379
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:42,144
HE'S ALREADY DONE IT TO ME.

380
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,103
I WAS REALLY NERVOUS.

381
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:46,482
>> I KNOW I GOT HISTORY WITH
YOU.

382
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,526
>> YEAH, ALL THIS STUFF BETWEEN
ME AND YOU, DOESN'T MATTER.

383
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,155
THAT WAS LAST CHAPTER.

384
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,657
LUCKILY I THINK ALAN IS AS
NERVOUS AS I AM.

385
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,326
SO EVEN THOUGH I DON'T TRUST
HIM, I DO TRUST THAT HE DOESN'T

386
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:02,748
WANT TO GO HOME.

387
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:11,298
>> I GOTCHA.

388
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:14,676
>> BEN, WHERE IS YOUR HEAD AT
RIGHT NOW?

389
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,515
>> I'M JUST TRYING THE GET
FURTHER IN THIS GAME.

390
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,141
I LOVED MY TRIBE.

391
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,100
>> YEAH.

392
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,727
>> THANKS TO THE SWAP, IT'S A
WHOLE NEW GAME.

393
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:28,649
WHEN I WAS WITH THE HEALERS, WE
WON EVERY CHALLENGE, SO I HAD NO

394
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:29,316
WORRIES.

395
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,819
BUT NOW I'M NOT AS CONFIDENT.

396
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,363
IT'S TRUE, I DO HAVE AN IDOL,
BUT I'M NOT TAKING ANY CHANCES.

397
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,366
DEVON IS A SWING VOTE, AND I
WANT HIM ON MY SIDE.

398
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:46,125
THE THING IS, THEY KIND OF LIKE
SAID, WHY DON'T WE TAKE THEM.

399
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,377
I MAY BE HEALER, BUT I'M ALSO A
STRATEGIC PLAYER.

400
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:53,674
I SAID, LISTEN, DEVON, THEY WANT
TO VOTE YOU OUT, BUT I MADE IT

401
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,049
UP.

402
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:55,217
I DON'T CARE.

403
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,220
THIS IS A GAME OF BEING
DECEITFUL, SO I WANT TO DO WHAT

404
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,930
I HAVE TO DO.

405
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,099
>> WAS IT BETH OF THEM OR JUST
ALAN?

406
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,392
>> BOTH.

407
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,228
>> I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN REALLY
TRUST JOE, BUT THIS IS THE FIRST

408
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,565
TIME THAT I'VE FELT LIKE, SHOOT,
I MIGHT BE GOING HOME NEXT.

409
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:13,235
SO I GOT TO FIGURE OUT MY NEXT
MOVE OR I FEEL LIKE I COULD BE

410
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:24,079
IN BIG TROUBLE.

411
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,296
>> I THOUGHT WE WERE ALL GOING
OUT THERE.

412
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,505
I DON'T KNOW.

413
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:37,217
I JUST THINK IT'S FUNNY THAT
EVERY TIME YOU SEE THEM, THEY'RE

414
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,093
LIKE THIS.

415
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:39,428
BEN AND I ARE A LITTLE
OUTNUMBERED HERE.

416
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:43,432
THE ONLY WAY THE REALLY GAIN A
LITTLE BIT OF CONTROL WOULD BE

417
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,602
TO GET DR. MIKE TO JOIN US.

418
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:50,606
SO IF DR. MIKE DOESN'T KNOW THAT
JESSICA GOT THE ADVANTAGE, I'M

419
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,984
GOING TO USE THAT AGAINST THOSE
TWO.

420
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:57,112
DO YOU THINK THERE WAS AN
ADVANTAGE YESTERDAY?

421
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:58,614
>> I DON'T KNOW.

422
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,615
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

423
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,116
I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

424
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:02,951
LIKE WHERE WOULD IT HAVE BEEN.

425
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:03,493
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE
BASKET.

426
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,786
>> YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

427
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,123
I HEARD THERE WAS ONE IN A CHIP
BAG YESTERDAY, AND I DIDN'T GET

428
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:08,999
IT.

429
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,459
YOU DIDN'T GET IT, AND HE DIDN'T
GET IT.

430
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,252
AND YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT.

431
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,462
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

432
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:17,132
>> SO LAUREN SAYS THERE'S AN
ADVANTAGE IN THE GAME, WHICH

433
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:20,302
CLEARLY SOMEBODY FROM MY TRIBE
HAS THEN TOLD HER.

434
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,513
IT IS CLEAR TO ME IT'S COLE,
BECAUSE COLE SOMETIMES CAN'T

435
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,807
KEEP HIS MOUTH CLOSED.

436
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:32,648
AND THOSE THINGS COME BACK THE
BITE YOU IN THE BUTT.

437
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:36,818
>> HEY, IF YOU GUYS ARE PLAYING
ME...

438
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,697
>> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

439
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,741
>> THEY KNOW ABOUT YOUR
ADVANTAGE?

440
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,661
>> THEY KNOW ABOUT MY ADVANTAGE?

441
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,997
WHEN HE SAID THEY KNOW ABOUT THE
SECRET ADVANTAGE, EVERYTHING IN

442
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:54,378
MY CRASHED, BECAUSE ONLY TWO
PEOPLE KNEW, COLE, AND MIKE.

443
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,673
SO ONE OF THEM OPENED THEIR
MOUTH.

444
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,925
>> DID YOU TELL LAUREN ABOUT THE
ADVANTAGE?

445
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:04,304
>> SHE'S LIKE, MIKE, THERE'S AN
ADVANTAGE IN HER POTATO CHIPS.

446
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,848
>> HOW WOULD SHE KNOW ABOUT
THAT.

447
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,310
>> IN MY HEAD I'M LIKE CRAP,
CRAP, CRAP, CRAP, CRAP.

448
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,854
JESSICA IS GOING THE LOOK AT ME
AND THINK, COLE, YOU BETRAYED

449
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:13,605
ME.

450
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,816
>> EITHER YOU OR HIM TOLD
LAUREN.

451
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:16,858
I DIDN'T TELL LAUREN.

452
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,486
>> I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T HAVE
GONE AND TOLD LAUREN.

453
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,864
THAT'S THERE'S NO BENEFIT TO
TELL HER.

454
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:36,586
>> SOMEBODY TOLD HER.

455
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,880
>> I'M SO SORRY.

456
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,340
I MENTIONED IT TO BEN.

457
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:44,011
I THOUGHT IT WOULD EXTEND TRUST
TO HIM.

458
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,179
>> COLBURNED ME BAD.

459
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,974
HE CAN'T EVEN KEEP A SECRET FOR
A DAY.

460
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:52,394
>> THE SAME REASON I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE IDOL.

461
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,564
>> COLE, BUT YOU HAVE TO PROTECT
THAT KNOWLEDGE A LITTLE BIT.

462
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:59,234
IT'S MY PREROGATIVE ON WHO I
TELL WHAT I HAVE, YOU KNOW?

463
00:21:59,317 --> 00:21:59,985
YOU HURT ME.

464
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,529
WHETHER HE MEANT TO OR NOT, HE
DID.

465
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,906
BUT I WOULD NEVER ADMIT THAT TO
HIM.

466
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,410
WHEN I GET HURT, I ALWAYS
WONDER, WAS IT ME, AND DID I

467
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:12,247
CHOOSE TO FORM A RELATIONSHIP
WITH SOMEONE THAT I JUST

468
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:12,831
SHOULDN'T HAVE?

469
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,916
AND THAT'S WHY I GOT HURT.

470
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,085
THAT'S HOW I FEEL NOW WITH COLE.

471
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,422
DID I MAKE A POOR DECISION FROM
THE BEGINNING, AND HOW DO I MOVE

472
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,925
FORWARD IN THIS GAME THINKING
THAT?

473
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,261
SO, YEAH, I HAD TO SWALLOW THAT.

474
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:36,980
IT HURTS.

475
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:47,074
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

476
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:52,412
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!

477
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,455
ALL RIGHT.

478
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,664
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?

479
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:55,665
>> YES, SIR.

480
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:59,669
>> Jeff: FIRST THINGS FIRST,
TAKE BACK THE IDOLS.

481
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:00,128
ROARK.

482
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:00,962
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

483
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:06,968
>> Jeff: ASHLEY.

484
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,304
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY BACK UP FOR
GRABS.

485
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:12,766
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO RACE OUT TO A LARGE

486
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:17,145
CRATE OF PUZZLE PIECINGS AND
MANEUVER THAT CRATE THROUGH A

487
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,106
TABLE OBSTACLE AND UNDER A NET.

488
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:22,651
ONCE YOU REACH THE FINISH,
YOU'LL UNLOCK YOUR SECOND SET OF

489
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,902
PUZZLE PIECES.

490
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:27,531
YOU'LL THEN ARRANGE THOSE PIECES
SO EACH INTERSECTION IS THE SAME

491
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:30,075
COLOR.

492
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:35,330
FIRST TWO TRIBES TO FINISH WIN
IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM THE VOTE.

493
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,457
LOSERS, TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FOURTH

494
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,709
PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.

495
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,462
TAKE A MINUTE THE STRATEGIZE.

496
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,464
WE'LL GET STARTED.

497
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:48,844
DO IT.

498
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:49,219
ALL RIGHT.

499
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,179
HERE WE GO.

500
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:55,058
FOR IMMUNITY, SURVIVORS READY?

501
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:59,855
GO!

502
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:04,025
THAT CRATE OF PUZZLE PIECES IS
HEAVY.

503
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,988
AND ALREADY YAWA FEELS THE
WEIGHT OF IT.

504
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:15,829
YOU NOW HAVE TO MANEUVER IT
THROUGH A TABLE OBSTACLE.

505
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:21,209
THE BIG QUESTION IS: ARE YOUR
TRIBE MATES HELPING YOU, OR ARE

506
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,713
THEY THROWING A MONKEY WRENCH
INTOOFF PLANS?

507
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:25,213
>> GO BACK.

508
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,382
>> YOU, YOU, YOU.

509
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:28,466
ME, ME, ME.

510
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,593

00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,715
>> I DO NOT THINK THAT IS RIGHT.

572
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,217
THERE ARE NO TWO ENDS THAT ARE
RED.

00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,886
>> Jeff: WHERE THE PIECES
INTERSECT, THE COLORS MUST

SWITCH 'EM, SWITCH 'EM, SWITCH

583
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,744
>> Jeff: YELLOW THINKS THEY
HAVE SOMETHING.

584
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:01,828
>> THIS IS NOT RIGHT.

585
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,204
>> THAT'S IN THE RIGHT.

586
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,373
>> Jeff: SOMETHING IS NOT
RIGHT FOR SOKO.

587
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,501
THEY GOT TO RETHINK IT.

589
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:10,712

>> YES, YES!

592
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:15,842
>> Jeff: WE'RE FLAT.

593
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,720
ARE WE FLAT?

594
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,765
YAWA THINKS THEY HAVE IT, AND
THEY DO.

595
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:26,895
YAWA WINS IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM
TRIBAL.

WE ARE NECK AND NECK RIGHT NOW.

00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,278
IT'S A RACE TO THE FINISH.

00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,614
>> THIS IS YELLOW, WHITE,
YELLOW.

603
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,199
>> Jeff: SOKO PUT THE LAST
PIECE.

604
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:44,412
IF THEY'RE RIGHT, SOKO THINKS
THEY HAVE IT.

605
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,748
AND THEY DO.

606
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:54,923
SOKO WINS IMMUNITY, SAFE FROM
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

607
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,134
SOMEBODY FROM LEVU WILL BE THE
FOURTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS

608
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:58,593
GAME.

609
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,261

00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:14,067
NOBODY GOING HOME FROM SOKO.

617
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,277
YAWA, SOKO, GRAB YOUR STUFF,
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

618
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,612
NO TRIBAL TONIGHT.

619
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:18,947
ALL RIGHT, LEVU.

620
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,198
SOMEBODY GOING HOME TONIGHT,
SOMEBODY WILL BE THE FOURTH

GRAB YOU STUFF, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

623
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,288
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

624
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,958
>> TONIGHT I HAVE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO BLOCK A LEVU

625
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,794
PLAYER WHO VOTES AT TRIBAL
COUNCIL.

626
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:36,256
THE GOAL IS TO HELP THE HEALERS,
SO I'M GOING TO DISRUPT THE LEVU

627
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,383
TRIBE AS MUCH AS I CAN.

628
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,777
>> THE KEYS WERE SUCH LUCK.

629
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:58,570
>> WE JUST COULDN'T DO THE
PUZZLE.

630
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,488
>> IT WAS THE VERY LAST ONE I
TRIED.

631
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,157
>> DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT THAT.

632
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,617
I THINK EVERYONE WAS JUST ON
THEIR OWN PAGE INSTEAD OF

633
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,076
WORKING TOGETHER.

634
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,995
>> WE LOST AGAIN.

635
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,539
IT WAS DEFLATING.

636
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:14,002
SO YOU GOT ME AND ASH, YOU GOT
DESI AND JOE, AND THEN YOU GOT

637
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,170
DEVON.

638
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,838
NO QUESTION DEVON IS A SWING
VOTE, AND WHOEVER HE GOES WITH

639
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:23,845
IS GOING TO COME OUT ON TOP.

640
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:27,849
>> DEVON, I DON'T WANT YOU TO
THINK THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE THE

641
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:31,519
ODD ONE OUT YOU'D BE TARGET,
BECAUSE THE HEALERS NEED TO GO.

642
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,147
>> LISTEN, ARE YOU TELLING THE
TRUTH RIGHT NOW?

643
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,857
>> 100%?

644
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,149
YEAH.

645
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,150
>> OKAY.

646
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:40,487
BECAUSE JOE TOLD ME THAT YOU
WANT TO VOTE ME OUT.

647
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,696
>> REALLY?

648
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:42,405
THAT'S [BLEEPED].

649
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,072
WE DON'T WANT YOU TO GO.

650
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,991
IT MAKES NO SENSE.

651
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:45,783
>> ALL RIGHT.

652
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,368
YOU GUYS DIDN'T EVEN CONSIDER
THAT?

653
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,828
>> NOT EVEN FOR A SECOND.

654
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:49,245
>> ALL RIGHT.

655
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:49,662
WOW.

656
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,623
THAT IS SCARY.

657
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:52,999
TO PULL SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

658
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:54,209
WHAT A SKETCHY DUDE.

659
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:59,047
>> WHEN JOE TOLD ME THAT ASHLEY
WANTED TO VOTE ME OUT, I HAD A

660
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,258
GUT FEELING WHEN THEY'RE GOING
ME THAT WHOLE PITCH, I FELT LIKE

661
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,053
I WAS BEING TALKED TO BY A CAR
SALESMAN.

662
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,095
I WAS LIKE, THIS MIGHT BE A LIE.

663
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,890
AND NOW I THINK IT WAS.

664
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,225
>> HE'S A PLAYER.

665
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,519
>> THAT'S WHY I LIKE TALKING TO
YOU.

666
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,061
YOU SEEM THE MOST HONEST.

667
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:16,105
I THINK I CAN TRUST ASH.

668
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:20,443
ALSOIAN -- ALAN SEEMS LIKE A
STRAIGHTFORWARD GUY.

669
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:23,238
JOE IS A SNAKE, AND I DON'T LIKE
HAVING SNAKES AROUND.

670
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:23,905
>> OH, MY GOD.

671
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,240
LET'S DO IT.

672
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,908
>> ALL RIGHT.

673
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:35,750
>> Jeff:>> THAT JUST MADE ME SO
>> I SAW ASHLEY AND DEVON IN THE

674
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:36,960
WATER.

675
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:41,089
I'M NOT SURE WHAT THEY SAID, BUT
AT THE END OF IT, THEY HUGGED.

676
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,674
>> REALLY?

677
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:45,552
>> IT LOOKS LIKE DEVON COULD BE
PLAYING ME.

678
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:48,263
I THINK HE HAS THIS EMOTIONAL
CONNECTION WITH ASHLEY.

679
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,223
HE'S A SURFER DUDE.

680
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,225
AND ASHLEY IS ALL ABOUT THE
BEACH.

681
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,935
SO I DON'T FEEL CONFIDENT.

682
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,980
>> HE'S GOING TO COME AFTER ME
FIRST.

683
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:59,941
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO PLAY THE
IDOL, BUT IF I PLAY IT TONIGHT

684
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:03,778
AND THEY VOTE OUT DESI, THEN I
JUST WASTED AN IDOL AND I'M

685
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:06,739
NEXT, SO IF I'M GOING TO GET ONE
OF THEM OUT, I HAVE TO MAKE SURE

686
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:15,623
THEY VOTE FOR ME.

687
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:20,336
>> SO IS THIS THE PART THAT WE
JUST ACT LIKE EVERYTHING'S COOL,

688
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:20,837
OR...

689
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,921
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

690
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,133
>> I'M JUST SAYING, WE'RE GOING
THE TRIBAL TONIGHT.

691
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:30,096
I'VE BEEN IN THIS GAME FOR 11
GAMES.

692
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,306
I DON'T KNOW WHO IS PART OF MY
ALLIANCE.

693
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,976
I WANT TO KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO
MOVE FORWARD AS A STRONG TRIBE,

694
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,605
OR WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO,
ALL RIGHT, SO WE STARTED OFF

695
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:39,480
YELLOW OR WE STARTED OFF BLUE.

696
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,149
>> SOMEBODY GOT TO GO HOME
TONIGHT, BRO.

697
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:44,444
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING, ARE
WE NOT GOING TO ACKNOWLEDGE.

698
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,112
>> IT'S ACKNOWLEDGED.

699
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,447
SOMEBODY IS GOING HOME TONIGHT.

700
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,782
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT WE'RE
NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT AT

701
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:50,575
ALL.

702
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:51,868
>> WHO DO YOU THINK SHOULD GO
HOME?

703
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,161
YOU BROUGHT IT UP AND EVERYBODY
GOT TO VOTE.

704
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,078
WHO YOU VOTING FOR IN.

705
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,163
>> ALL RIGHT.

706
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,623
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT.

707
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:57,790
WE HAD TWO CHALLENGES.

708
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:58,958
WE LOST BOTH CHALLENGES.

709
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,169
SO HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD
STRONGER THAN WE ARE RIGHT NOW?

710
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,297
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO
MAKE US STRONGER?

711
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,467
>> I DON'T MIND, I'LL PUT MY
VOTE OUT THERE.

712
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,509
I'M VOTING FOR ASHLEY.

713
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,219
I THINK THE STRONGEST FOUR IS US
FOUR.

714
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:14,349
>> JOE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT WHO
WE'RE GETTING RID OF, AND, OF

715
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,643
COURSE, IT'S MY NAME THAT COMES
UP.

716
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,186
>> WHAT MAKES DESI STRONGER THAN
ASHLEY?

717
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,020
>> PLEASE.

718
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:22,398
>> I THINK DESI'S STRONGER IN
PUZZLES.

719
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:22,982
>> HOW?

720
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:27,195
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN HOW?

721
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,196
>> THERE'S ALWAYS A PUZZLE.

722
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,156
YOU'RE NOT GOOD AT PUZZLES.

723
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,659
>> THIS IS TOTAL BULL CRAP.

724
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,870
I DON'T THINK I'M THE WEAKEST
LINK BY ANY MEANS.

725
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:37,205
HE HAS TO KNOW THE MORE HE
PISSES PEOPLE OFF, THE MORE

726
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,540
PEOPLE WANT TO GET RID OF HIM.

727
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:43,252
>> I'M NOT VOTING FOR ASHLEY OR
DESI.

728
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,338
>> FAIR ENOUGH.

729
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:48,883
>> SO I GUESS OUR NAME IS ON THE
CHOPPING BLOCK.

730
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:50,551
>> LET YOUR MAN DO THE MATH.

731
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:54,055
>> JOE JUST BLEW UP CAMP AND IN
THE PROCESS HE BLEW UP BOTH OF

732
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:54,847
OUR GAMES.

733
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:55,390
>> YOU JUST BLEW YOUR WHOLE SPOT
UP.

734
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,392
>> YOU'LL SEE TONIGHT.

735
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,060
YOU ALL MY BE SURPRISED TONIGHT.

736
00:32:59,143 --> 00:32:59,727
I GUARANTEE YOU THAT.

737
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,689
>> THAT WAS AN IDIOTIC MOVE.

738
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,524
NOW MY NAME IS ON THE CHOPPING
BLOCK.

739
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:08,069
I'M JUST PISSED OFF AND ALREADY
DEVASTATED AND I HAVEN'T EVEN

740
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:11,572
GOT TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

741
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,242
>> SHE'S PROBABLY UPSET, BUT I
HAD TO GET THE TARGET OFF YOU

742
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,201
SOMEHOW.

743
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:18,287
>> LISTEN, I HAVE AN IDOL, OKAY,
SO TRUST ME.

744
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,372
THE FAR GET IS ON MY BACK.

745
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:23,084
>> NO, IT'S NOT, BECAUSE YOU
CAME IN TOO CONFIDENTLY.

746
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,877
NOW THEY'RE GOING TO ASSUME YOU
HAVE THE IDOL.

747
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,963
>> TRUST ME, YOU CAN'T THINK
LIKE THAT.

748
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:27,630
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW...

749
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,257
>> THEN PLAY THE IDOL FOR ME.

750
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,550
>> WHAT?

751
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:33,136
>> YOU PLAY THE ID.L. ON ME AND
THEN I GOT YOU FROM HERE ON OUT,

752
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:36,764
BUT AT THIS POINT IN TIME, YOU
JUST THROUGH ME UNDER THE BUS.

753
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:40,435
>> I KIND OF SCREWED UP, YOU
KNOW, I WANTED TO START CHAOS,

754
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:44,021
AND I DID, BUT IT KIND OF
BACKFIRED A LITTLE BIT, BECAUSE

755
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,607
NOW DESI'S NERVOUS THEY MIGHT
VOTED FOR HER.

756
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,233
I WAS LIKE, CRAP.

757
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:50,945
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

758
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:53,781
I'M TELLING YOU, I'M WILLING TO
GIVE YOU THE IDOL, BECAUSE IF I

759
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,199
DON'T HAVE YOU, I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING.

760
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:59,245
SO ME GIVING YOU THE IDOL IS AN
EXTRA THREE DAYS FOR US TO FIND

761
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,288
SOME CRACK.

762
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,248
IT'S EASY OF ME TO WORK CRABS
TOGETHER BY MYSELF.

763
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:05,585
>> GIVE ME A NAME, I'LL WRITE IT
DOWN.

764
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,295
>> THEY'RE BOTH WRITING MY NAME
DOWN?

765
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:11,340
>> TO BE HONEST, YOU SHOULD
WORRY, IF YOU HAVE AN IDOL,

766
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,633
THEY'RE WRITING MY NAME DOWN.

767
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,426
>> THEY'RE WRITING MY NAME DOWN.

768
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:16,637
>> NOW EVERYTHING IS UP IN THE
AIR.

769
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,140
IF HE PULLS OUT THE IDOL, ONE OF
US ARE GOING HOME.

770
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,683
HE MAY HAVE AN IDOL.

771
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:21,642
SHE MAY HAVE AN IDOL.

772
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:28,775
>> WE HAVE TO PICK ONE.

773
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:34,155
>> SECRET ADVANTAGE, DO NOT OPEN
UNTIL IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

774
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,448
NO WAY!

775
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:41,329
WE'RE ABOUT THE GO TO TRIBAL,
AND I DISCOVER IN MY BAG A

776
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,455
SECRET ADVANTAGE.

777
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:45,625
IF I HAVE A SECRET ADMIRER, THAT
IS A BEAUTIFUL THING.

778
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,001
IT COULD BE AN EXTRA VOTE.

779
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,962
IT COULD BE ANYTHING, LIKE I
HAVE NO IDEA.

780
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:53,341
BUT WITH THAT AND BEING THE
SWING VOTE, I HAVE ALL OF THE

781
00:34:53,424 --> 00:35:04,268
POWER IN MY HANDS.

782
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:10,024
POWER IN MY HANDS.

783
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,238
>> Jeff: FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO
HAVEN'T BEEN TO TRIBAL YET, GRAB

784
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:15,696
A TORCH.

785
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:21,536
GET FIRE.

786
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,872
THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL AT
TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS

787
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,374
GAME, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.

788
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:30,711
WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO ARE
YOU.

789
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:31,712
ALL RIGHT.

790
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:35,383
SO ALAN, OFF THE A TOUGH START
AS A NEW TRIBE.

791
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,344
WAIT, WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED
AND THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE IS

792
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:38,886
DISGUST.

793
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,389
>> IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.

794
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,099
>> Jeff: LET'S GET INTO IT.

795
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,100
WHAT HAPPENED?

796
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,102
>> WE GOT BACK THE CAMP AND
THINGS SPARKED OFF.

797
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:49,063
SOME PEOPLE WERE A LITTLE
ANXIOUS TO GET TRIBAL STARTED.

798
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:52,441
>> WELL, WE CAME FROM A LOSS,
AND I WANTED TO DISCUSS IT.

799
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:56,237
AND UNLIKE ALAN, I JUST SPEAK MY
MIND.

800
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,408
ALAN GOT UPSET AND HE'S LIKE,
YOU NEED THE CALM DOWN, YOU'RE

801
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:01,075
UPSET.

802
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:01,951
I WASN'T UPSET.

803
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:02,743
I JUST WANTED TO DISCUSS IT.

804
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,246
SO I THREW ASHLEY'S NAME OUT
THERE.

805
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:13,754
>> Jeff: ASHLEY, YOU COULD NOT
HAVE LIKED BEING REFERRED TO.

806
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:18,134
>> JEFF, I HAVE NEVER BEEN
REFERRED TO THE WEAKEST LINK.

807
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:18,843
ME HAD TO PICK SOMEONE.

808
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,887
HE WENT FOR THE EASIEST TRIBES.

809
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,723
HIS ACTIONS OR HIS WORDS MIGHT
AFFECT HIM TONIGHT.

810
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,766
>> Jeff: DESI, THAT WAS A
REALLY HONEST STATEMENT.

811
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,475
>> YEAH.

812
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,435
I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT OUT OF JOE.

813
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,728
NAMES WERE THROWN OUT.

814
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:32,273
AND PART OF WHAT HAPPENED WAS I
GOT THROWN UNDER THE BUS IN THE

815
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,316
PROCESS.

816
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:36,819
>> Jeff: ALAN, IS DESI'S
CONCERN FAIR BASED ON WHAT

817
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:37,236
HAPPENED AT CAMP?

818
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,529
>> ABSOLUTELY.

819
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,782
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU BRING IN
THINGS LIKE TALK OF AN IDOL.

820
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:45,912
I'M GOING TO BE QUITE FRANK, BY
VOTE IS BETWEEN HER AND JOE.

821
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,455
>> Jeff: JOE, THIS IS LIKE A
MOVIE.

822
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,623
>> IT'S BETTER THAN A MOVIE.

823
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,458
>> Jeff: IT'S LIKE THAT MOMENT
WHERE THEY WANT TO GET THE BAD

824
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,418
GUY, SO THEY GET THE BAD GUY BY
GETTING HIS WIFE.

825
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:56,797
>> THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANTED AT
ALL, BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE I GOT

826
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:00,635
A LOT OF INFORMATION FROM ALAN
KNOWING HE'S SUPPORTING ASHLEY.

827
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,929
HIS DIVIDE WAS MADE BY HIM.

828
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:07,808
SO THANK YOU, ALAN, I APPRECIATE
IT.

829
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,186
>> Jeff: WOW.

830
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,354
DEVON.

831
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:12,939
REALLY INTERESTING FOR YOU,
BECAUSE WHEN YOU FIRST HAD THE

832
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:16,359
SWITCH, YOU COULD ARGUE, I'M THE
ODD PERSON OUT, AND NOW IT

833
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:20,696
SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE TWO HEALERS,
TWO HERO, AND YOU SITTING IN THE

834
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,822
MIDDLE.

835
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,659
>> YEAH, IT'S OUT IN THE OPEN
THAT I AM THE SWING VOTE.

836
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:29,455
AND MY VOTE IS BASED ON WHO DO I
THINK I CAN WORK WITH AND MOVE

837
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:32,041
FORWARD WITH IN THIS GAME.

838
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:33,542
>> Jeff: SO, JOE, THIS IS A
REAL SHOWDOWN.

839
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,585
>> YEAH.

840
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:38,130
I MEAN, ALAN WANTS ME OUT
BECAUSE I'M NOT A HERO.

841
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,465
I'M NOT GOOD FOR HIS GAME.

842
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:42,718
I'M SURE SHE'S NOT GOOD FOR HIS
GAME BECAUSE WE'RE NOT HEROES.

843
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:46,013
YOU CAN'T BEN TRAIT THE HERO, SO
WHY LET THE HEROES STAY AROUND

844
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:46,847
WHEN THERE'S NO CRACKS.

845
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,808
LONG-TERM YOU NEED TO GET RID OF
THEM.

846
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:49,642
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

847
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:53,938
>> HE SAYS THE HEROES CAN'T BE
BROKEN.

848
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,106
THE HEALERS WERE UNDEFEATED.

849
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:58,317
IF YOU DO THE NUMBERS, DO YOU
WANT TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF

850
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,485
SEVEN?

851
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:02,488
JOE WAS THE PERSON HANGING OFF
THE CLIFF THAT YOU SEE EACH

852
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:06,033
FINGER PEELING OFF BECAUSE HE'S
SCRATCHING AND CLAWING AT

853
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,201
WHATEVER HE CAN.

854
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:09,078
>> Jeff: DEVON, IF EVERYBODY
HERE IS READY TO LAY ON THE

855
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:12,415
SWORD FOR THEIR PARTNER, THE
PRESSURE ON YOU IS ENORMOUS TO

856
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,500
MAKE THE MOVE THAT MOVES YOU
FORWARD.

857
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:19,046
>> WELL, EVERY DECISION I HAVE
MADE HAS BEEN, IS THIS GOING TO

858
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:24,343
FURTHER MY GAME, AND MY DECISION
IS GOING THE STAY THE SAME EVERY

859
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,052
TRIBAL COUNCIL I ATTEND.

860
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,513
>> WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU?

861
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,640
>> Jeff: IT SOUNDS LIKE WE
HAVE A SHOWDOWN ABOUT THE

862
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:30,141
HAPPEN.

863
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:34,520
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

864
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:39,608
>> JEFF, I GOT A LITTLE
SOMETHING.

865
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:43,529
IT SAYS "DO NOT OPEN UNTIL IT IS
TIME TO VOTE," WHICH IS RIGHT

866
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:44,030
NOW.

867
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,698
>> Jeff: GO FOR IT.

868
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:47,241
>> I'M VERY CURIOUS.

869
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:50,077
>> Jeff: I THINK EVERYBODY
ELSE IS REALLY CURIOUS, TOO.

870
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,245
>> OKAY.

871
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:56,459
IT READS, "THIS IS A SECRET
ADVANTAGE, BUT IT IS BEING USED

872
00:38:56,542 --> 00:39:03,257
AGAINST YOU BY ANOTHER PLAYER TO
BLOCK YOUR VOTE AT TONIGHT'S

873
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:08,596
TRIBAL COUNCIL."

874
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:13,642
THAT IS NOT AN ADVANTAGE.

875
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:17,563
>> Jeff: DEVON, JUST TO MAKE
SURE WE'RE CLEAR, THAT ADVANTAGE

876
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:20,775
IS BEING USED TO BLOCK YOU FROM
VOTING, MEANING DEVON CAN TILL

877
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,943
BE VOTED OUT, HE JUST WON'T
VOTE.

878
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,945
EVERYBODY ELSE VOTES, AND YOU
CAN VOTE FOR ANYBODY.

879
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,073
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

880
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:27,448
ALL RIGHT.

881
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,784
TIME TO VOTE?

882
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:41,670
JOE, YOU'RE UP.

883
00:39:54,934 --> 00:40:01,816
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

884
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,485
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

885
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:11,492
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

886
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:22,294
>> I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU,
JEFF.

887
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,547
CAN I KEEP IT FOR MYSELF OR GIVE
IT TO SOMEBODY?

888
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,215
>> Jeff: YES.

889
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:33,806
>> ALL RIGHT.

890
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:41,147
SO I'LL KEEP IT FOR MYSELF.

891
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,523
>> Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

892
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:46,527
ANY VOTES CAST FOR JOE WILL NOT
COUNT.

893
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:52,241
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

894
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:52,700
FIRST VOTE JOE.

895
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:57,538
DOES NOT COUNT.

896
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:58,205
JOE.

897
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:07,715
DOES NOT COUNT.

898
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:08,757
ALAN.

899
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:14,513
THAT'S ONE VOTE ALAN.

900
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,183
FOURTH PERSON VOTED OUT, ALAN.

901
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,018
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

902
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:19,685
>> DETROIT, HOLLER BACK, BABY.

903
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:22,563
>> YOU GOT IT.

904
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,565
>> I READ YOUR FACE.

905
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:32,448
THANK YOU, GIRL.

906
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:36,577
>> Jeff: ALAN, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

907
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,413
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

908
00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:49,673
>> BYE, ALAN.

909
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:55,721
>> THAT WAS CRAZY.

910
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:59,892
WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?

911
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:03,270
>> Jeff: WELL, ONE OF THE
GREAT TRUTHS ABOUT "SURVIVOR,"

912
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,899
YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE PLANS YOU
WANT, "SURVIVOR" GODS DON'T

913
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:07,608
CARE.

914
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:08,984
GRAB YOUR TORCHES.

915
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:09,610
HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

916
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:15,032
GOOD NIGHT.

FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

921
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,965
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," TO WIN YOU HAVE TO

922
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:37,721
GET DIRTY --
THAT IS HOW YOU DO IT RIGHT HERE

923
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:38,973
-- BE RUTHLESS.

924
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,016
>> SHE WANTS TO DO AN ALL-GIRL
ALLIANCE.

925
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,268
>> OH, SHE'S GOT TO GO.

926
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,436
>> Jeff: AND HAVE A
WILLINGNESS TO RISK IT ALL.

927
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,562
>> IT'S 2-2.

928
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,856
>> WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER.

929
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,108
THE NEXT VOTE IS GOING TO ROCK.

930
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:52,987
>> I DON'T KNOW WHERE DEVON CAME
UP WITH THIS THING OR WHAT HE

931
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,864
PULLED, BUT IT FELL APART.

932
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:58,867
I BLAME A LOT OF MY FATE ON THAT
DAMN IMMUNITY IDOL.

933
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:04,873
WE DISCUSSED PUTTING VOTES
TOWARD DESI, BUT I HAVE TO GIVE

934
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:05,833
CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE.

935
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:06,917
THEY PLAYED A HELL OF A GAME,
AND THEY GOT ME.
