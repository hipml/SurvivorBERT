3
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:06,423
Two tribes-- Jalapao in red and

4
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,466
Timbira in black-- were stranded

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,050
in Brazil's Tocantins.

6
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,594
Take a look around-- Brazilian

7
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:12,178
highlands.

8
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,222
Beautiful part of Brazil,

9
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:15,140
but extremely harsh.

10
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:18,226
(thunder rumbles)

11
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:19,185
One person from each tribe is

12
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,688
not going to make this journey.

13
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:23,815
Based only on first impressions,

14
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,233
the tribes believed they were

15
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:26,234
voting out one of their own.

16
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:28,403
>> Zebra-striped top.

17
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:29,446
>> Sierra, head over.

18
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,447
>> Older lady.

19
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,406
>> PROBST: Sandy, you can't be

20
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:31,781
happy about this.

21
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:32,949
>> I'm pissed.

22
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:33,825
>> PROBST: But the game wasn't

23
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,160
over for Sandy and Sierra.

24
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:37,579
They had only been voted off the

25
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:38,747
trek.

26
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,330
They were flown to their tribe

27
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,082
camps in a helicopter, leaving

28
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,626
their unhappy tribe mates to

29
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,670
walk for hours.

30
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,881
>> This thing is getting heavy.

31
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,132
I mean, really heavy.

32
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:49,632
>> PROBST: Alone in their

33
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,010
camps, Sandy and Sierra

34
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,428
discovered a clue to a hidden

35
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:54,554
immunity idol.

36
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:55,722
>> People may think this is a

37
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:56,264
really stupid idea, but...

38
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,307
>> PROBST: Instead of searching

39
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,267
for the idol, Sierra decided to

40
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,061
win over the Timbira tribe with

41
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,396
hard work, which might have

42
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:03,646
succeeded.

43
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,523
>> Well, you know, Sierra, we

44
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:05,857
all love her.

45
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,941
>> PROBST: Or not.

46
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:07,817
>> But even though she's

47
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,318
awesome, she's got to go.

48
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,319
>> PROBST: Sandy searched for

49
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,196
the idol at Jalapao and came up

50
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,363
short.

51
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,073
>> Wonder what a pace is.

52
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:14,741
>> PROBST: Putting her in

53
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:15,825
danger.

54
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,119
Carolina struggling to stay up.

55
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,038
(cheering)

56
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,498
But when Jalapao suffered their

57
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,665
first loss...

58
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,042
Jalapao, Tribal Council tonight.

59
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,251
The first person will be voted

60
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,628
out of this game, and it's

61
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:27,420
coming from your tribe.

62
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:31,633
...Sandy was in deep trouble.

63
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,300
But Carolina's bossiness...

64
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,385
>> Let's try to get everything

65
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,261
done as soon as possible.

66
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,262
When it comes to, like,

67
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,473
working, I can get very

68
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:38,765
opinionated.

69
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:39,974
>> PROBST: ...made for a

70
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:40,350
surprise decision.

71
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,186
Carolina, the tribe has spoken.

72
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,188
Sandy narrowly escaped.

73
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,524
Can she survive another week?

74
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,775
15 are left.

75
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,443
Who will be voted out tonight?

76
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,534
>> Look around the outside of...

77
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:01,037
(chattering quietly)

78
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,377
>> It's not like we just picked

79
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,169
randomly.

80
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,087
>> No, I know.

81
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,004
>> I made it through Tribal

82
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,506
Council by a landslide.

83
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,842
I think Carolina played her, uh,

84
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,844
cards terribly wrong, and so

85
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,679
she's kept me in this game so

86
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,765
far.

87
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:21,641
(Sandy laughs)

88
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,059
Lord, thank you!

89
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,102
That's our boy.

90
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,270
He said, "We're going to have

91
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,855
fire," didn't you, honey?

92
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,648
I believe I'm underestimated in

93
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:29,232
this game.

94
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,900
I want to win this thing.

95
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,652
And as long as I'm here, I can

96
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:33,903
win it.

97
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:34,404
Thank you all so much for

98
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,239
letting me hang in here with

99
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,699
you all for a few more days.

the team, you know.

102
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:40,410
>> Oh, thank you so much.

103
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,537
>> Now that Carolina is out, I

104
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,205
mean, we all pretty much agreed

105
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,498
that she just swapped places

106
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,374
with Sandy.

107
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,084
Sandy was going to be first

108
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,252
and then Carolina after that.

109
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,962
Now Carolina was first and now

110
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,965
Sandy after that.

00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,807
I love it!

195
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,476
>> Maybe I'll just wait.

196
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,019
>> I didn't try the worm.

197
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,188
After I saw Stephen's face...

198
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,439
(groans)

199
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:56,606
Uh-uh.

200
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,565
I mean, I'll eat one at a

201
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,525
challenge if I need to, but not

202
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,151
in real life.

203
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,403
>> So good, so good.

204
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,791
>> Gonna go, like, one of those.

205
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,503
Come on, come on, come on, come

206
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,629
on, come on, come on, come on.

207
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,464
Come on, come on, come on, come

208
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:21,756
on, come on.

209
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,465
Don't.

210
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,717
All right, breakfast is after

211
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,384
noon.

212
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,888
(chuckles)

213
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,973
>> Day one, my tribe tried to

214
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:31,808
vote me out.

215
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,976
I think they all perceive me

216
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,228
as the weakest link.

217
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,480
And instead, I came here and

218
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,689
there was a clue for a hidden

219
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,983
immunity idol, but I haven't

220
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,735
had a chance to look for it.

221
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,445
I'm still on the outs in my

222
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,989
tribe, so I most definitely

223
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,032
need to find it.

224
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:48,658
And I need someone to help me

225
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,575
with that.

226
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,708
In this game, you need people

227
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,042
on your side.

228
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,460
And Brendan's the one person

229
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,586
that didn't vote for me.

230
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,462
So he was the one I trusted the

231
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,589
most.

232
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:07,802
>> I'm glad you did.

233
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:08,928
Thank you.

234
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,560
Oh, really?

235
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:16,519
All right, but totally got

236
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,854
your back.

237
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,230
Sierra needed some help to

238
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,314
figure this out.

239
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,399
I think she didn't necessarily

240
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,358
feel comfortable that the tribe

241
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:24,026
was not going to vote her off

242
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,736
in the first Tribal Council,

243
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,946
and I think it's important

244
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,989
taking a look for.

245
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:31,534
It can't hurt.

246
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,246
>> The first clue, it said,

247
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,664
"The stick marks the spot on

248
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,249
your biggest beach.

249
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,917
Dig for a while and assistance

250
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,712
you'll reach."

251
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,506
Oh, I got it!

252
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,968
Oh, my God.

253
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,386
Okay.

254
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:52,054
"With your back to the river,

255
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,556
walk towards the lone tree.

256
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,726
Dig after ten paces at the

257
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,228
place where you'll be."

258
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,112
>> Yeah.

259
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,823
>> Yeah.

260
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,253
>> We'll probably figure it out

261
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,213
when we get there.

262
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,172
>> Should I go check on Brendan

263
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,340
and Sierra and make sure

264
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,633
they're still alive?

265
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:29,508
>> Go.

266
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:29,967
I'll wait here.

267
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,729
>> I just wanted to make sure

268
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,356
you all were alive.

269
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,403
Cool!

270
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,780
I love it!

271
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:51,989
Oh, how cool is this?

272
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,449
You guys have worked your tails

273
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,742
off.

274
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,535
>> Debbie caught us.

275
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,079
Luckily, Sierra had the idea of

276
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:58,829
saying that we're building a

277
00:08:58,913 --> 00:08:59,789
fire pit, which I thought that

278
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,540
was really smart.

279
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,124
Uh, and just kind of went with

280
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,042
it.

281
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:03,668
>> This is so cool.

282
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,543
This will be fun.

283
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,211
>> It'll be good, right?

284
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:05,711
>> Yeah!

285
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:06,671
We can pretend we're at the

286
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:07,838
beach somewhere.

287
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:08,881
>> Debbie's so fun-loving.

288
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,549
She was all about it.

289
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,050
I mean, she was our best

290
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:11,759
salesperson.

291
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,595
>> Wait till you see what

292
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,930
Brendan and Sierra built.

293
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,723
A massive fire pit for a

294
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,100
big beach fire tonight.

295
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:19,725
>> Really?

296
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,018
>> I just don't think it makes

297
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:21,686
that much sense.

298
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,188
I probably won't go, you know.

299
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:24,814
I'd rather sit around here and

300
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,649
talk crap.

301
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,901
>> All right.

302
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,444
>> We were so close to getting

303
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,362
caught.

304
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,655
It may be a stupid move, but to

305
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,739
tell you the truth, I don't

306
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,032
think it worth it to continue

307
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,492
looking for the hidden

308
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:38,327
immunity idol, even though I

309
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,371
know where I stand in this camp

310
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:40,913
with these people, and I'm

311
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:41,664
really worried about my

312
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,791
position.

313
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,266
>> Are you hungry?

314
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,440
>> I was thinking I really want

315
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,692
to steam, like, big, like, sea

316
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,736
bass with, like, some olive oil

317
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,946
and fresh lime juice and wrap it

318
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,406
up in aluminum foil and just let

319
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,532
it steam.

320
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,077
Are you serious?

321
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,370
(laughs)

322
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,081
>> Are we going to do rice

323
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,292
at the same time?

324
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,129
>> That's fine with me.

325
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,380
>> The problem with that though

326
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,631
is with the beans, you got to

327
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,716
have them in water.

328
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,717
What happens with the rice is

329
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,885
that the rice soaks it all up,

330
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:36,427
and I'm afraid you're gonna

331
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,219
burn stuff.

332
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,471
>> You can just add water as

333
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:38,804
you go.

334
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:39,639
>> Think it's gonna be

335
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:40,514
undercooked or it's gonna be

336
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,140
overcooked.

337
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,433
>> Do you want to cook?

338
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,476
I'm gonna tell you right now.

339
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,310
It's either gonna be under-

340
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:44,685
or overcooked.

341
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,227
>> You know what, we've been

342
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:45,770
waiting three days to eat.

343
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,980
If I wait 20 more minutes for

344
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,190
rice to get cooked, it doesn't

345
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:49,690
matter to me.

346
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:50,691
But you're the one doing the

347
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:51,233
cooking, so...

348
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,026
>> I'm just telling you it's

349
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:52,485
not gonna be perfect.

350
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,569
>> You want to put everything

351
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:54,320
in the same pot.

352
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,946
So you guys want to do that,

353
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,906
no problem.

354
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,491
Candace, she has a personality

355
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:58,741
like mine.

356
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,951
She looks to find faults in

357
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:01,619
other people.

358
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:02,244
I do it because I'm-I'm a coach,

359
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,788
and I do it because that's my

360
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:04,205
job.

361
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,331
And I think that maybe she just

362
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,082
does it 'cause that's her

363
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,124
nature.

364
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,167
>> You're taking out, um, I

365
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:08,793
think, some frustration...

366
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:09,794
>> No,<i> you're</i> taking out

367
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:10,294
frustration.

368
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,670
You asked my opinion about the

369
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,046
rice and beans.

370
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,589
That's what I think.

371
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,300
>> I am an educated woman, and I

372
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,885
don't take crap from people.

373
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,345
And Coach comes over feeling

374
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:19,887
like he's the expert.

375
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,431
In real life, like, I would have

376
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:22,973
broke it down, like, to his

377
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,267
psyche, you know, and his

378
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,936
insecurities and how he

379
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,354
overcompensates.

380
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,563
I would've... I would've really,

381
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,023
like, got to him.

382
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,900
But here, I walked away, took a

383
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,569
breath, worked on something

384
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,112
else because I knew he was

385
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,863
gonna feel insecure and want to

386
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:38,989
apologize because he was wrong.

387
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,533
>> I don't want to fight with

388
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:40,908
you.

389
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,535
>> I don't want to fight with

390
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:42,743
you.

391
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,744
>> I just want to kiss you...

392
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,829
>> Stop. See? You're so full of

393
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:45,621
it.

394
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:46,372
>> No, listen...

395
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,456
>> Seriously, I don't even know

396
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,082
if you're being serious.

397
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:48,833
>> I am being serious.

398
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,084
>> You agreed that you took it

399
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:50,334
out on me.

400
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:50,918
>> And I apologize, and you

401
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,878
apologize for coming at me a

402
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:53,671
little bit strong.

403
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:54,839
>> (laughs): I did not even come

404
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:55,172
at you strong.

405
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,425
I was just keeping it real.

406
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,468
>> A little... a little...

407
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,761
>> You can kiss right here.

408
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,721
Okay, that's good.

409
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,432
That man's got a ego bigger than

410
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,975
Brazil.

411
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,601
That will be the death of him,

412
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,728
is his ego.

413
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,904
>> Everywhere is smutty.

414
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,239
>> We can't stay clean over

415
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:20,948
here.

416
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,741
Y'all, seriously, I don't look

417
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:23,325
this rough normally.

418
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:23,909
When I clean up I'm so cute.

419
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:24,994
I promise you.

420
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,037
My husband will tell you...

421
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,165
>> What's your husband do?

422
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:33,169
>> Oh, really?

423
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,295
>> He-he gets all the

424
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,337
information and stuff.

425
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,380
>> Is he college or...?

426
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,048
>> College and NFL.

427
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:38,966
>> Nice. Eddie...? Last name?

428
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,009
What's your last name?

429
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,886
>> George.

430
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,762
>> Eddie George?

431
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:44,847
>> You're married to Eddie

432
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,556
George?

433
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,432
>> Mm-hmm.

434
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,516
>> The Ohio State Buckeye

435
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,225
Heisman Trophy winner?

436
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,143
>> Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

437
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,102
>> That's your husband?

438
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:50,352
>> Mm-hmm.

439
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:50,853
>> Are you serious?

440
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:51,854
>> I'm so serious.

441
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,315
>> I...

442
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:54,899
>> (laughs)

443
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,400
>> Oh, my God.

444
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,110
>> Eddie George is a former NFL

445
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:58,652
running back.

446
00:12:58,736 --> 00:12:59,987
He retired a few years ago from

447
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:00,196
the NFL.

448
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,490
And he also won the Heisman

449
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,492
Trophy back in college.

450
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,826
Uh, it's a pretty neat deal to

451
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,536
be on a tribe in<i> Survivor</i> with,

452
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,954
uh, Eddie George's wife.

453
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,247
Eddie George is not your

454
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:10,498
husband.

455
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,999
>> He's my husband.

456
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,751
(laughs)

457
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,420
>> I absolutely have no idea who

458
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,379
Eddie George is.

459
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,173
So while everybody around me is

460
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,383
freaking out, I'm feeling like

461
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,718
an absolute idiot.

462
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,054
>> You just changed your<i> whole</i>

463
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,014
perspective to everybody.

464
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,182
>> I've got a completely

465
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,642
different outlook on Taj.

466
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,101
Her husband's a very famous

467
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,686
football player.

468
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,021
So, you know, she's probably got

469
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,564
a lot more money than I do.

470
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,190
>> I hate to judge anybody by

471
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,150
how much money they have, but I

472
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,235
know I definitely need the

473
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,277
million dollars more than Taj

474
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,029
does.

475
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:52,039
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

476
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,082
Timbira getting your first look

477
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,043
at the new Jalapao Tribe.

478
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,836
Carolina voted out at the first

479
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,880
Tribal Council.

480
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,716
You guys ready to get to today's

481
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,342
challenge?

482
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,051
>> Yeah.

483
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:04,760
>> Absolutely.

484
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:05,636
>> Oh, yeah.

485
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,679
>> PROBST: As the rain comes

486
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:07,930
down to welcome us.

487
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:08,931
First things first.

488
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,975
Jerry, I will take back

489
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,352
immunity.

490
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,479
Thank you.

491
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:18,983
Once again, immunity is back up

492
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,110
for grabs.

493
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,445
For today's challenge, three

494
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,239
members of each tribe will race

495
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,699
through the water to grab a

496
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:27,533
ball.

497
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,118
You'll then work together until

498
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,536
you can shoot the ball into your

499
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,037
basket, while members of the

500
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,122
other tribe attempt to stop you

501
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,458
any way they can.

502
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,793
The matchups will be determined

503
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:39,044
randomly, with an equal number

504
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,380
of men and women in each round.

505
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,798
First tribe to score three

506
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:45,509
baskets wins immunity and

507
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,011
something else.

508
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,262
>> Come on, baby, come on.

509
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,221
>> PROBST: I know you're hungry.

510
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,765
This should help: fishing gear.

511
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,142
Everything you need: spear, two

512
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,977
poles; you got line, tackle

513
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,937
box, a mask, knife.

514
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,189
This should change things back

515
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,524
at camp significantly.

516
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,317
>> Oh, yeah.

517
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:01,984
>> Big-time.

518
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:02,526
>> PROBST: In addition, the

519
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,612
winning tribe will send one

520
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,113
member from the losing tribe

521
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,157
to Exile Island.

522
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,075
Good news: waiting for you on

523
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,369
Exile, the clue to the location

524
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,704
of a hidden immunity idol.

525
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,247
And there is a twist to Exile,

526
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,957
which I will read after the

527
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,542
challenge.

528
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,627
A lot at stake.

529
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,377
Worth playing for?

530
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,337
>> OTHERS: Yeah!

531
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,671
>> PROBST: Timbira, you have one

532
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,047
extra member.

533
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,423
Who are you gonna sit out?

534
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,090
>> I'll sit out.

535
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,342
>> Debra, you'll take a spot on

536
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:26,592
the bench.

537
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,218
Everybody else, I'll give you

538
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,511
a minute to strategize.

539
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,054
We'll get started.

540
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:30,929
>> Come on.

541
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:34,183
(thunder crashing)

542
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,059
>> PROBST: All right, first

543
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:38,812
round, Taj, Stephen, and Sydney

544
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,731
for Jalapao taking on Sierra,

545
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:44,068
Candace, and Tyson for Timbira.

546
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:48,322
Here we go.

547
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:51,992
Go!

548
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:52,284
>> (yelling)

549
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,620
>> PROBST: Stephen quickly out

550
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,789
for Jalapao.

551
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,123
Taj trying to block out Tyson.

552
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,793
Tyson takes down Stephen and

553
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,086
passes off to Taj.

554
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:06,548
A wild shot!

555
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,300
(indistinct shouting)

556
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,052
Tyson has it for Timbira, over

557
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,054
to Sierra.

558
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,889
Sierra and Taj are fighting for

559
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:15,432
it now.

560
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,101
Stephen getting in on it.

561
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,436
Taj comes up with it for

562
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,020
Jalapao.

563
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,857
Candace intercepts for Timbira.

564
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:24,900
Timbira scores!

565
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:26,402
>> Whoo! All right!

566
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,112
>> PROBST: Timbira leads

567
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:28,362

>> (shouts indistinctly)

569
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:30,739
>> PROBST: All right, next

570
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,158

and stuff like that, so

764
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,136
we're looking forward to

765
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:08,762
spending our day without Tribal

766
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,680
Council going to try to find

767
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,723
some fish.

768
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,558
We need a physical challenge

769
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,644
like that.

770
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,728
>> To be the winning tribe

771
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,897
feels phenomenal.

772
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,607
If we lost immunity, there was

773
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,234
probably a 50% chance of me

774
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,235
going home.

775
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,237
But we won, and I'm here for

776
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,616
another several more days.

777
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,618
>> A net-- a cast net.

778
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:32,577
>> Just ease out here about

779
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,203
waist deep.

780
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:33,787
We have to figure out how to

781
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,664
throw it so it spreads out when

782
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,124
it hits and you can catch bait

783
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,209
fish that way.

784
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,419
>> J.T. has definitely emerged

785
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,462
as our tribe leader and

786
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,839
honestly, I'm thrilled to be out

787
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,132
here with him.

788
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,133
He's like no one I would

789
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:46,675
have met back at home and I

790
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,718
think we're getting to know each

791
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:49,469
other, which I thought is sort

792
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,389
of surprising because he's the

793
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,557
Alabama country boy.

794
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,476
He is Tom Sawyer, and I am the

795
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,769
angsty city boy.

796
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:58,478
He might just be seducing me

797
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,480
with his pretty country ways,

798
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,649
but I'm smitten.

799
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,569
>> You take the loose end...

800
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:06,695
>> Yeah.

801
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,572
>> You go back through that

802
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,490
hole and back through that hole

803
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,701
you just created.

804
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:13,869
>> I see.

805
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,036
>> What you'll do is just hold

806
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,538
it until you feel them, and

807
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,664
then just snatch it.

808
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:18,623
Stephen and I come from

809
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,250
different walks of life.

810
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,501
He's definitely a city boy and

811
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,003
I'm an south Alabama cattle

812
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:23,962
farmer.

813
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:24,963
But we get along really well.

814
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,214
So we have a good friendship.

815
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,215
>> I'm going to become the

816
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,175
greatest spear fisherman that

817
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,302
ever existed.

818
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:42,689
Oh, my God!

819
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,608
They're right here.

820
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,026
There was, like, four or five

821
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,195
of them.

822
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,487
We had some luck in seeing fish.

823
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,655
Not so much in catching the

824
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,948
fish, but I think the fishing

825
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,491
trip was successful in

826
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,076
cementing my and J.T.'s

827
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,286
friendship.

828
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,537
And I know that it makes me look

829
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,331
like his goofy, awkward,

830
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,582
right-hand man.

831
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,583
But if he thinks I'm the goofy,

832
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,418
awkward right-hand man, he's

833
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:04,044
going to want to keep me around

834
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,795
longer.

835
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,606
There's something inside here.

836
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,025
>> When Jalapao tribe picked me

837
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:27,651
to go to Exile, I was totally

838
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:28,860
psyched.

839
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:29,986
I wanted the chance to get the

840
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,862
immunity idol.

841
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,864
Rice, awesome.

842
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,783
And also to come to Exile with

843
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:35,784
somebody from the other tribe

844
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:36,993
is a great opportunity to learn

845
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,120
some information.

846
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,918
>> "You must each choose an

847
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:45,710
urn."

848
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,629
>> You go first.

849
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,172
>> All right.

850
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:49,798
Once Brendan and I made it to

851
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,008
Exile Island, we found two

852
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,927
urns, and there was a message

853
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,887
that we both had to choose one.

854
00:25:58,556 --> 00:25:58,974
There's nothing in mine.

855
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,685
>> Uh-oh.

856
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:04,145
"Open in private."

857
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,480
>> Oh, crap!

858
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:06,815
>> Can you give me a moment?

859
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,316
>> Take a second.

860
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,443
We only have two cups.

861
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:12,737
>> "Congratulations.

862
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,364
You now have the clue to hidden

863
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:14,864
immunity idol.

864
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:15,865
It's up to you whether you

865
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:16,449
share this information with

866
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,867
anyone else."

867
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,080
I opened up my cup and it had

868
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,873
two notes in it.

869
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,583
The first note was the first

870
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,669
clue to find the immunity idol.

871
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:28,628
"If you want to be safe, snoop

872
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,923
around, take a peek, but in

873
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,174
tribal homelands is the thing

874
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:33,675
that you seek."

875
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,928
The tribal homelands?

876
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,430
I kind of look at this as an

877
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:39,347
awesome thing to get sent to

878
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,807
Exile this early in the game.

879
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,933
I just have to figure out where

880
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,351
the tribal homelands are.

881
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,436
"Also you have a choice before

882
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,353
you.

883
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,187
At the end of your stay at

884
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,230
Exile, you can return to the

885
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,523
tribe you just left or you

886
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,483
can join the other tribe.

887
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:50,984
This is a big decision.

888
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:51,860
It has potential to turn this

889
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,737
game on its head."

890
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,071
That it does.

891
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:55,822
The second note was saying that

892
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,866
I had the ability to switch

893
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:58,616
tribes.

894
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,200
No chance, no chance I'll go

895
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,827
to Jalapao.

896
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:04,331
Let me see it. I just want to

897
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,458
see what it looks like.

898
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,919
...with writing on it.

899
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:10,754
I'm gonna go take a walk,

900
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:11,796
though.

901
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,380
>> Do you want me to help you

902
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,423
find it?

903
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:13,923
It's yours.

904
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:14,799
>> You can walk with me, yeah.

905
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:15,383
>> Yeah, I don't want to sit

906
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,010
here by myself.

907
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,136
I'm working Brendan to give

908
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,304
myself a chance to find the

909
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:20,597
idol.

910
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,514
So I'm like trying to be real

911
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,390
nice.

912
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,308
I'm playing up the friendly

913
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:23,892
aspect because when my tribe

914
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,894
found out who my husband

915
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:26,770
actually is-- Eddie George from

916
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,772
the NFL-- I could just tell

917
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:29,272
that they were thinking,

918
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,440
"Well, she doesn't need this.

919
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:30,774
We need it."

920
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:31,358
Everybody thinks they have a

921
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,067
great cause.

922
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,193
Hell, my cause is I want it and

923
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,235
I'm going to stay here and get

924
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,363
it.

925
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,289
"If you want to be safe, snoop

926
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,791
around, take a peek, but in the

927
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,542
tribal homelands is the thing

928
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:52,170
that you seek."

929
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,214
>> Does that make any sense?

930
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,590
>> I think our homelands are

931
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:55,924
where we live.

932
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,676
>> Oh, you're right.

933
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,095
At that point, when I realized

934
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,429
the idol was somewhere back at

935
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,890
the tribe camps, I was thinking

936
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:04,891
there's two hidden immunity

937
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:05,809
idols.

938
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:06,851
There's one in our camp, and

939
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,311
one in Jalapao's camp, and it's

940
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,105
not the same idol that Sierra

941
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,773
was looking for.

942
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:12,399
Do you have, like, a buddy on

943
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,691
your team?

944
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,317
>> I haven't really bonded with

945
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,610
anyone yet.

946
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:16,069
So we have to bond.

947
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,613
>> Seriously, I'm all for that.

948
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:19,030
>> We have to bond.

949
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:19,906
>> So when you go back, will you

950
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:20,907
tell other people it's in your

951
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,867
homeland?

952
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,619
>> Probably not.

953
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:25,662
See, I'm thinking I need to save

954
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:26,871
myself from my tribe.

955
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:27,122
>> Yeah.

956
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:27,956
I'm an entrepreneur, and

957
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,041
having your own business, you

958
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,418
have to make people understand

959
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,794
who you are and make them feel

960
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,003
that, you know what, we can

961
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,046
work together.

962
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,131
And Taj and I created a great

963
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,633
bond that could be very helpful

964
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:39,217
for both of us if we do get to

965
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:39,843
the merge.

966
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,970
So if we do rendezvous later in

967
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,430
the game, I think we will have

968
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,931
a relationship in place.

969
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:45,849
The goal is that we both get to

970
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,435
get sent back here.

971
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,561
>> That's perfect.

972
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:50,186
>> Hopefully, that will give us

973
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:50,812
the next clue where it is in

974
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,647
our homeland.

975
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,189
So we need to work together.

976
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:53,857
>> Yeah.

977
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,358
>> Does that work?

978
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,067
>> That works for me.

979
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:56,526
We're going to try it.

980
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:56,860
>> That works?

981
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,945
>> Oh, yeah.

982
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,994
>> You guys, this is really

983
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,245
good.

984
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,079
>> You got a big chunk out of

985
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,497
your elbow right there.

986
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,206
>> That's where that young kid

987
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:10,874
tackled me, man.

988
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,542
>> I am shocked at that little

989
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:13,710
old lady.

990
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,086
>> Yeah, they almost drowned me

991
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,088
at one point.

992
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,131
>> It was a very tough

993
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,174
challenge, and it got really

994
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,383
physical.

995
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,885
So when we lost, I was very

996
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,761
disappointed.

997
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:24,804
I hate to lose because

998
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:28,475
somebody is going home.

999
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,059
>> Honestly, I didn't see Coach

1000
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,644
playing that hard.

1001
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,438
He barely tackled anyone.

1002
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,231
He didn't fight to get free.

1003
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,775
We need action, not words.

1004
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,027
>> I feel like I'm dealing with

1005
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,236
one of the, like, church women

1006
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,654
at my church that go every

1007
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,156
Sunday and wear these hats,

1008
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,283
but they ain't on the up-and-up.

1009
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,701
That's what I feel like, you

1010
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:47,911
know.

1011
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:51,039
Coach is not excelling

1012
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,707
physically in the way that

1013
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,334
I thought he would.

1014
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,001
And at the end of the day, I

1015
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,920
really don't see, like, what

1016
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:59,005
all Coach is bringing to the

1017
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,965
table except a lot of talk.

1018
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,771
>> You know what I mean,

1019
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:15,230
big-time right now.

1020
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,022
I don't know.

1021
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,358
I just... I don't like to be

1022
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,734
around negativity, and if we've

1023
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:20,276
got negative going on in the

1024
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,903
group, it's going to be

1025
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,321
really tough for me.

1026
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,239
>> This kind of stuff that

1027
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,281
you're telling me makes me

1028
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:28,243
worried because who would go?

1029
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,911
>> I thought earlier we'd all

1030
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,329
decided Sierra.

1031
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,580
>> Yeah, I know, but what I'm

1032
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,499
thinking is this: I do want

1033
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:35,708
the strong people to be here,

1034
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:36,292
but I mean the poisoned apple

1035
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:36,918
needs to go because it's going

1036
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,962
to ruin the bunch.

1037
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,797
At first I thought I'm going

1038
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,339
with the plan and vote for

1039
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,383
Sierra, and now Candace is...

1040
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,426
boy, talk about cancer on the

1041
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,553
team.

1042
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,054
Just the negative attitude, I

1043
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,180
think everybody's pretty much

1044
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,181
fed up with it.

1045
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,683
And, you know, sometimes there

1046
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,477
is addition by subtraction.

1047
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,020
She got on me.

1048
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,647
She's going to get on everybody.

1049
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,190
The cancer will ruin the tribe.

1050
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,872
>> Oh, man, my man!

1051
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:15,707
>> Hey!

1052
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,749
>> All right!

1053
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,585
>> Oh, my God.

1054
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:19,502
>> How you doing, man?

1055
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:20,169
>> Good.

1056
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,462
>> What's going on, big guy?

1057
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,338
>> Have you eaten anything?

1058
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,256
>> Yeah, we had rice.

1059
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,007
We got a fire.

1060
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:24,424
We slept outside.

1061
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,133
And it's just this giant dune

1062
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:25,925
that comes out of the middle of

1063
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,635
nowhere.

1064
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,803
>> So how did you both look for

1065
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:30,555
the idol at the same time?

1066
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,431
>> There's two urns...

1067
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:32,056
>> Uh-huh.

1068
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,391
>> You each get to pick an urn,

1069
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:34,559
and mine was empty and hers

1070
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,269
had a clue.

1071
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,270
And I was setting up camp.

1072
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,896
She went back up, came back

1073
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,856
down, but she never really said

1074
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:40,315
if she got it or not.

1075
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,816
>> You didn't charm the

1076
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:42,442
clue out of her?

1077
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:43,776
>> I don't know; she is clearly

1078
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,944
on the outs with her tribe.

1079
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:45,695
>> Really?

1080
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:46,487
>> You think?

1081
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,071
>> Yeah, that's what she said.

1082
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,616
The idol is actually under

1083
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,909
everybody's nose in camp.

1084
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:52,535
I don't want to let that out of

1085
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,911
the bag yet.

1086
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,747
It's one very general clue,

1087
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,832
and that's too broad.

1088
00:31:57,915 --> 00:31:58,374
So you know, I'll be patient

1089
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,710
and just hope the clues keep

1090
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,920
falling into my lap.

1091
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,385
>> Who's that somebody going to

1092
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,721
be?

1093
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,767
>> Oh, yeah.

1094
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,101
Like, he's a big guy, and he

1095
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,311
looks like he's in good shape,

1096
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,771
but I just haven't seen it yet.

1097
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,147
>> But, I mean, I don't know

1098
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,482
how soon we can do it.

1099
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,525
I don't know if this Council,

1100
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:24,984
it might be too soon.

1101
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,027
>> Yeah.

1102
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,112
>> I think if we just stay

1103
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,739
chilled and let him keep

1104
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,157
digging his hole.

1105
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,450
>> Yeah.

1106
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,618
>> So then the sad part is

1107
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:34,410
somebody has to go.

1108
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,537
>> Yeah.

1109
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:39,290
>> Everyone has their strengths

1110
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,459
and their weaknesses.

1111
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:42,835
We just need to do what makes

1112
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:43,211
the team stronger.

1113
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:46,881
>> You're right about that.

1114
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:49,300
>> What do you think, Coach?

1115
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,725
>> The original plan when we

1116
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,935
walked into camp was to go with

1117
00:32:59,018 --> 00:32:59,477
Sierra.

1118
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,311
>> Okay, got it.

1119
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,437
I didn't know how original

1120
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:01,813
we were talking.

1121
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:02,313
I'm like, wait a minute.

1122
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:06,359
Is there a new original plan?

1123
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,276
>> We're going to Tribal

1124
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,611
Council.

1125
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,487
And the girls think

1126
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,530
that everybody is voting for

1127
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,906
Sierra, but for me, the obvious

1128
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:12,573
choice is Candace.

1129
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,741
She's just a cancer on the

1130
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,743
tribe.

1131
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,285
I've been looking forward to

1132
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,495
this elimination.

1133
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:18,287
I think it's good.

1134
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,706
I think it's what we need.

1135
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:20,748
So hopefully, Candace has her

1136
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,583
bags packed because she's out of

1137
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,670
here.

1138
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,679
>> How about you?

1139
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:35,555
>> Yeah, that...

1140
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,682
She crossed my mind.

1141
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,892
Sierra was on my mind at first.

1142
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,771
>> Coach, he wants to get rid

1143
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:44,439
of Candace.

1144
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,773
You know, I didn't necessarily

1145
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:46,482
think he was right.

1146
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,735
In the challenge yesterday, as

1147
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,737
hard as Sierra played, I think

1148
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,238
that she's just too small for

1149
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,573
something like that.

1150
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,907
Every time I saw her, she was

1151
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,367
trying her hardest, but

1152
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,035
somebody was holding her down.

1153
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,163
So I think there's going to be

1154
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,247
some challenges that probably

1155
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,373
would suit Candace better than

1156
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,750
they would Sierra.

1157
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,585
We need to keep the strongest,

1158
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,169
happiest tribe we can.

1159
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,296
>> Yeah.

1160
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,218
>> I will not vote you off

1161
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,136
tonight.

1162
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,889
>> I feel like it's my time,

1163
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,056
it's my time.

1164
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:19,724
>> I'm going to tell you

1165
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:19,974
something.

1166
00:34:20,057 --> 00:34:21,768
I make my living off of people

1167
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,978
trusting me.

1168
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,649
So you just have to be cool

1169
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,609
and relax.

1170
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,486
>> Coach told me I wasn't going

1171
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,946
to get voted out, but I know

1172
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,531
that my whole tribe, from the

1173
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,033
beginning, wanted to vote me

1174
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,659
off, so I'm freaking out a

1175
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:39,660
little bit about that.

1176
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,078
>> Stop worrying.

1177
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:41,788
>> I'm not worrying.

1178
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:42,413
>> You are worrying.

1179
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:42,914
You can't say you're not

1180
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:43,581
worrying.

1181
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,083
I know you're worrying.

1182
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,460
>> I am not comfortable at all.

1183
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,128
I still have not found the

1184
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:49,587
hidden immunity idol.

1185
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:53,382
So, I'm still looking behind my

1186
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,510
back.

1187
00:34:59,388 --> 00:34:59,847
>> That's a long time for

1188
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,224
people to be rallying.

1189
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,184
>> Mm-hmm.

1190
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:06,896
>> I don't know.

1191
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:09,190
>> Okay, let's think about this.

1192
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,691
You and I are both strong.

1193
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,317
>> Yeah.

1194
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,276
>> The guys have been talking

1195
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,694
about voting Sierra off for

1196
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:14,320
days.

1197
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:17,782
>> Okay, I worry about the fact

1198
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:18,825
that, like, if anybody strays a

1199
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:19,951
little bit, like...

1200
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:20,743
>> Listen, I'm going to tell you

1201
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,452
right now.

1202
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:22,703
It ain't you or me.

1203
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,498
They know what we're worth.

1204
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,834
As far as I know, it's Sierra

1205
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:28,876
going home.

1206
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,336
And if it's not, then there's

1207
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,255
mad shadiness going on around

1208
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:36,968
this tribe.

1209
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,262
>> Yeah.

1210
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,304
>> Everybody trying to figure

1211
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,348
it out.

1212
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,558
>> And this is just the

1213
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,183
beginning.

1214
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,310
>> I know it.

1215
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,290
>> PROBST: Behind each of you

1216
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:07,832
is a torch.

1217
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:08,916
Go ahead and grab a torch.

1218
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,793
Approach the flame, dip it in,

1219
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:14,505
and get fire.

1220
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,923
This is part of the ritual of

1221
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,091
Tribal Council because, in this

1222
00:36:17,174 --> 00:36:18,384
game, fire represents your life.

1223
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,344
As long as you have fire,

1224
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,262
you're still in the game.

1225
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,388
When your fire's gone, so are

1226
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:25,016
you.

1227
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,267
Let's go back to the very

1228
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:26,517
beginning.

1229
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,145
Sierra, based on very little

1230
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,730
information, you were voted out

1231
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:31,522
of this tribe.

1232
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,773
What was going through your

1233
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,108
mind at that moment?

1234
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,110
>> Um, a part of me wanted to

1235
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:37,236
give up for a second.

1236
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,113
It was written all over my face

1237
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:40,573
that I was sick, so I

1238
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:41,991
automatically looked weak from

1239
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:42,950
the get-go.

1240
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,410
So I think their vote was valid.

1241
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:45,953
>> PROBST: Tyson, what was your

1242
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,121
reaction to Sierra?

1243
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:48,873
>> She kind of looked miserable

1244
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:49,457
on the truck.

1245
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,291
I didn't see her pull

1246
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,208
anything off.

1247
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,084
I didn't see her gather very

1248
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:52,501
much.

1249
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,419
She seemed to be struggling in

1250
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,296
the heat and didn't seem very

1251
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,339
happy, so...

1252
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:57,465
>> PROBST: Candace, how much

1253
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,342
time was spent talking about

1254
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,135
Sierra and why everybody voted

1255
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:01,761
for her?

1256
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:02,887
>> Honestly, there was a little

1257
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,221
bit of resentment because it was

1258
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,015
such a difficult trek and she

1259
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:08,017
was taking a helicopter ride.

1260
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,144
And I think she really wasn't

1261
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,646
that excited to be here or

1262
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,230
wanted to be here as much as

1263
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:13,564
everyone else.

1264
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,899
>> PROBST: And what do you

1265
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:16,150
think the vibe is on you,

1266
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:16,484
overall?

1267
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,778
>> I think I'm vibing with the

1268
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,071
group, but it's like, you never

1269
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:20,571
know.

1270
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,031
I mean, sometimes I talk a

1271
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,324
lot, and maybe that might be

1272
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,450
misinterpreted.

1273
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,368
We're all different.

1274
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,244
It's hard to tell.

1275
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,329
>> PROBST: Coach, do you think

1276
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,705
anybody would tell you this

1277
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:30,706
early in the game if you didn't

1278
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,499
mesh?

1279
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,084
>> At this point, you got to

1280
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:33,584
go with your intuition.

1281
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,336
And if you're clashing with

1282
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,671
somebody, you've got to sense

1283
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:37,380
that on your own because I guess

1284
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:38,422
at this stage, nobody is going

1285
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,050
to tell you that.

1286
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:41,842
>> PROBST: Let's talk a little

1287
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,094
about Exile Island.

1288
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,595
Brendan, how was Exile?

1289
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,513
>> Um, it wasn't exactly

1290
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,057
luxurious by any means, but it

1291
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,517
was a cool experience to go

1292
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,351
check out and have a chance to

1293
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,478
kind of go there with Taj and go

1294
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:55,064
through the process of Exile.

1295
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,232
>> PROBST: So, Coach, how

1296
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,984
curious was everybody about

1297
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,193
Brendan's stay on Exile?

1298
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,152
>> Right off the bat, he said

1299
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,487
there were two jars, and one of

1300
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,613
them had a clue to look for the

1301
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:03,948
idol and the other one didn't.

1302
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,282
He didn't get the clue.

1303
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,159
And that's somebody that I

1304
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,828
respect and trust and I believe

1305
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,747
100% when he tells me something.

1306
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:12,665
>> PROBST: Jerry, are you

1307
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,292
surprised how quickly trust is

1308
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,502
a major issue in this game?

1309
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,045
You barely know these people.

1310
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:21,090
>> Jeff, yes, trust is a major

1311
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,174
issue in this game.

1312
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,092
Because if you can win the trust

1313
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,593
of over half the tribe, then

1314
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:25,636
you'll be here for a while.

1315
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,054
But if you can't win the trust,

1316
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:27,638
your time here is going to be

1317
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,181
limited.

1318
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:29,765
>> PROBST: Hard to make a vote

1319
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,142
this early on?

1320
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:31,892
>> It's really hard to make a

1321
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:32,893
vote this early on.

1322
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,062
I've bonded with this group of

1323
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,814
individuals so closely, and

1324
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:37,773
we've got to know each other

1325
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,442
real, I mean, real well.

1326
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:40,317
>> PROBST: Erinn, what are you

1327
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,027
reacting to?

1328
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,237
>> We can talk all day about

1329
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,822
how much we all get along and

1330
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:45,906
this, that and the other thing,

1331
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,949
but we don't know these people.

1332
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,701
We've known them for six days.

1333
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,077
But I don't know if the person

1334
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,328
I've bonded with is who you

1335
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:51,787
really are.

1336
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:52,538
I just think we need to be

1337
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:53,372
careful.

1338
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:53,914
>> I have to disagree with

1339
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:54,999
Erinn.

1340
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,125
We're not at the Holiday Inn.

1341
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,461
We are out there surviving

1342
00:38:58,544 --> 00:38:58,753
together.

1343
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,005
That trek that we went through,

1344
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,089
to me that's how you really get

1345
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,215
to know someone.

1346
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:03,841
>> But I don't know that that's

1347
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,593
how you get to trust someone.

1348
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:06,802
>> Well, I've already built

1349
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:07,470
trust.

1350
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,512
I've built trust with several

1351
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,557
people on this tribe.

1352
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,225
>> PROBST: All right, it is time

1353
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:13,476
to vote.

1354
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,603
Tyson, you're up.

1355
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:40,503
>> You played a great physical

1356
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:43,047
game, but nobody wants a snake

1357
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,174
in the grass.

1358
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,372
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1359
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,666
votes.

1360
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:31,762
>> PROBST: If anybody has the

1361
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:32,972
hidden immunity idol and you

1362
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,306
want to play it, now would be

1363
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,642
the time to do so.

1364
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:39,603
All right.

1365
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:40,104
Once the votes are read,

1366
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:40,688
the decision is final.

1367
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,481
The person voted out will be

1368
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,357
asked to leave the Tribal

1369
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,608
Council area immediately.

1370
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,653
I'll read the votes.

1371
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:51,031
First vote: Candace.

1372
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:55,703
Sierra.

1373
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:56,954
One vote Candace;

1374
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,498
one vote Sierra.

1375
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,584
Candace.

1376
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,878
Two votes Candace;

1377
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,630
one vote Sierra.

1378
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,841
Candace.

1379
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,384
That's three votes Candace;

1380
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:12,511
one vote Sierra.

1381
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,557
Candace.

1382
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,725
Four votes Candace;

1383
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,269
one vote Sierra.

1384
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,107
Second person voted out of

1385
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,775
<i>Survivor: Tocantins:</i> Candace.

1386
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:27,067
That's five.

1387
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,152
That's enough.

1388
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,279
You need to bring me your torch.

1389
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,662
Candace, the tribe has spoken.

1390
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,137
Well, your first Tribal

1391
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,932
Council, your first blindside.

1392
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,350
Congratulations.

1393
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,351
Grab your torches.

1394
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,143
Head back to camp.

1395
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,686
Good night.

The tribes are hit hard.

secret alliance.

1412
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:29,004
>> We would have a four-way

1413
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,548
alliance that nobody knows

1414
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:32,091
about.

1415
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:32,758
>> That nobody knows about.

1416
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:33,050
>> Exactly.

1417
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,593
>> They won't even know what's

1418
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:35,261
coming.

1419
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,388
(laughing)

1420
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,688
>> I'm surprised.

1421
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,356
I'm really pissed off.

1422
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,774
I worked really hard.

1423
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:49,692
I worked in the challenges.

1424
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:50,651
I worked on camp.

1425
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,653
And I did everything I could

1426
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,155
to try to make Timbira stronger.

1427
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,699
And I thought that that was the

1428
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:56,907
goal.

1429
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,034
But I guess this is more like

1430
00:42:59,118 --> 00:42:59,326
day camp.

1431
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,495
In the long run, I was an asset

1432
00:43:01,578 --> 00:43:02,705
and they're going to need me.
