>> PROBST: We're on board the

2
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:17,809
>> PROBST: We're on board the

3
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:20,562
fishing trawler<i> Amaryllis,</i>
making our way through the very

4
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:24,107
rough waters of the South
Pacific.

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,318
Down below, deep inside the hold
of this ship, 16 Americans,

6
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:30,613
about to be abandoned in the
middle of the Marquesas, part of

7
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,950
Tahiti's mystical islands.
Thousands of miles from the

8
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:40,123
nearest continent, this will be
their home for the next 39 days.

9
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:43,460
But this time the game is
different.

10
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:48,423
These survivors will be given no
food, absolutely no rations.

11
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:51,926
Each tribe will leave the ship
with only the barest of

12
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,764
essentials: two machetes, two
cooking pots, two empty water

13
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:59,851
containers, one frying pan, one
filet knife, and one magnifying

14
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,020
glass.
They'll be left to fend for

15
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:05,482
themselves using the resources
of the land and their own

16
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,651
survival skills.
It is the ultimate challenge:

17
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,989
16 strangers forced to work
together to create a new society

18
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:16,034
while battling the elements and
each other.

19
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:19,537
They must learn to adapt or
they'll be voted out of the

20
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,332
tribe.
In the end, only one will remain

21
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:27,003
to claim the million-dollar
prize.

22
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:40,058
39 days, 16 people...
one survivor.

23
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,920
>> PROBST: As this ship drops
anchor, these 16 Americans began

24
00:02:51,004 --> 00:03:02,098
the adventure of a lifetime.
They have never spoken to each

25
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:05,226
other, and have been divided
into the two competing tribes:

26
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:11,941
Maraamu and Rotu, Tahitian words
for "wind" and "rain."

27
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:16,321
Each tribe will be given a crate
which holds a minimal amount of

28
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:20,116
supplies, but no food and no
water.

29
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:24,412
They then face a difficult two-
mile paddle to their beaches and

30
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:31,628
their new homes for the next 39
days.

31
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:37,425
(<i> shouting</i> )
>> Okay!

32
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:47,894
>> Woo!
>> Let's get away from the boat.

33
00:03:47,977 --> 00:04:01,991
>> Over here.
>> PROBST: The Rotu Tribe, which

34
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,662
will always wear blue, consists

always wear yellow, consists of

California.
>> One, two, three, four, five.

55
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:48,056
California.
>> One, two, three, four, five.

56
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,932
>> Guess what.
We haven't moved at all in,

57
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,643
like, the last half hour.
>> We were making zero progress.

58
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,438
I don't know how long we were
out there, but every one of us

59
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,815
were totally exhausted.
>> I think we're going exactly

60
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,277
.2 miles per hour.
>> Okay, don't stop rowing!

61
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,280
>> One...
two...

62
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,449
three...
four.

63
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:10,745
Over to that cliff.
>> Really well, excellent work.

64
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,914
>> Rotu, Rotu.
Rotu, Rotu.

65
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:17,126
>> We were singing and trying to
get some sort of rowing motion,

66
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,629
you know, like on an old whaler
there.

67
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,632
And it really brought us
together.

68
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:29,097
>> ...three... four...
five... six... seven...

69
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:36,270
>> We're getting there.
>> ...six, seven, eight.

70
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,607
Woo!
We made it!

71
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,319
Can you believe it?
>> My first thought when we hit

72
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:46,489
the beach was, "Thank you, God,
for letting us hit this beach."

73
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:50,284
I was just happy to have made
it.

74
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:54,372
>> Everybody was so psyched.
They were just running around

75
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,833
and congratulating each other
and we were thrilled.

76
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,709
We made it.
We made it the first part of

77
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,170
the way.
>> Wonderful to be here, guys.

78
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:10,012
>> So our tribe is Rotu!
(<i> cheering</i> )

79
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,435
>> It was great when we rounded
that final corner.

80
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,855
You know, we had seen a lot of
coves, and we weren't sure if

81
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,357
this was the one.
We thought it was the one, and

82
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,569
then finally to see the flag
coming home-- it was great.

83
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:30,908
(<i> cheering</i> )
Wave the flag!

84
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:40,585
>> As we were coming in, last
maybe 50 yards or so, we all

85
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:47,592
made a concerted effort to give
a last heave to make it to land,

86
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:52,054
and it was quite evident that
Sarah wasn't doing anything at

87
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,725
all.
Stroke, stroke.

88
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:59,896
Kick, kick.
Kick.

89
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:04,066
Stroke, stroke.
>> Sarah's arrival was almost

90
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,737
like Cleopatra.
It was like the servants are

91
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,617
paddling and lifting and she's
sitting on a crate looking so

92
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:18,289
marvelous with her boobs hanging
out and her Goldilocks in the

93
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:24,253
air.
>> Woo-hoo!

94
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,047
>> Save it, you know?
This is<i> Survivor.</i>

95
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,049
Nobody trying to look at you
like that here.

96
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:36,182
>> Home sweet home.
>> Yes!

97
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,319
>> When we first arrived on
land, I can't even describe it.

98
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:52,615
It was beyond words.
First of all, I had never been

99
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,451
on an ocean, ever.
I mean, in the hood, ain't a lot

100
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:59,121
of pools, you know, probably
don't really swim too much.

101
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:03,251
>> How you doing, man?
Are you going to make it?

102
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:06,629
>> It's emotional when I think
about the miracles that God has

103
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,257
performed for me.
We didn't do this on our own.

104
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,426
He definitely... his Hand was
under the raft guiding us.

105
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,389
God, we thank you.
We is in the ocean.

106
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:20,977
And you led us here, God.
>> Sean and Peter immediately

107
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,271
bonded.
They went into the water and

108
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,690
they had their prayer Baptism
revival.

109
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,817
>> We can do all things through
Christ.

110
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,153
>> This told me that either Sean
and Peter were either really

111
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,490
playing the game starting real
early, or they were definitely

112
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:37,451
off their rockers.
>> All these things, we pray,

113
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,872
for your son, Jesus Christ,
Amen.

114
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,336
>> You guys ready to look in the
box?

115
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,173
>> Let's go do the box!
>> Yeah!

116
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:56,178
>> Woo! We got it!
>> Oh, it's not as much as we

117
00:09:56,262 --> 00:10:01,183
thought!
>> Our crate had no food.

118
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:05,688
No food at all.
>> I had no idea that this would

119
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,190
be like this out here.
But I mean, we're here.

120
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,277
We know we have to survive and
it's tough, so we just do

121
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,529
whatever we can.
>> Hey, hey, what's this?

122
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:15,865
>> Hey, hey, hey.
>> All right, what's this?

123
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,701
>> Must be a map.
A water map.

124
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:22,163
>> The stuff that was in the
crate-- we got a map to our

125
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,665
water spot.
We got, like, two pots and a

126
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:28,336
pan, two machetes and a small
knife, and then a magnifying

127
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,754
glass.
>> Woo!

128
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,797
>> Oh, my God.
>> Woo!

129
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,924
>> Let's get going.
Let's build a fire.

130
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,345
>> All right, we need tinder.
>> We were soaking wet and we

131
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:40,931
had a limited amount of daylight
left, so our first thing was to

132
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:52,526
get fire.
>> Keep doing what you're doing.

133
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,404
Good job.
It's working.

134
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,079
>> We landed so late.
The sun was down;

135
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:07,958
the clouds were up.
>> Oh...

136
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,587
>> That's a lot of cloud, too.
>> I mean we tried and tried and

137
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,924
tried, and it just didn't work.
>> This is not going to work.

138
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,009
>> Okay.
>> And Kathy, she's like, "We

139
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,887
have to have fire and we have to
have it right now."

140
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:25,434
So we tried the "two pieces of
wood" method.

141
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,273
>> Yeah, yeah, man!
This is not going to work.

142
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:36,112
>> Okay.
>> Kathy slips very easily into

143
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:40,199
the role of the skipper.
Maybe it's her personality.

144
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,660
Maybe it's the difficulty of
being out here.

145
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,995
I don't know.
But we didn't need a skipper.

146
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,081
>> All right, well, let's just
rotate.

147
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:53,295
All right, I'll be right back.
>> We have been rotating.

148
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,091
>> Keep going. Come on.
Good.

149
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:01,262
Go, Johnny, go.
>> We were plowing, plowing,

150
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,932
plowing and after rolling for
all those hours, our arms were

151
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:09,145
just spent.
>> No.

152
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:14,483
>> So we didn't get fire the
first day, which sucked.

153
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,168
>> I definitely knew this game
was going to be hard when we got

154
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,462
here and there was no food.
There was nothing in the box.

155
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,380
>> What's in there?
We knew that if we didn't work

156
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,632
as a team, one of us was going
to starve to death.

157
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,676
>> What's in this?
>> That's a magnifying glass.

158
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,345
>> If that's a magnifying glass
we got about an hour to collect

159
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,890
some wood and start a fire.
>> Hunter's leadership role

160
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,684
started when we got here.
You know, immediately Hunter

161
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,687
said we needed to, you know,
stake out where we want to put

162
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,690
the fire.
>> Hey, you guys?

163
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,026
We got a magnifying glass, so if
we can collect a ton of

164
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,528
firewood, we have only got about
an hour and a half, two hours

165
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,405
left.
>> I'm already in love with

166
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,032
Hunter.
He's a great person.

167
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,702
We have so much in common.
Hunter knows a little bit about

168
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,871
everything.
>> I think the prevailing wind

169
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,499
is going to probably switch and
come from this direction.

170
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:15,920
>> "The prevailing wind"?
This is the weather station over

171
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,088
here?
>> I know you mean well, but you

172
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,717
sound like, "a little bit of
wind flowing to the east, but in

173
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,553
the morning when we wake up, the
sun will be up."

174
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:28,557
My nickname for Hunter is
MacGyver, simply because he got

175
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,185
way too much energy for me out
here.

176
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:34,396
>> You know what I was thinking?
If we can get some of the banana

177
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,274
leaves, and if it starts to
rain, we have the banana leaf

178
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,068
funnel.
>> You can drink rainwater,

179
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,945
right?
>> Out here he's going to turn

180
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,239
into MacGyver.
Everybody, let's make a funnel

181
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,950
out of a banana plant so in the
morning we can get the

182
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,911
nutrients, because the winds
will be blowing to the east.

183
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,830
>> I see that Hunter is starting
to be a focal point where

184
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,041
everybody is going to check with
him first.

185
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:57,586
I'm a alpha male, too, so I find
it hard to just follow somebody

186
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,589
just blindly and keep going like
they're my daddy.

187
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,425
I'm not going to do that.
They better know, I'm from

188
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:07,263
Harlem and I'm representing.
>> We got 40 minutes and that

189
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:14,270
sun is behind the mountain.
>> Sometimes the angle, the tilt

190
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,605
of the lens.
Tilt it a little bit.

191
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:21,443
Okay.
That's a good one.

192
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,077
>> So I mean, it's so close.
I tried my best for 15 minutes

193
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,955
and actually, we got some smoke.
We got some good smoke.

194
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:37,126
We just couldn't get it
completely going.

195
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:41,422
>> The problem in lighting the
fire is having maintain an air

196
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:44,675
flow to keep it going.
>> Peter, we need you over here.

197
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,928
>> We got to have someone
blowing.

198
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,473
People know that I'm into yoga.
You know, I did that about ten

199
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,810
years ago, and in yoga, you
breathe from the diaphragm, so I

200
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:57,271
was able to take nice, long,
deep breaths.

201
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:04,653
(<i> blowing</i> )
>> Yeah!

202
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,824
>> Come on.
>> Woo-hoo!

203
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:11,702
>> Yoga definitely helps with
lighting the fire.

204
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,329
>> We got fire!
>> Here we go.

205
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,456
>> Keep the fuel up.
Keep the fuel up.

206
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:21,629
Don't let it go out.
>> Let's not let it go out.

207
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:31,680
>> Robert rocks!
(<i> chattering</i> )

208
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:42,524
>> Robert rocks!
(<i> chattering</i> )

209
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,194
>> I want a monkey if I win any
amount of money.

210
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,197
I want a monkey.
You want a monkey too?

211
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,866
>> Yeah.
You want a little curious

212
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:53,827
George?
>> Sarah has a very cute body.

213
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:58,540
She paid a lot for it.
And if you have it, of course

214
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:07,216
flaunt it.
I do not think that Sarah is

215
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,552
using her body to get through
this game, but I do think that

216
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,722
if she connects with the right
individual, then that will

217
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,017
definitely help her get through.
>> I want to go look at the bed.

218
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:21,021
I didn't get to check it out.
>> Who is going to sleep inside

219
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,940
this?
>> I don't got my shoes on.

220
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,901
>> Right on top of it.
>> I thought we were going to

221
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:27,569
sleep in there.
Is it comfy?

222
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,823
>> Oh, yeah, it's like a
waterbed.

223
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,449
>> Oh!
>> You all right?

224
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,369
>> Oh, dude, I can go to sleep
right now.

225
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:38,122
>> Last night there was
definitely flirtation around Rob

226
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,416
and Sarah.
>> We fill this thing up and let

227
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,792
it cook in the sun all day
tomorrow...

228
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,544
>> There you go.
>> We got a hot tub.

229
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,587
>> That's an idea.
>> Yeah, or just a little

230
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,757
swimming pool, or whatever.
>> Get some cocktails, too.

231
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,428
You'll figure out a way.
>> When we got into the raft

232
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:56,306
that we had paddled in on and
they kind of just hung out away

233
00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:00,352
from everybody else, and were
there pretty much the whole darn

234
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,396
night.
So at that point in time, that

235
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,232
was another question" what are
they saying, you know?

236
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,818
Are they flirting or are they
making an alliance?

237
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,821
And you shouldn't put yourself
in that situation if you don't

238
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:20,914
want people to think that.
>> Anybody have any water?

239
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:30,966
want people to think that.
>> Anybody have any water?

240
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:32,968
>> Are these all empty?
>> Yeah.

241
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:34,970
>> Oh, my gosh.
>> That's five.

242
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:37,639
>> When we first landed on the
island we knew we were going to

243
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,309
run out of water in a hurry.
We each had one coconut full of

244
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,437
water, which is about a liter,
and you really need a gallon a

245
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,481
day.
>> Well, if we follow the river

246
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,524
up we get to a little stream
there.

247
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,486
>> That's a good idea.
>> (<i> whistles</i> )

248
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,863
Hey, you guys!
This is the way.

249
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:56,825
I found the way.
I did not want to go into this

250
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:01,789
being the blond bitchy person at
all 'cause I'm really not.

251
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:05,793
The only time I do get assertive
is when I see that a critical

252
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:16,345
job isn't getting done.
Is that primeval or what?

253
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,890
It's incredible.
>> There's a waterfall!

254
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,683
>> Are you kidding me?
Woo!

255
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:25,020
Start swimming, baby.
>> Go, go, go.

256
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:28,148
>> We were so excited when we
found that waterfall, like, I

257
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,151
saw it for the first time and I
could not believe my eyes.

258
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,862
>> Oh, my God!
>> Woo!

259
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:39,159
>> Come on, guys!
>> I was like, this is awesome!

260
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:45,040
>> You tell me there's not a
god.

261
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:55,425
>> I don't want to go home.
>> That waterfall was just, ah,

262
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,595
it was like sanctuary.
Damn, I think it's taro.

263
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,057
We found a ton of taro, so we
got food; we got water.

264
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:06,186
These surroundings will give you
everything, so you've gotta be

265
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,523
close to Mother Earth now.
If you never were before, now's

266
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:12,526
the time.
>> Now that we found this

267
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,404
waterfall, it's dynamite, and
then it's just the fire, that

268
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,531
damn fire.
So I'm just going to work on the

269
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,075
fire when we get back.
I'm going to work on it until

270
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:28,417
it's dark.
>> Stop.

271
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,543
>> Oh, there it goes.
Oh, sweet!

272
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,879
>> This is grapefruit, right?
It smells like grapefruit.

273
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,423
When we open it up we can tell
because we'll know what it looks

274
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:45,767
like.
>> Everybody, a toast.

275
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,812
Cheers!
To Maraamu.

276
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:52,900
>> Maraamu!
>> When I first arrived here I

277
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:57,237
realized that we had no food at
all, and I didn't want to be

278
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:01,783
eating lemons and grapefruits
the entire time we're here.

279
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,953
(<i> rooster crowing</i> )
Did you hear that?

280
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,414
Listen, can you hear that
gobbling?

281
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,625
Sounds like a turkey.
Do you hear it?

282
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:13,003
I'm being dead serious.
I don't know if chickens make

283
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:16,506
that sound too.
So I decided that I would try to

284
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,094
get some meat for us.
There are chickens and pigs in

285
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,972
this area.
Yo, yo, yo, don't move.

286
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,976
There's a chicken.
I swear to God.

287
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,829
He's got to come down, right?
He's right up there.

288
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,791
>> That thing is huge!
>> Dude, that is dinner right

289
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,709
there.
Come on, we've got to get him

290
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:56,630
down.
I'll grab him and just snap him.

291
00:20:56,713 --> 00:21:06,139
Roosters can't fly, can they?
>> I had no idea that roosters

292
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:09,559
can fly.
But this rooster took off like a

293
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,645
747.
He was out of there.

294
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:15,148
And that was it.
>> Did you get him?

295
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,234
Come on, chicken man.
Did you get him?

296
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,527
>> No.
I know.

297
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,030
I will.
>> At times Rob is a little

298
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,908
preoccupied with things that
don't really pertain to the

299
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,536
survival needs of the moment.
He wants to chase chickens, I

300
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,705
mean, I don't even think he
knows how to clean a chicken.

301
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:33,583
>> Maybe I don't have as much
experience as you guys do with

302
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,420
what needs to be done.
>> That's why I was getting a

303
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,381
little frustrated because if we
collect a lot of firewood, if we

304
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,050
get the water going, if we
finish the shelter, once we've

305
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,386
got all those things, then we do
the luxury items.

306
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:48,056
>> Hunter felt that I was
spending too much time trying to

307
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,935
hunt down meat and I needed to
be around helping with the daily

308
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,897
chores.
One down.

309
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,067
I realized that I'm going to
have to work hard...

310
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,903
Two down.
...to stay in the group now, and

311
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,198
that this is essentially going
to be my fate.

312
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,288
>> It's so important to get
fire.

313
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:14,541
This is the most important thing
right now, so we need to get

314
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:15,667
a...
>> But yesterday...

315
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,253
>> We spent how many hours with
that thing yesterday?

316
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:20,589
I'm wiped.
>> How many hours did we spend

317
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,132
yesterday?
>> You tell me.

318
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,051
>> Not many, I don't think we
spend more than two.

319
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,927
>> Of course we know we have to
get fire.

320
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,263
But to have somebody, you know,
"The sky is falling!

321
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:30,932
The sky is falling!," it really
started to become grating.

322
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,559
>> I am not trying to be pushy
here.

323
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,269
>> No, no, no, I'm not saying
you are.

324
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:35,771
>> Okay, but our problem is
huge.

325
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,564
>> I'm saying right now I can't
do that.

326
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,149
>> Right, I'm not asking you to
do it.

327
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,318
>> You are asking.
You're saying "It's imperative.

328
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,278
We've got to get dynamic,
blah, blah, blah."

329
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,946
I'm just telling you I'm really
tired.

330
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,574
>> I'm not asking you to do it.
>> This isn't going to solve

331
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:50,118
anything here.
>> I don't have any support

332
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,496
here.
And I'm frustrated that these

333
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:56,792
people are being more cautious
about this.

334
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,460
>> I just don't like the
urgency.

335
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,755
You know, it's like, I'm working
my butt off and just getting all

336
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,423
panicky and stuff is
frustrating.

337
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:06,635
>> I'm Irish so I have that
Irish temper and she sparked it

338
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:10,430
and I did feel bad about it.
So then now I became fixated on

339
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:14,101
getting the fire to basically
neutralize my outburst.

340
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:17,813
So I was like, "Damn it.
I'm starting a fire."

341
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,607
>> Oh, sweet, sweet, sweet!
>> Oh, we're not even getting

342
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,651
full sun.
You're going to get full sun in

343
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,819
a second.
Keep it going.

344
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,529
You're going to get a big old
blast.

345
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:34,287
>> Oh, wow, there we go, baby.
Here, sun, sun, sun.

346
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,622
>> Nice.
Yeah!

347
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:38,792
>> Thank you!
>> Yes!

348
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:44,506
>> Fire!
>> Yeah!

349
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,509
>> You knew if you left those
kids alone for a few minutes,

350
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:56,309
we could do something right.
>> Once we had the fire, then

351
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:59,646
everything was forgotten, and
she really started to come

352
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:02,691
around with a personality, and
attempting to bond.

353
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,694
>> We got fire, girlfriend.
I know it was important with

354
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,654
you.
>> Kathy.

355
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,699
No, no.
You put the fire under my butt,

356
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:17,414
you take it.
>> The nectar of gods.

357
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:27,132
>> I think it's those two
coconut trees right there.

358
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,550
See?
Large boulder.

359
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,218
>> That's where we have to get
the water from.

360
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,387
>> Water, I wonder if we can go
up this giant creek?

361
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,389
We're going to go hike up to the
water source.

362
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:36,057
Go check it out.
>> We got a little bit of an

363
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,393
adventure, but the big thing is
we need to get the water so we

364
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:40,520
can start tackling all the other
things without getting

365
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:45,859
dehydrated.
>> Do you think we go up more?

366
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,903
>> No, no, this is it.
We done looked.

367
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,404
This is it.
>> All right!

368
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:50,572
Agua.
And it bubbled up.

369
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:55,785
This is the beginning of it.
See it bubbling over there?

370
00:24:55,869 --> 00:25:01,082
>> Oh, that looks nice.
>> Oh, yeah, we got water.

371
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,419
Where's the other one?
Mountain spring.

372
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,254
Here.
>> It was a huge relief that

373
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,341
there was actually water there
because it's the dry season now,

374
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:12,260
so we were excited, got our
water, came back to the fire and

375
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:22,312
immediately started boiling.
>> I'm a workaholic anyhow.

376
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:28,944
immediately started boiling.
>> I'm a workaholic anyhow.

377
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,779
I caught myself trying to do too
much.

378
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,907
You know, everyone is trying to
put their best face forward and

379
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:39,162
trying to show that they're an
integral part of the team, and

380
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:47,420
all of a sudden I realized that
I had to just, like, slow down.

381
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,464
Then I went over and talked to
Sean.

382
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,425
Sean was great, you know.
He's telling me to chill.

383
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:55,428
>> Man, this feels so good.
>> Are you chilling all?

384
00:25:55,512 --> 00:26:00,141
>> Under the shade, something
with some support.

385
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,101
We're chilling.
Right?

386
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,895
Isn't that what we're doing?
>> We're chilling.

387
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,189
You got to tell me some Harlem
stuff.

388
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,858
I want to go back and...
>> Harlem stuff?

389
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:13,321
That's not Harlem stuff, man.
Well, give me some stuff to work

390
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,283
with, for God's sakes!
>> Where you going to use it?

391
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,660
Where you going to use, uh...
You going to walk up to a

392
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,953
brother and go "Hey, I'm
chilling."

393
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:24,165
>> We talked and he almost, for
me, reminded me simply of, you

394
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,294
know, and it's really
comfortable to be yourself.

395
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:31,339
Then all of a sudden different
tribe members came over and like

396
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,550
we were having a real
conversation.

397
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:36,386
And it's nice to have real
conversation with people.

398
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:44,686
If someone said...
all this la-di-da and it's

399
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:50,191
simply to master every hole in
your body, how you breathe, how

400
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:55,822
you speak, how you see, how you
hear, how you urinate, how you

401
00:26:55,905 --> 00:27:00,702
go to the bathroom and until you
are aware of even that, most

402
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,913
people around aren't even aware
they have seven holes in their

403
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,915
head.
>> He looks like a normal guy,

404
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,960
you know, but he's going on and
on about being holy.

405
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:12,213
And I'm thinking he's talking
about spiritualness, but he's

406
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,424
talking about actual holes in
your body.

407
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:20,055
I mean, he's a Froot Loop.
>> The holes of your

408
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,891
elimination, people don't like
to talk about it, but, it's

409
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:26,019
really, I mean, if you want to
be holy, you might as well start

410
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,896
with becoming aware.
>> Of your holes.

411
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:28,980
Holy.
Holy.

412
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,358
>> All right, I've had enough of
this conversation.

413
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:34,319
>> Then you're aware of what
you're saying to people.

414
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:37,405
>> I don't understand what
you're talking about, not one

415
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,574
thing.
All of a sudden I loosen up, you

416
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:41,576
know, be yourself.
Sean did it to me.

417
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:53,880
I'm chilling here.
>> Ho, ho, ho!

418
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:56,257
Oh, my, our first mail.
>> We got mail!

419
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,051
>> Should we all open it
together?

420
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:01,388
>> Yeah, here we go.
Ooh!

421
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,056
What is it?
It's a message on a...

422
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,558
>> Oh, crap, we're going to have
to row some more.

423
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,061
>> Oh, no!
On the water?

424
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,105
>> All right.
Ready?

425
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:13,233
Read it out loud.
>> "You'll be in over your head

426
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:16,361
to get to the flame.
The weak ones will dread the

427
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:19,280
thought of this game.
It's a long tough trail.

428
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,117
Avoid a rocky start.
Fail to work as a team,

429
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,329
you'll be the first to part.
>> Ooh.

430
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:43,179
>> PROBST: Welcome.
How was the journey over, Sean?

431
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:46,099
>> Ha, y'all are crazy.
(<i> laughter</i> )

432
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,768
>> PROBST: Anybody have any luck
with fire?

433
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:49,936
>> Yeah!
(<i> applause</i> )

434
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:53,440
>> PROBST: Good, because in
addition to no food, no water,

435
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:56,484
you're getting no fire help from
us at all of any kind at any

436
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,486
time.
That means if you have fire,

437
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,906
treasure it, take care of it.
When it rains, you better have a

438
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,284
backup plan.
There's no matches coming.

439
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:09,122
This is what you want to covet.
Everybody, put your hand on

440
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,374
that.
Everybody, get a little hand on

441
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,126
this immunity idol.
>> Yeah!

442
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,962
>> Whoo!
>> PROBST: It is your first

443
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,339
immunity challenge.
Win it, your tribe is guaranteed

444
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,008
another three days on the
island.

445
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,844
Lose, your tribe is going right
there, Tribal Council, somebody

446
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,804
is going to be the first person
voted out.

447
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,056
That brings us to today's
challenge.

448
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,350
Here's how it works.
Each tribe has an outrigger

449
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,020
canoe outfitted with two
torches, so you're looking at

450
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,023
about 300 pounds right now dry.
On my "Go," you're going to take

451
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:38,026
your canoe, run down the beach
and then swim with it out in the

452
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,653
ocean to the center wok, where
you will light both of your

453
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:41,863
torches.
Treasure those torches.

454
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,407
They're very important because
you're going to turn around and

455
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,826
start lighting your woks--
four-- as you make your way back

456
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,204
toward the beach.
Once you get to the beach, it's

457
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:52,707
a sprint down a very uneven and
very rocky beach where you will

458
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,835
light three more torches.
First tribe to reach the end,

459
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,339
get their canoe back in the
stand, and then light the final

460
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,549
wok, wins immunity.
You guys ready for this?

461
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,551
>> Yeah!
>> PROBST: Get ready to start.

462
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:08,723
Wait for my "Go."
This is for immunity.

463
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:13,228
Survivors ready!
Go!

464
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:22,362
(<i> shouting</i> )
>> High, high, high, high, high.

465
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:27,408
Up, up.
(<i> shouting</i> )

466
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:37,502
>> We got somebody down.
>> Please do not tip the boat!

467
00:30:37,585 --> 00:31:10,118
>> We got somebody down.
>> Please do not tip the boat!

468
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:15,415
If this gets water in it, we are
screwed.

469
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:28,761
Light it up there.
Light it again!

470
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:41,190
Hurry.
>> Hurry up, hurry up!

471
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:51,284
♪ ♪
>> Woo!

472
00:31:51,367 --> 00:32:37,872

>> Woo!

473
00:32:37,955 --> 00:32:41,376
>> Put the torch back.
>> No need, no need.

474
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,711
>> They're going to be coming
through the same way.

475
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:53,805

(<i> shouting indistinctly</i> )

476
00:32:53,888 --> 00:33:00,812
>> Someone get the last one.
(<i> shouting indistinctly</i> )

477
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:18,037
>> Woo!
>> PROBST: Rotu, immunity.

478
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:24,544
Who wants it?
You guys are safe for three more

479
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,254
days.
Unfortunately, one of you guys

480
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,923
are going home tomorrow night.
We have a day till Tribal

481
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:29,841
Council.
Good effort.

482
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,926
Head back that way.
I'll see you tomorrow.

483
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:41,978
One, two, three, Rotu!
>> We lost our first immunity

484
00:33:42,061 --> 00:34:12,467
One, two, three, Rotu!
>> We lost our first immunity

485
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,637
challenge yesterday, and today
we have to go to Tribal Council.

486
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,890
So the game has begun.
>> The party is over.

487
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:21,184
We first got here.
We started the fire early.

488
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:24,145
Everybody got to work.
But now we lost the challenge

489
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,814
and the reality set in.
Somebody has to go.

490
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:30,151
>> My strategy is to keep as
strong as, as strong as

491
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:33,112
possible.
>> The impression the tribe gave

492
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:37,533
me was that I needed to be voted
off to keep the tribe strong.

493
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,869
I'm not weak.
I know I'm not 25.

494
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:44,207
I'm twice that.
I know I can't keep up with you

495
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,710
in a foot race, but I can be
steady, I can endure, you know.

496
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:51,547
I said is it because I'm a woman
or I'm overweight, is it because

497
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:55,009
they think me a mama figure--
all that was going through my

498
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:56,719
mind.
>> A lot of times the person

499
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,930
that looks strongest right out
of the chute.

500
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,849
>> We don't know what's going to
happen, is all I'm saying.

501
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,227
>> That's called life.
>> I'm glad you told me your

502
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,813
strategy, but I don't want to
talk about it right now.

503
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:10,358
We're going to go tonight and
nobody is to convince me to vote

504
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,653
any way because I'm going to
vote the way I want to vote.

505
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:16,364
That's the way it is.
I guess Peter got on our nerves

506
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:19,158
this morning a little bit
because he came up and called us

507
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,869
all over and wanted to talk
about what the strategy of the

508
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,788
game was and how he was going to
do it.

509
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:27,583
>> I'm not this magical mystical
person, all right?

510
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,586
>> Mm-hmm.
>> I think if you want to get

511
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:34,382
the truth of the situation, you
just can look in someone's eyes.

512
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,385
That's not just like, that's not
like, "Ooh!," you know.

513
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,720
I would have to say tonight that
I'm going to vote for Peter.

514
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,098
He's just got this strange smirk
on his face, always looks like

515
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,601
he's up to something.
He's just strange.

516
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:46,894
>> I know you don't have an
alliance.

517
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,398
I know I don't have an alliance.
>> I mean, an alliance right now

518
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,568
means absolutely nothing.
>> I did think about who I

519
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:57,780
possibly may want to vote out,
and I was thinking the whole

520
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,575
time maybe Sarah.
Just today feels too good to be

521
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,785
in the water and not, like,
doing stuff, you know?

522
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,580
>> When you look at Sarah and
you go, other than having two

523
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,624
floating devices that can help
us out there, what value is she

524
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,459
to the group, other than looking
cute?

525
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:14,589
It's very uncomfortable for all
of us because we're all one

526
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,425
family.
It's not chauvinistic, but the

527
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:21,762
more males you have in a camp,
the better I think you can

528
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,056
survive.
>> Good luck.

529
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,727
>> Good luck.
>> Good luck, Peter.

530
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:32,315
>> Thanks, bud.
>> There's three people that I

531
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,942
might choose to vote on:
Patricia, if you look at

532
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,279
physical strength, she is the
weakest person, maybe, just

533
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,282
because she's old;
Sarah, I think she knows she can

534
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,493
maybe use her body with the men,
the guys of the tribe;

535
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,163
and Peter because of what
happened this morning.

536
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:53,377
But right now I have no clue who
I'm going to vote for.

537
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,671
>> Eventually every one us is
going but the winner.

538
00:36:55,755 --> 00:37:05,765
And who knows who that will be?
>> PROBST: Behind each of you

539
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:19,362
And who knows who that will be?
>> PROBST: Behind each of you

540
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,614
guys is a tribal torch.
Why don't you go ahead and find

541
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:26,994
your torch and approach the
flame?

542
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:36,337
Go ahead and put it back in its
slot.

543
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,548
We do this because fire does
represent life at Tribal

544
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,801
Council.
As long as you have fire, you

545
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:45,388
have life in this game.
When your fire is gone, so are

546
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,597
you.
It's that simple.

547
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:50,059
Now, all over the Marquesas
there are ancient dwellings like

548
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:52,895
this one, thousands of years
things have taken place,

549
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,189
everything from sacrifices to
other rituals.

550
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:57,525
Tribal Council is certainly a
ritual.

551
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,653
The vote, definitely a
sacrifice.

552
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:03,823
Because this is where you're
held accountable for your

553
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,325
actions on the island.
Sometimes those actions are

554
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,703
going to help you; sometimes
they're going to hurt you.

555
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,037
That's what the vote is all
about.

556
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,872
That's what we're going
to find out tonight.

557
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:15,167
But before we get to the first
vote, let's talk about the first

558
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,670
few days.
Gina, what's it like having to

559
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:21,340
source your own food, your own
water and your own fire?

560
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,760
Is it rewarding at the end of
the day to say, "We created all

561
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,887
of this?"
>> Yeah, it's very rewarding to

562
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,389
do that.
We're not given rice.

563
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,683
We're not given water.
We're not given fire.

564
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:33,436
We won't be given any of those
and we have to get it and

565
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,522
we've got it.
And that... that's awesome.

566
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:40,776
>> PROBST: Pete, did a leader
emerge yet, a clear leader, or

567
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:44,572
is it still a tribe?
>> Yeah, somebody did step up,

568
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:49,035
and I value the fact that Hunter
did step up because I wouldn't

569
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:52,580
have wanted it any other way.
He has been optimistic.

570
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:56,417
He has been open, asking each
and every one of us what we

571
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,420
suggest, and I really value and
respect that.

572
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,256
>> PROBST: Peter, feel like you
fit in with this group?

573
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:04,008
>> Actually, I never felt
comfortable.

574
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,886
Once I got on land, just didn't
feel quite right to me, and I

575
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,221
was very surprised.
I thought it was going to be a

576
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,474
piece of cake for me.
>> PROBST: Sarah, do you think

577
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:14,101
you have a role yet to find?
>> Kind of everything, we're all

578
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,312
just sticking together, doing
what needs to be done.

579
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,773
We're all come together like
that, but I mean, there are some

580
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,275
of us that are definitely better
at things than others, but I'm

581
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:23,110
just kind of jumping in.
>> PROBST: Okay.

582
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:26,113
Well, somebody always has the
distinction of being the first

583
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:29,450
person voted out of the tribe.
It's time to find out who that

584
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,786
person is.
Here's how it's going to work.

585
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:35,122
One by one, you guys are going
to make your way along the rock

586
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,083
path up to the voting
confessional.

587
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:40,127
You'll write down the name of
the person you're voting out in

588
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,422
clear letters, hold it up, state
the reason why you're voting for

589
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,758
that person.
Okay, it's time to vote.

590
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:55,810
Peter, you're first.
>> Tricia, you deserve to stay.

591
00:39:55,893 --> 00:40:04,944
Peter, you're first.
>> Tricia, you deserve to stay.

592
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,815
>> This person is a very nice
person, but he did a couple

593
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,859
things today that really kind of
threw me off.

594
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:54,910
So my vote is for Peter.
>> Sarah, I love you like a play

595
00:40:54,994 --> 00:41:18,058
So my vote is for Peter.
>> Sarah, I love you like a play

596
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,352
cousin.
I just don't think you was doing

597
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:31,030
your... your end of the bargain.
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

598
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:41,081
votes.
Once the votes are read, the

599
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:49,256
votes.
Once the votes are read, the

600
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,091
decision is final.
The person voted out will be

601
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,093
asked to leave the Tribal
Council area immediately.

602
00:41:53,177 --> 00:42:01,936
I'll read the votes.
First vote...

603
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:12,780
Peter.
Sarah.

604
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:23,666
Patricia.
Sarah.

605
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,793
Peter.
That's two votes Peter;

606
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:30,965
two votes Sarah;
one vote Patricia.

607
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:35,719
Peter.
Three votes Peter.

608
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:39,598
First person voted out of the
tribe: Peter.

609
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,642
No need to read the last vote.
We'll leave that a mystery.

610
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:46,397
Peter, you need to bring me your
torch.

611
00:42:53,570 --> 00:43:01,036
Peter, the tribe has spoken.
>> Go get them.

612
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:11,130
>> PROBST: Time for you to go.
You survived your first vote.

613
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:17,011
>> PROBST: Time for you to go.
You survived your first vote.

614
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,346
Now go back and build your
world.

615
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,515
It's only been three days.
Anything can happen.

616
00:43:21,598 --> 00:43:23,600
Head back to camp.
I'll see you tomorrow.

617
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:39,491
Stay tuned for scenes from our
next episode.

618
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:44,830
>> PROBST: Next time on
<i>Survivor:</i> At Maraamu...

619
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,498
>> Here's the plan:
Go gather some coconuts.

620
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,875
>> PROBST: ...Patricia takes
charge.

621
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,210
>> This is the tool tree.
We're going to leave the

622
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,254
machetes here.
>> She's doing too much talking.

623
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:56,050
>> PROBST: At Rotu, a hungry
tribe competes for the kill.

624
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,386
(<i> whistles</i> )
But it's Kathy that finds food.

625
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,014
>> Get out here.
I'm serious!

626
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:10,522
>> Sometimes I take myself a
little too seriously.

627
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:14,193
I wish I had heeded my wife's
advice of just come to this

628
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:17,863
island and have fun.
And truly, the other seven

629
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:23,410
contestants, I love them dearly
and I'll have fond memories of

630
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,705
this adventure.
