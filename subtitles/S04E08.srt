1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:02,419
>> PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:05,422
<i>Survivor</i> : Rob and Kathy
prepared for the merge and made

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,966
a pact to protect each other.
>> I am really serious.

4
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,926
Don't stab me.
>> I swear to God I will never

5
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:13,054
vote you off.
>> PROBST: The next day Maraamu

6
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:17,726
had to break camp and set sail
for Rotu where the two tribes

7
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,769
merge.
>> One, two, three, Soliantu.

8
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,771
>> PROBST: But unity was short-
lived.

9
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:25,400
In an attempt to undermine the
original Rotu alliance of four,

10
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:28,528
Rob confronted Zoe.
>> Tell the truth for once, will

11
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,029
ya?
>> They're all lying to me.

12
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,240
I need the immunity because I'm
getting the ax.

13
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:35,785
>> PROBST: At the challenge,
Kathy won a crucial immunity.

14
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:39,789
Back at camp, tensions flared,
bringing chaos to Soliantu.

15
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,499
>> Everybody was like, we a
team, we a team.

16
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,793
Soon as these three come over...
>> All right, all right.

17
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,295
Well, everything's coming out
tonight.

18
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,589
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,
Rob was voted off.

19
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:52,093
Rob, the tribe has spoken.
Nine are left.

20
00:00:52,177 --> 00:01:02,145
Who will be voted out tonight?
>> I know it's a somber mood

21
00:01:02,228 --> 00:02:14,384
Who will be voted out tonight?
>> I know it's a somber mood

22
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,053
because we had to vote somebody
out, but you guys, we're all on

23
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,888
the jury.
That's a huge accomplishment.

24
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,557
You guys should all feel really
good.

25
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,561
>> I feel great.
>> I feel wonderful.

26
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:28,022
>> I feel wonderful, too.
>> Wonderful, wonderful.

27
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:32,861
>> Before Tribal Council, I
pulled Rob aside and I told him

28
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:36,155
that I was going to be voting
for him, and he was okay about

29
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,323
it.
But I wanted him to hear it from

30
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,576
me and I didn't want him to
think that I was trying to do

31
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,911
anything behind his back,
especially being a previous

32
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,540
Maraamu and having an agreement
with him at one time.

33
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:48,251
>> Have the last couple of
nights been kind of cold for you

34
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,127
guys?
>> Yeah.

35
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,753
>> Yes.
>> Like colder than usual, huh?

36
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,589
>> Yes.
>> After the Tribal Council,

37
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,592
with Rob being gone, the mood
around here is so totally

38
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,094
different.
It's so much more relaxed and

39
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:01,598
peaceful, you know.
There isn't a threat that some

40
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:05,602
wise-ass remark's going to be
made and set off a whole new

41
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:10,481
fight going on for no good
reason.

42
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,900
>> Who farted?
>> I did.

43
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,443
>> It stinks.
>> Excuse me.

44
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:18,114
That was the first fart that
actually had substance.

45
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:21,618
>> This diet has played havoc, I
guess, with Sean's system,

46
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:25,288
because he does have a little
bit of a flatulent problem, but

47
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,666
I sleep down the other end of
the tent and I'm usually upwind,

48
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,627
so I've been a little bit
fortunate.

49
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,630
>> I'm sorry, y'all.
I thought it was enough time to

50
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,841
air it out over here, but...
>> Sean is definitely... you

51
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,302
know, he'll probably the next
one voted off.

52
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,930
Everybody's talking about Sean
being a problem.

53
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,974
He just doesn't work hard.
He complains.

54
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:49,312
He farts a lot.
>> What was that?

55
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,980
>> I'm just messing everybody
up.

56
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:51,898
>> Dude.
>> Sean...

57
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,233
>> I'm sorry.
>> You're sleeping somewhere

58
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,152
else.
>> I'm playing the game exactly

59
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:59,364
how I came in playing, which is
if you're true to yourself,

60
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,951
that's the true game of life.
The only thing that's changing

61
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,911
is my attitude.
(breaks wind)

62
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:09,123
Oh, see how happy I am?
I can pass gas and feel free as

63
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,291
a bird.
>> Sean.

64
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,960
>> Sean.
>> Wasn't me.

65
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:15,296
I cleaned mine.
Some nasty ass over here...

66
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:20,468
>> Good night, everybody.
>> Good night.

67
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:25,264
>> I got up before daybreak.
I was out by the fire.

68
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,851
I couldn't sleep, so I got out
and I was sitting by the fire

69
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:33,564
thinking of my wife and my
daughters.

70
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:23,781
>> We got up this morning, and
there was... we had a real windy

71
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:28,369
night and a real windy morning,
and as you can see, two trees

72
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:32,248
came right down on camp.
We're very lucky that they fell

73
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:36,085
this way instead of falling on
our... falling on our tent.

74
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,005
>> Yeah, a couple more feet and
that could have been on our

75
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,548
tent.
>> Don't say that.

76
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:46,929
But it wasn't.
Praise God.

77
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,723
>> We have to go over what
happened yesterday.

78
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,517
I was just confused about the
fact that if there was an

79
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,312
original alliance to vote me off
first when I came here.

80
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:57,940
I just wanted to know about it.
>> Definitely not, Kathy.

81
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,610
>> Okay.
>> But was there one formed just

82
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,820
to get Rob in a different
position?

83
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,948
>> That was my intention, and
that's what I tried to express

84
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,868
yesterday.
There was never any intention of

85
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,287
voting you off in no way in
hell.

86
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,956
We wanted to get Rotu back
together as a team.

87
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,251
>> Zoe just lied to me
point-blank about the fact that

88
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:20,963
the tribe had definitely scoped
me out for the first vote off

89
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,257
when we merged.
I think Zoe's been lying from

90
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,301
the beginning.
I think she's been playing both

91
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,511
sides, and I just can't take
that.

92
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:30,139
Whoever wins wins, but I don't
want to be the pawn, you know?

93
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,308
>> Right.
>> So I'm going to fight tooth

94
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,310
and nail to find out what's
going on.

95
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:37,271
But not to the point where I
upset my friendships.

96
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,149
I don't want to upset
friendships with people.

97
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,360
>> I don't either.
>> I was going to push her

98
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:45,154
further on it, but I just
decided for good negotiations,

99
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,449
not to get voted off.
I wanted her to feel a little

100
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,451
guilty.
I think I did that.

101
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,538
>> But I'm just happy that we
got through this, and then when

102
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,498
Sean's voted off...
>> One day at a time.

103
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,334
>> ...then we'll deal with what
we're doing with each other, all

104
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:59,001
right?
>> Good.

105
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,671
>> Okay, good.
Thanks, sweetie.

106
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:11,722
♪ ♪
>> I don't know why, but I get

107
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:17,478
♪ ♪
>> I don't know why, but I get

108
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,356
empowered by these waterfalls.
It's the freshwater and it's

109
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:23,860
just... it's invigorating.
So I wanted to be up there and

110
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:27,864
just feel that pressure point on
my back and kind of wake up and

111
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,199
start a new day in a better
direction.

112
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:39,876
>> There, you got it.
>> 5.8.

113
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,712
>> Nobody has ever complained
about going to the waterfall

114
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,840
because that's one place where
we go, jump in the water, it's

115
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,884
nice and cold.
It cools us off and totally

116
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,552
refreshes us.
For me, it rejuvenates

117
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,138
everything inside of me, and I'm
ready to go again after I get

118
00:07:52,221 --> 00:08:03,691
out of there.
>> Oh, my God, look, you guys.

119
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,818
What is it?
They're, like, flags or

120
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,029
something.
>> And when we got up the

121
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,406
waterfall and we were on our way
back, we checked the tree mail

122
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:11,741
and sure enough, we had tree
mail.

123
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,784
>> Oh, my God, they're
umbrellas.

124
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,703
>> Oh, yeah.
>> These are kites.

125
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,039
>> This is like a picnic thing,
I think.

126
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,624
>> Wow.
Let's bring back the whole

127
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:23,461
basket, so everybody can see it.
That is cool.

128
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:26,923
>> You guys, check this out.
So it says here: "You may be

129
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:31,219
feeling grounded.
Now how high can you go?

130
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:36,349
Find the wind under your wings
to see wonders down below.

131
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:40,519
Here's some items to build a
kite, though you're not

132
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:45,274
restricted to just these.
Make yours fly the highest first

133
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,402
and you'll explore these exotic
seas."

134
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,656
Taking you out in a boat and
you're going to eat.

135
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:55,451
It was a pretty cool tree mail.
It was a really good twist of

136
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:58,788
trying to make kites and then we
have to fly them and then we get

137
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:10,424
a reward.
>> (yelling)

138
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,761
Too much wind.
>> I got a kite and a new outfit

139
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:18,766
out of this challenge.
>> I think the next facet of

140
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:22,687
this game is to eliminate the
non-Rotu people.

141
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,314
I think Sean will go first, but
I don't think we're going to

142
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,984
start voting off power.
I want to, believe me.

143
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,112
I would love to vote off John or
Tammy, but I don't know if I can

144
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,864
really get Paschal to listen.
He likes to make his own

145
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,325
decisions about honesty and
trustworthiness.

146
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,453
>> See, I asked Zoe that.
I just point-blank asked her:

147
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,622
"Did you guys ever consider
voting me off?"

148
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,833
And she said no.
>> Well, that's true.

149
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,962
They didn't.
You're getting all this negative

150
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,880
stuff.
>> You know, if I'm used as a

151
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:53,092
pawn for them to win and I'm on
the jury and I have to vote for

152
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,344
them and they took me and...
>> We'll find out.

153
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,014
>> Yeah, but they're going to
use us to get to the top.

154
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,807
>> So?
>> All right.

155
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:04,312
I need to have Paschal and Neleh
experience some of this turmoil.

156
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:07,523
A couple more pieces of turmoil
and they see how people act,

157
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:11,152
then they might commit to
understanding that the powerful

158
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,030
people need to go.
>> Oh, my kite is going to be a

159
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,698
miserable failure.
>> Oh, stop it.

160
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:19,577
>> I'm serious.
>> Ah, go fly a kite.

161
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:30,379
>> Yeah.
>> PROBST: Welcome, guys.

162
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,381
Today's challenge is very
simple.

163
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,052
The first person to get their
kite 300 feet in the air wins.

164
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,972
You'll know you're at 300 feet
because at the end of your spool

165
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:44,310
you'll see a purple ribbon.
Once that clears your spool, you

166
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,062
win.
Now, to the reward, and I hope

167
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,689
this brings a smile to your
face.

168
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:53,527
To start, a delicious Snickers
bar.

169
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,112
Ain't no regular Snickers
either.

170
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,448
It's the big one.
>> Oh, yeah.

171

>> PROBST: Freshly chilled

>> PROBST: Dig in, John.

175
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,778
The winner of the reward gets
the king-size Snickers, and

176
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:39,490
you're going to eat it en route
to a deep sea dive in one of the

177
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,492
most spectacular places on
Earth.

178
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,745
A good chance to see manta rays,
eels, hammerhead sharks.

179
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:45,746
You go out with somebody
experienced.

180
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,540
They'll teach you everything you
need to know.

181
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,000
Have a great time.
All right, pick your spool.

182
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:53,421
Tie it up to your kite.
Spread out along the beach.

And by the time I was all suited

up and I was about ready to do

underwater, it's like going from
day to night, only it's going

234
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:45,611
from air to a whole 'nother
world under there.

235
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,207
You really truly feel like a
fish out of water, you know.

236
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,418
This isn't our abode.
There isn't where we're supposed

237
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,463
to be, and I feel that I'm
infiltrating something--

238
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:09,009
that we're not supposed to be
down there, but it's gorgeous.

239
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,861
There were some rays kicking
around.

240
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:33,784
And the amount of fish is equal
to being in a massive aquarium.

241
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,958
It was a vacation down there,
getting away from the tribe and

242
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,752
the island and everything.
I just feel like I'm so far away

243
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:48,090
from everything down there.
No stress.

00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:02,104

single Tribal Council, we go in

246
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,109

myself, Big Rob, John and Zoe,

we've all decided to vote the
same for the next three votes.

249
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,955
Sean is the one.
>> I'm trying to leave here

250
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:23,542
playing the game.
I get frustrated because I feel

251
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:27,337
like nobody's playing the game.
I know I'm definitely next.

252
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,173
I didn't come out for no
vacation.

253
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,091
I came out to bring home the
bacon.

254
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,051
I'm not...
All I can do is go out trying.

255
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,721
I'm telling you the truth.
I'm going to talk to Kathy and

256
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,849
I'm going to talk to Neleh.
>> Sean, I think, probably is

257
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:42,519
feeling very vulnerable right
now and is trying to stir the

258
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:46,315
pot a little bit, to cause some
possible doubts about what's

259
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,443
going to happen tomorrow night
in the event he doesn't win

260
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,654
immunity or whether or not he's
got the votes to keep him on.

261
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,991
So it's fascinating to watch
all this take place.

262
00:17:56,074 --> 00:18:00,329
>> Let's pray for a moment.
Father God, in the name of

263
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:05,125
Jesus, another grateful morning
to be in your presence.

264
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:23,894
>> God, that was hysterical.
I feel like a dead fish.

265
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,157
Hey, how are you?
>> Tell me about it.

266
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,784
>> It was great.
It was beautiful.

267
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:42,663
It was exciting.
And we got a Snickers bar, so

268
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,873
I'm excited.
We're going to have some

269
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,209
chocolate.
The real motivational force for

270
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,379
bringing the Snickers bar back
was for peace of mind.

271
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:55,384
So if they had any beef that I
won a challenge again, then I

272
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,887
thought the Snicker bar would
just kind of entice good

273
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,558
feelings from the tribe.
It could also backfire, like I'm

274
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,728
trying to bribe them.
Oh, my God.

275
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,731
I am now going to be eating
Snicker bars.

276
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,901
We all would have had a hard
time bringing it back, so that

277
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,404
was very, very generous of you.
Thank you.

278
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:19,908
>> I like having you guys happy.
There's too much tension on the

279
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,742
beach.
>> No.

280
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,910
That was great.
Thanks.

281
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,831
>> It was a beautiful gesture on
Kathy's part, you know, an

282
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,917
eighth of a Snicker isn't going
to change my vote, but I do

283
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,587
appreciate the gesture and it
was a very sweet thing for her

284
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,755
to do.
>> There's a bond here.

285
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,384
>> Yep, there definitely is.
>> It may be a different kind of

286
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,928
bond, but there's a bond.
>> Right.

287
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,389
>> Everybody's, like, we're all
family and I'm like, you know,

288
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:43,891
everything ain't hunky-dory over
here.

289
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,101
Things are going on.
People are not to be trusted.

290
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:48,770
But while you're still in the
game, you've got to kind of be

291
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,647
vague, but still put it out.
Maybe Kathy.

292
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,901
If I can maybe get Kathy,
then maybe she can get Pappy and

293
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,485
Neleh.
At this point, all gloves is

294
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,862
off.
It's like, let's go for the

295
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,155
gusto.
This is a million bucks.

296
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,657
We have one in nine.
We'll never have these odds in

297
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,284
our favor.
This isn't just a game.

298
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,286
We're now going to head into
crunch time.

299
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,954
We have a chance to win the
million.

300
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,875
>> The only thing I can say is I
totally agree with you.

301
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,295
I think Tammy and John are
playing the game and they're

302
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,589
playing it so hard, it's
obnoxious.

303
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,258
>> If you're in agreement, you
me and V are on the same

304
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,594
wavelength.
>> Yeah, we are, but we just

305
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:23,639
need to get Paschal and Neleh
and you know what?

306
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:28,060
I think we can do it.
I think this alliance stuff is

307
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:31,438
what's killing us here.
>> You just know there's going

308
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,483
to be alliances, you know, no
matter what, so...

309
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,652
>> Really?
>> Yeah, no matter what.

310
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,155
And no matter... the bigger
stink you make about things, the

311
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:42,324
more vulnerable you are, so...
>> I know.

312
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,285
>> Being voted out fifth totally
is fine.

313
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,914
She feels if you make too many
waves, she said, "Kathy, if you

314
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:52,209
talk any more about that, you're
going to get voted off."

315
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:55,504
So now, Paschal's sort of the
pivotal vote.

316
00:20:55,587 --> 00:21:01,510
I don't want to be a pawn to
help Tammy and John go to the

317
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,720
top.
I want it to be even.

318
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:07,224
>> I'm not aligning myself with
Sean and V.

319
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,518
>> You know what, Paschal?
>> No, you know what?

320
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,520
Here's the deal.
>> I want it to be fair.

321
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,064
>> Okay, here's the deal.
>> It should be fair.

322
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:20,028
>> Well, this game's not fair.
>> If I could have formed the

323
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,864
alliance with Sean and V and
Paschal and Neleh and myself,

324
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,742
I would have had a huge shot at
it, but that's not going to

325
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,911
happen.
Paschal wants Sean off, and so

326
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:35,419
does everybody else.
>> I'm feeling vulnerable

327
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,588
because of the warpath that
Sean went on, and so what I'm

328
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:42,050
worried about are there may be
people that may believe some of

329
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:46,388
the trash he was talking
and decide to vote against me.

330
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,599
>> Somebody who really sucked,
somebody who did nothing beat

331
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,894
me, that would just suck.
>> Well, that's exactly what I

332
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,564
told Neleh.
I said, "It is so important to

333
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:59,693
me that somebody like Sean
doesn't make it to the finals."

334
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:05,115
I said, "John deserves it.
Sean would be an embarrassment."

335
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:08,785
>> John picked up on something
that Sean may be under the

336
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:14,249
belief that he has Kathy and V
and me and Neleh with him, which

337
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:17,336
is incorrect.
And I just wanted to tell John

338
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:21,256
and I told him, I said, "You've
got my word that's not true."

339
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:24,634
When I give you my order... when
I give you my word, my word is

340
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:28,889
the most important thing to me
at my age."

341
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,724
I don't have much, but I got
that.

342
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:35,395
>> Neleh and Paschal, I think,
are really supporting my success

343
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,564
in this game and are really
rooting for me.

344
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:40,442
And knowing that you can rely
upon those two people, I mean,

345
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,819
it's like two free passes.
It's an amazing experience.

346
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:47,574
I mean it's actually kind of
mind-blowing.

347
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,000
>> Who didn't get one?
>> Is it good?

348
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,669
>> You didn't get any?
>> Thanks, buddy.

349
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,631
>> Thank you.
>> Mostly coconut with just a

350
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,967
little bit of taro in it.
>> I can pick the little taro

351
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,636
out.
>> The mood in the camp right

352
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,806
now seems to be, you know, we're
all on the jury and good luck to

353
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,809
everybody, but I do know "good
luck to everybody" really means

354
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:18,939
"good luck to Sean."
You know, every man for himself

355
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:25,946
is really Sean is for himself
swimming upstream.

356
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:30,117
>> See if my check came today,
please.

357
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:36,123
>> Pretty simple.
>> Okay.

358
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,333
"You've had time to learn this
place.

359
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:43,338
I hope you've prepared well.
If you've done your homework,

360
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:48,385
soon we all will tell.
Use your information wisely.

361
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,679
You can choose who you'll cut
down.

362
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:55,183
Hope you've played nicely.
It will help you stick around."

363
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,228
>> I just think it's going to
be, like, a process of

364
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,564
elimination maybe.
>> I don't trust any one of

365
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:03,024
these people in this game.
I'm trying to win immunity for

366
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,234
me.
I'm not giving it up if I win,

367
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,862
and if I lose, I'm going to
salute them and tell them, "Good

368
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,947
luck," because pretty much
that's how they wanted it.

369
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,699
I'm on my own.
Why would I want to trust any

370
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:15,078
one of them now at this stage
of the game?

371
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:30,093
>> PROBST: First things first.
Kathy, the immunity necklace

372
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:36,892
back up for grabs.
Okay.

373
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:40,604
For today's immunity challenge,
I'm going to ask you a series of

374
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:43,857
questions relating to life and
survival on the Marquesas

375
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,234
Islands.
Each of you has a station with

376
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,112
three bundles of coconuts
strung up to the top of a

377
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,531
coconut tree.
Every time you get an answer

378
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:55,285
correctly, you're going to take
the prong and chop down one pile

379
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:59,080
of coconuts of somebody else's.
You win immunity by knocking

380
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,583
everybody else out.
So when all three of your

381
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,377
coconut bundles have been
chopped down, you're out of the

382
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,421
game.
The last person left with

383
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:09,716
coconuts wins immunity.
Now, if more than one of you has

384
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,552
a correct answer, you'll each
get a turn at chopping down

385
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,429
coconuts in an order chosen at
random.

386
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:20,101
Get up your blocks and let's do
it.

387
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,896
All right, here we go.
First question: True or false:

388
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:26,483
in a prolonged survival
situation, drinking large

389
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:34,616
quantities of coconut milk will
help combat dehydration?

390
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:38,578
The correct answer is false.
It has a laxative effect.

391
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:41,623
General, step forward.
Tammy, step forward.

392
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:49,965
Sean, step forward.
Sean, you're first.

393
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:55,553
Tammy, you're second.
General, you go third.

394
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:04,479
>> Surprise, surprise.
Shock of all shocks.

395
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,356
>> Good form, man.
Good form.

396
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:07,941
>> PROBST: The game is on, huh,
Sean?

397
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,651
>> It's always been.
>> All right, Tammy.

398
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:21,621
>> PROBST: All right, Tammy.
>> Oh, I see what's going on.

399
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:25,917
>> PROBST: General.
Let's get this game going.

400
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,091
You're a marked man, Sean.
>> That's all right.

401
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:36,720
>> PROBST: Next question.
Cannibalism was common in the

402
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,806
Marquesas for which of the
following reasons:

403
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:43,518
A: as a means of purging the
sins of a tribe?

404
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:47,355
B: as a source of protein due to
the scarcity of meat?

405
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:52,652
C: a form of tribal sacrifice?
Or D: to seize the power of the

406
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:58,408
person being eaten?
The correct answer is D.

407
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:04,414
They wanted to seize the power.
John, V, Zoe, Sean and Neleh,

408
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,374
all got it right.
>> Kathy, I love you.

409
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:11,087
You're on a roll, girl.
No hurt feelings, though.

410
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:24,392
>> Nice job, baby.
>> Stay away from that green.

411
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,062
>> Oh, that was a tough one for
him.

412
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:31,733
Payback's a bitch.
Good man.

413
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:35,403
>> Sean?
>> I got that, baby, right here.

414
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,914
>> PROBST: All right, Sean,
you're the first casualty.

415
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,416
You can take your box, have a
seat right over here in the

416
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,459
viewing area.
Neleh.

417
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:55,382
>> Go, Sweet Pea.
>> PROBST: Vecepia takes a first

418
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,217
hit.
>> Sweet Pea, whoa, you'll be

419
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:02,430
cracking some nuts.
>> Oh, there's a conspiracy

420
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:08,103
going on, y'all.
>> Three strikes and you're....

421
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,772
>> I'm calling Johnny Cochran,
if somebody hits V's.

422
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:14,609
>> PROBST: True or false: Within
a survival situation at sea

423
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:17,987
without freshwater, you should
refrain from eating?

424
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:26,329
True or false?
The answer is true.

425
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:36,131
John, General, Paschal, Zoe,
Tammy.

426
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:39,134
>> Where's Johnny Cochran?
I want him on the phone right

427
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,970
now.
>> PROBST: Vecepia, you join

428
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:48,309
Sean in the waiting area.
Kathy takes her second hit.

429
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:54,983
>> You look tired, Kathy.
>> Ow!

430
00:28:55,066 --> 00:29:01,990
>> PROBST: Kathy's out of the
game, joins Sean and V.

431
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:08,329
Paschal takes his first hit.
>> Whoa!

432
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:12,709
>> A little to the right, John.
>> Sorry, Neleh.

433
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:16,713
>> PROBST: Neleh's got one hit.
>> Ow.

434
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:22,260
>> PROBST: With authority.
>> Yeah!

435
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:25,555
>> I swear we could take them
out, I swear we could.

436
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:28,308
>> I don't know if we had
Paschal and Neleh for sure,

437
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:34,856
though.
>> What, dear?

438
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:40,403
>> I said that was ugly of you.
>> PROBST: John, General just

439
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:44,157
took you out, but you still get
a shot.

440
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,661
>> This is the order how it's
going to go.

441
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:52,207
That's my boy.
>> You guys are cooking tonight.

442
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,876
>> PROBST: Paschal, you're out.
John, you're also out.

443
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,296
You can join the other three.
All right, Neleh.

444
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:02,217
General has all three of his
bundles of coconuts left.

445
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,678
Zoe and Neleh and Tammy, you
each have two left now.

446
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:09,682
Next question: In the Marquesas
Islands, what is a horse?

447
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:13,520
A: a rearing flower.
B: a vermilion sea creature

448
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,898
found in lagoons.
C: a horse like any other found

449
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:20,360
all over the world.
Or D: a traditional podium for

450
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:28,701
tiki statues.
Spanish explorers introduced

451
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:33,790
horses to the Marquesas, so a
horse is just a horse.

452
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:37,460
Everybody but Zoe step forward.
>> Everybody's got to have two,

453
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:44,759
also, right?
>> Ow!

454
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:49,597
Oh, nice.
>> One last person in the game

455
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:53,601
evens the odds.
>> Oh, good.

456
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,603
I needed a rest.
I'll remember.

457
00:30:55,687 --> 00:31:00,775
Don't worry.
>> PROBST: Payback's tough.

458
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:04,821
>> Heads up, General.
>> You want me to leave it out

459
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:05,905
for you?
>> Ooh.

460
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:09,784
>> Why wouldn't she have given
Neleh another chance?

461
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:17,458
>> You whacked me.
Turnaround is fair play.

462
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,128
>> PROBST: Take your box and
join the group.

463
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,463
>> Hey, it's green.
Money.

464
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,592
Money color, baby.
>> PROBST: It's down to you two.

465
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,801
You both get it right,
we'll move on.

466
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:30,305
Somebody misses, it's over.
True or false: The sea cucumber

467
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:35,268
can actually be deadly to human
beings?

468
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:38,479
It can cause burns, but it is
not deadly.

469
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,983
Tammy's right.
Chop down his last coconut.

470
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:47,113
I'll have immunity when you get
back.

471
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,665
>> Oh, doesn't that look
beautiful?

472
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,834
>> PROBST: Nicely done.
Tammy's safe from the vote.

473
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:02,837
Somebody else is going home.
See you at Tribal Council in a

474
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,173
few hours.
You guys can head back to camp.

475
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:09,052
Nice job.
So long.

476
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:35,995
>> You know how people always
say everything is not perfect.

477
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,915
When you get back from a
challenge, you find out just how

478
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,708
everything is not always
perfect.

479
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,211
>> Took care of business right
off the bat, man.

480
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:47,382
Thank you, baby.
>> At the challenge, there was

481
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:52,011
quite a bit of cockiness with
Tammy, Zoe, Big Rob and John.

482
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:55,431
>> I almost was going to do you
because I hated to get Paschal

483
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:59,060
at another time.
>> It didn't seem to bother you

484
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:04,232
that much.
>> Today in the trivia game,

485
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,818
Sean went out first, then V,
then Kathy.

486
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:10,780
I had some satisfaction that I
was the one that cut Sean's last

487
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:13,866
rope.
So hopefully that will be an

488
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:18,246
omen tonight.
>> Everybody saw for their own

489
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,416
eyes at the challenge how
arrogant the four was, and I

490
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,418
think it rubs people the wrong
way.

491
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,920
>> They just didn't play it
smart in that game.

492
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:28,589
>> They didn't.
>> Yeah, they were never going

493
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,092
to give us any consideration.
>> No way.

494
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,594
>> None.
>> I think the way that immunity

495
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:37,265
came down, the coconut chopping
and all, I think it signaled to

496
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,560
us that there was a pecking
order, and we were included in

497
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:43,604
it, even though we had been told
that that wasn't true.

498
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,691
>> When we saw the coconuts,
they hacked down John's, you

499
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:49,610
know, these just in the order
that they were going to

500
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,821
eliminate us.
I've been nothing but honest to

501
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,781
everybody.
I'm following my heart today.

502
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:58,411
I would be lying to my heart and
to myself if I went up there and

503
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:01,122
voted for Sean tonight.
This is really how I feel,

504
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,623
Paschal.
If me and you are going to get

505
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,292
anywhere towards the end, we
have to do this.

506
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,128
We would be fools not to.
I'm not going to go out with

507
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,796
those six.
We've worked too hard.

508
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,257
We've been here for too long,
worked too hard, and I'm not

509
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,593
going to go out like that.
I just had this feeling, you

510
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,803
know, especially after today's
immunity challenge.

511
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:19,098
I saw them hack down Paschal's
coconuts so fast, and inside I'm

512
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:26,022
just like, there's got to be
something changed here.

513
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,815
>> I don't know how to play this
game.

514
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,985
I have no clue how to play it.
I don't want to know how to play

515
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:35,198
it.
I tend to lay back and watch the

516
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:38,785
lay of the land and then when I
think I've got the lay of the

517
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:42,789
land figured out, I begin doing
something.

518
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:45,500
This is exactly how I am in the
courtroom, in life.

519
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:48,711
The only thing I can say is I
think I'm a fair and consistent

520
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,004
judge.
I think I'm a fair and

521
00:34:50,087 --> 00:35:04,352
consistent player.
>> I'm going to pack all my

522
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,355
stuff, and when I go to Tribal,
I'm fully prepared to be voted

523
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,440
out.
If it's going to be that they

524
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:13,194
vote me out ninth, I don't like
going out like a wimp because

525
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:17,073
I'd rather go out with my head
held high knowing that I tried,

526
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:19,534
than staying around dealing with
the tribal people saying, well,

527
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:24,163
at least five, six or seven is
not bad.

528
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:38,219
♪ ♪
>> PROBST: Welcome, guys.

529
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:51,607
♪ ♪
>> PROBST: Welcome, guys.

530
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,110
>> Jeff.
>> Hi, Jeff.

531
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,862
>> PROBST: V, about today's
challenge.

532
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,573
Do you think there was anything
to the first three who got

533
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,576
knocked out of this game?
Sean was clearly marked.

534
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,704
You were next and Kathy.
Boom, boom, boom.

535
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:07,290
Is that just the way this game
goes, or did you reflect upon

536
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:11,085
that and think, "Hmm?"
>> Jeff, I definitely reflected

537
00:36:11,168 --> 00:36:14,422
upon that because it seemed to
me to be a little bit of

538
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,925
gloating as people were staying
in the game and going on,

539
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:21,762
and it was apparent to several
of us, and at that point, alarms

540
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:25,224
started going off in all of our
heads.

541
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,393
>> PROBST: John, tell me about
the kiss.

542
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:30,938
You gave a Godfather kiss to
Sean as you went to do his third

543
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,940
one.
Sean received it, good-naturedly

544
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,776
and put it on his ass.
What was going on there?

545
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,321
>> Basically with me being the
mouthpiece and you're dead-on,

546
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,781
that's exactly what I was doing,
you know, just taunting.

547
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:44,118
We have a friendship with each
other where we understand that

548
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:47,413
we're playing the game, and that
nothing is meant seriously.

549
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:50,041
We have no hard feelings toward
each other at all.

550
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,627
>> PROBST: Paschal, for you,
what's the objective of this

551
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,128
game?
You've been out here now 24

552
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:56,297
days.
>> Well, from my point of view,

553
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,926
the objective when I came in
here was to be as honest as I

554
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,595
could be, given the framework of
the game.

555
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:06,390
And I'm one of the people that
really didn't start playing the

556
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,976
game until very late.
I think I started maybe playing

557
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,646
today, as a matter of fact.
>> PROBST: How about for you,

558
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,606
John?
>> I came into the game wanting

559
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:16,984
to be, you know, Mr. Integrity,
Mr. Honesty.

560
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,154
And then you start building
alliances and you start doing

561
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:23,491
things, and then there is doubt
about what other people are

562
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,661
saying or doing.
I don't think I, like, flat out

563
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,996
lied.
I think I've adapted to the half

564
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,959
truths and all that, and I've
done my share of them, you know,

565
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:36,963
and I wish I hadn't, but at this
point, it just seems to be part

566
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,798
of the game.
>> PROBST: Sean, if you get

567
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,841
voted out tonight, are you proud
of how you've played?

568
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,719
>> I'm proud 100%.
I haven't lied to one person in

569
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,930
this game.
The people I kept my word to,

570
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,890
I've kept my word to up to this
point.

571
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:50,309
For me, integrity is definitely
important.

572
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:53,020
Stand for something or you'll
fall for anything.

573
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,523
So stand up for what you
believe, even if it means

574
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,025
getting kicked out.
>> PROBST: Okay, immunity.

575
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,195
Tammy, you're wearing it.
You own it.

576
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:03,322
You can keep it.
You can certainly give it away.

577
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,573
What are you going to do with
it?

578
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:07,994
>> When I went into the immunity
challenge today, I didn't give a

579
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:11,038
(bleep) whether I won or lost
because I wasn't worried about

580
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:15,167
my position in the tribe.
But I hold this thing in high

581
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:19,380
respect now, and I realize how
valuable it is.

582
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,717
>> PROBST: So you're keeping it.
Okay, you guys are about to get

583
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,177
ready to vote out the first
person that will be a member of

584
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,013
the jury.
From here on out, you're going

585
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,849
to vote people out of this game
and then turn around and ask

586
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:32,560
them to come back and vote for
you to give you $1 million.

587
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:36,522
Very, very tough game to play.
It is time to vote.

588
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:46,574
Paschal, you're first.
>> You told me today you can't

589
00:38:46,657 --> 00:39:09,055
Paschal, you're first.
>> You told me today you can't

590
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,432
wait for a shower, a meal and a
good bed.

591
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,726
We'll be hanging at NYC
eating good soon.

592
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:23,778
Later, bro.
>> You've been better the last

593
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:44,465
Later, bro.
>> You've been better the last

594
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,551
few days, but I still don't feel
like you pull your weight around

595
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:57,603
the camp.
>> Checkmate, brother.

596
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:15,996
the camp.
>> Checkmate, brother.

597
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,834
You thought you had me.
Any time you go to Vegas, bet on

598
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,669
black.
We're definitely going to have

599
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:28,217
chicken and waffles when this
whole thing is done.

600
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,179
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.

601
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,983
Once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

602
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,193
The person will be asked to
leave the Tribal Council area

603
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:51,323
immediately.
I'll read the votes.

604
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:58,706
First vote: Sean.
Sean.

605
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:10,009
Two votes Sean.
John.

606
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,052
John.
It's two votes Sean;

607
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:24,064
two votes John.
Three votes John.

608
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:31,989
We're tied: three votes John,
three votes Sean.

609
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:39,246
That's four votes John.
The eighth person voted out,

610
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,290
the first member of our jury:
John.

611
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:51,383
No need to read the last vote.
John, the tribe has spoken.

612
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:57,723
No need to read the last vote.
John, the tribe has spoken.

613
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:03,312
>> Okeydoke.
>> PROBST: It's time for you to

614
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:07,858
go.
Good night.

615
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:21,121
Just when you think you have
this game figured out, whoops,

616
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,958
surprise.
This game is up for grabs.

617
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:27,461
You guys can head back to camp.
I'll see you tomorrow.

618
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,559
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

619
00:42:45,562 --> 00:42:46,480
>> PROBST: Next time on
<i>Survivor:</i>

620
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:49,525
John's departure marks a new era
at Soliantu.

621
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,151
>> It's a new day we're starting
here!

622
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,654
>> PROBST: Friends become bitter
enemies.

623
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,322
>> From the get-go I didn't like
you.

624
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,991
>> I have changed my opinion of
Zoe.

625
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,951
Zoe's a bitch.
>> PROBST: And two lucky

626
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:01,620
survivors get away from it all.
Now for the reward:

627
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:11,839
an authentic Marquesan feast.
>> Well, well, well.

628
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,216
So I'm the first member of the
jury.

629
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,635
I'm going to go eat really good
food.

630
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,346
My abs are incredible.
I wish I could have done a

631
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,016
little bit better.
You won't be able to retire,

632
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,309
Mom.
I'm sorry.

633
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:26,520
But, um, but I made the game and
I made the jury and I just...

634
00:43:26,603 --> 00:43:30,816
I did really well and I'm very
proud of myself.
