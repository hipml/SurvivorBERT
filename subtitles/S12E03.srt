>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,086
<i>Survivor:</i>

3
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,255
>> No more torrential downpours,

4
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:06,214
Sir God!

5
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:07,215
>> PROBST: Shane was unraveling.

6
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:08,216
>> There's no reason for me to

7
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:10,260
be doing this.

8
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,136
>> Green sweats.

9
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,430
>> PROBST: In a schoolyard pick,

10
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,557
the four tribes became two--

11
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,976
La Mina and Casaya.

12
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,185
When Bruce was not chosen, he

13
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,854
was sent to Exile Island and an

14
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:23,064
unexpected twist was revealed.

15
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:23,440
You are the only

16
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,608
person guaranteed to be safe

17
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,777
at the next Tribal Council.

18
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,154
>> Yeah! Thank you!

19
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:29,612
>> PROBST: Well, go.

20
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,156
Boat's out there.

21
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,991
Then the two tribes competed for

22
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,409
fishing gear.

23
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:35,326
Survivors ready!

24
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,703
Go!

25
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,121
In a tough physical challenge,

26
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,831
Nick helped carry La Mina to

27
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:40,999
victory.

28
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:43,501
La Mina wins reward!

29
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:44,669
When the new Casaya tribe

30
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:45,754
reached their beach, Shane

31
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,797
wasted no time.

32
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:48,715
>> Let's just the four of us, go

33
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:49,841
to the four-- done!

34
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:52,218
Shane, Courtney, Danielle and

35
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,512
Aras formed an alliance of four.

36
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,263
>> The people that don't talk

37
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,181
and communicate, they're the

38
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,433
ones that get voted off.

39
00:00:58,516 --> 00:00:59,559
>> PROBST: At La Mina...

40
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,769
>> You have my word.

41
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:01,811
>> PROBST: ...Austin and Nick

42
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:02,979
were torn between the older men

43
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:04,689
and the younger women.

44
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:05,523
>> We were thinking, if the four

45
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,775
of us stuck together, we would

46
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,151
have the numbers.

47
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,235
>> We are right in the middle of

48
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,403
a tug-of-war.

49
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,112
Somebody's gonna have to get

50
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,739
hurt out here.

51
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:13,364
>> PROBST: And Sally lost the

52
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,742
tribe's new spear.

53
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:16,534
>> I have some bad news: I lost

54
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,328
that spear.

55
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,163
>> PROBST: On Exile Island,

56
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,498
Bruce toughed it out.

57
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,540
(karate yell)

58
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,249
(thunder crashes)

59
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,250
>> This place is horrible, evil.

60
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,168
I would not wish this on my

61
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:28,713
worst enemy.

62
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:29,297
>> PROBST: At the immunity

63
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,549
challenge, Terry lead La Mina to

64
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:31,800
victory.

65
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,427
Terry-- pulling that anchor in!

66
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,222
La Mina wins immunity.

67
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,015
Back at Casaya, Shane made a

68
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:43,144
startling announcement.

69
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,187
>> Hey, what are you doing?

70
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,606
>> If somebody wants to quit,

71
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,399
let 'em quit!

72
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,734
>> PROBST: But at the last

73
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,110
minute, Aras managed to change

74
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,320
Shane's mind...

75
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,030
>> Just try it, okay?

76
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:54,447
>> Okay. All right.

77
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,198
>> PROBST: ...and the focus

78
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,366
shifted to Cirie and Melinda.

79
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,367
>> I don't care which one of you

80
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,410
goes, like whoever doesn't go

81
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:03,039
now, is going next.

82
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:04,332
>> PROBST: At Tribal Council,

83
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,042
Bruce returned from Exile Island

84
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,710
and listened in as Casaya's

85
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,004
emotions ran high.

86
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,131
>> I was done; I wanted out of

87
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,215
here.

88
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,341
It's some kind of psychotic, bad

89
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,593
idea.

90
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,511
>> It bothers me when

91
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:17,762
somebody, even remotely, had the

92
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,430
thought to quit, and you have me

93
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:22,475
here trying my best to stay.

94
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,643
>> PROBST: Despite her pleas,

95
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:24,310
Melinda was the first person

96
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,353
voted out of the new Casaya

97
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,897
tribe.

98
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,441
Melinda, the tribe has spoken.

99
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,111
Bruce, drop your buff, join your

100
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,946
new tribe, Casaya.

101
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:37,073
Fourteen are left.

102
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:41,161
Who will be voted out tonight?

103
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,161
Captioning sponsored by

104
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,079

(theme song playing)

107
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:07,937
>> Welcome, Bruce.

108
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,147
>> Bruce, welcome.

109
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,023
>> Oh, thank you.

110
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:10,607
>> At Tribal Council, we voted

111
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,734
off Melinda, and Bruce, who had

112
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:13,985
been sent to Exile Island came

113
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:14,527
back and was inserted into

114
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,530
Melinda's place in our tribe at

115
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,365
the end of Tribal Council.

116
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,370
>> Oh, it's close.

117
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,330
>> You don't need fire right

118
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,581
now.

119
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:27,498
You want water or you want fire?

120
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,625
You want water.

121
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,459
>> Okay, you have a pot full of

122
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,628
water, or bottles filled with

123
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,796
old water...

124
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,380
When I arrived tonight, I saw

125
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,799
my new tribe, and I can see they

126
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,383
all had good hearts and fought

127
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,470
to get here, but they're all

128
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,346
tired and lack of water.

129
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:44,140
They didn't have fire.

130
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:46,142
They really needed all my skills

131
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:46,476
and knowledge.

132
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,519
>> We just thought we were

133
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,145
making a fire so we could boil

134
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:50,063
the water, and we're gonna

135
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:50,855
drink the water.

136
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:51,481
>> No, you don't need to.

137
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,608
>> What do you mean?

138
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,446
>> So this is what we're gonna

139
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:01,658
do: I need a...

140
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,659
I've been teaching high school,

141
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,662
34 years, karate 40 years, and

142
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,330
taught backpacking for 19.

143
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:07,830
I know how to deal with

144
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,582
different kinds of profiles of

145
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,459
people, and there are some...

146
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,378
six different profiles right

147
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,254
here, let me tell you.

148
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,172
We're going to filter water

149
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:17,340
through three T-shirts,

150
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,508
double-layer.

151
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,426
It's going to be 90% pure water.

152
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,638
>> Bruce is incredibly neurotic.

153
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:24,472
You know, anytime anyone brings

154
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,432
something up, Bruce has been

155
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,475
doing it for 25 years and is

156
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,310
certified and a teacher.

157
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,353
I mean, of course, it grates on

158
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,312
my nerves-- I just want him to

159
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,439
shut up.

160
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,732
But it's like I... you know, I

161
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:38,528
gotta just let him do his thing.

162
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,656
>> Bruce came through with this

163
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:42,699
filtering system that somehow we

164
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,658
all just believed.

165
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:44,367
I don't even know if it's

166
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:44,617
accurate.

167
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,286
I mean, we just went for it.

168
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,287
>> Oh, listen to that beautiful

169
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,789
sound.

170
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,749
We missed a lot but that's okay.

171
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,959
>> So you really think...

172
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,210
I mean, I have to tell you, I've

173
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:55,837
also worked in wilderness and

174
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,921
I'm shocked and awed that this

175
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,423
method actually gets bacteria

176
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,091
out of the water.

177
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:00,842
>> It won't get all of it out,

178
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:01,384
but...

179
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,469
>> Yeah, it won't.

180
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,554
>> Bruce told us about his

181
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,014
filtration method, which he said

182
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,056
makes the water 90% pure.

183
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,683
And he was drinking it, and he

184
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,727
was fine-- he survived.

185
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,020
So we're a lot more powerful

186
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,604
as a tribe with him in Melinda's

187
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,481
place than we were.

188
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,065
>> Okay. Now I watch out for

189
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,483
you, right?

190
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,943
>> Yes, Bruce.

191
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,028
>> The tribe reacted to me with

192
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:20,403
great joy.

193
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,071
They thought I was a gift from

194
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,781
heaven.

195
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,033
They were just very ecstatic

196
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,409
that I was there.

197
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,494
This is the best bottle so far.

198
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,830
I know that I was the last man

199
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:31,497
picked.

200
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,582
Now I'm emerging as the top of

201
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:53,936
the tribe.

202
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,522
>> Hey, guys, are we doing

203
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,523
shells and everything?

204
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,359
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

205
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,445
>> We've been eating very

206
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,490
little.

207
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,533
Some stew made out of snails and

208
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,870
crab legs, but nothing much to

209
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,371
speak of.

210
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,832
>> So any gooey part's okay?

211
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,959
>> I'm eating all of it.

212
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,878
>> Is there water?

213
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,421
Here, here's water.

214
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,006
>> Oh, yeah.

215
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,591
I'm not doing snails.

216
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,802
>> We're just slowly going

217
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,678
downhill.

218
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,305
Another day or two, I don't know

219
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:30,681
what kind of shape people are

220
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,934
going to be in around here.

221
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,060
Right now, I mean if we could

222
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,103
catch a few fish a day, even two

223
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:35,937
fish a day, we'd be a in a whole

224
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,647
other ballgame.

225
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,403
The equipment that we have

226
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:48,116
for fishing is very old-school,

227
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,033
very medieval, and the knowledge

228
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,119
on our part is as minimal as it

229
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,495
could be.

230
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,289
He's on. He's on...

231
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,541
He's on.

232
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,501
Aw, shoot!

233
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,502
Oh!

234
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,381
>> Aw, no!

235
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,006
>> That damn spear that Sally

236
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:04,632
lost-- God, what we wouldn't

237
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,468
give to have that thing back.

238
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:16,435
How did you lose that spear?

239
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,771
>> Yee-ha!

240
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,565
Oh, he's a nice one.

241
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:23,401
There we are, boys.

242
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,694
It's fish.

243
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,529
It's a puffer thing.

244
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,740
It's kind of freaky.

245
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:33,161
That is a freaky, freaky thing.

246
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,537
Right around camp, the fish

247
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,080
population seems to consist of

248
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:36,664
nothing but poisonous puffer

249
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,416
fish, which we've caught in

250
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,293
droves.

251
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,252
So it's not like we're

252
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,003
not catching fish; we're just

253
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,797
catching the ones we can't eat.

254
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:45,923
To spend two or three hours out

255
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,008
there, when you could be doing

256
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,384
things around camp to help

257
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:49,802
everybody, and you, like, come

258
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,429
back empty-handed is getting

259
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:52,722
really old.

260
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,891
>> Yee-ha!

261
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,350
>> Oh, there he is.

262
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,476
Hey, that's a good little fat

263
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,519
fish.

264
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:58,811
>> Good job.

265
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,771
>> Oh, thanks.

266
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,440
>> Terry, the sole provider of

267
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:05,902
this tribe came up with Nemo--

268
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:06,819
that's right, I'm talking a fish

269
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,654
about yea big.

270
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,615
We have applauded that fish as

271
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,618
if he caught a 14-pound catfish.

272
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,203
We were so excited about that

273
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,037
damn thing, I don't even know

274
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,705
how to talk about it.

275
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,040
>> Come on, mama.

276
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:19,832
>> Oh, you can feel the meat in

277
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:20,583
here.

278
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,709
>> Mmm.

279
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:22,793
There was a lot of meat on that

280
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:23,836
little guy, or maybe it just

281
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,712
felt like a lot because we

282
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,298
haven't had meat in so long.

283
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,382
If we can catch a couple more of

284
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,383
those every day, that would just

285
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,552
be unbelievable.

286
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,887
>> Potato on that.

287
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:40,978
>> Yeah.

288
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,815
>> PROBST: La Mina, come on in.

289
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:52,657
Casaya, come on in.

290
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,245
La Mina, getting your first look

291
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,121
at the new Casaya.

292
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,082
Melinda voted out at the last

293
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,625
Tribal Council.

294
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,085
Bruce joined the tribe,

295
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,753
returning from Exile Island.

296
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:06,796
So, you guys physically look

297
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,048
better.

298
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:09,632
>> I feel a hell of a lot

299
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:10,633
better.

300
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:11,801
>> We've got Bruce with us...

301
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,261
>> Bruce is a savior.

302
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,011
>> PROBST: How is Bruce the

303
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:14,971
savior?

304
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:15,721
>> The first thing we noticed

305
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:16,681
was the, you know, the upbeat

306
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:17,848
attitude.

307
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:18,766
You can't help but feel better

308
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:19,725
from being around him.

309
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:20,309
Plus, his knowledge took a lot

310
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,353
of the, uh, the actual effort

311
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,729
and expenditure of energy off of

312
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:24,939
us, because he was willing to

313
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,232
take the lead on everything.

314
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,858
>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

315
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:28,985
to today's challenge?

316
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:29,235
>> Yeah.

317
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:29,735
>> Let's get it on.

318
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:30,653
>> PROBST: It is for reward,

319
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,737
and here's how it works.

320
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:32,655
Three tribe members will be the

321
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,781
launchers.

322
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,033
Each launcher will get two shots

323
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,452
per round, the other four tribe

324
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,912
members will stand on a balance

325
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,914
beam over the water.

326
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,374
On my "Go," one tribe member

327
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,500
will launch a ball; the other

328
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,877
four will try to catch it.

329
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,337
You can jump off the balance

330
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,588
beam to catch the ball, but if

331
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,214
you go in the water, you got to

332
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,966
come up with the ball in order

333
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,384
to score a point.

334
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,385
First tribe to five wins reward.

335
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,262
Want to know what you're playing

336
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:56,887
for?

337
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,139
>> Yeah.

338
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:58,681
>> PROBST: You're gonna want

339
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,975
this stuff.

340
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,852
Tarp, lanterns, some fuel,

341
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,313
couple of blankets, some

342
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,856
pillows, jerry cans for water,

343
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,649
and some rope.

344
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,984
That's for the winners.

345
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:10,776
>> Excellent.

346
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,194
>> PROBST: For the losers, one

347
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,029
tribe member will be sent to

348
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,740
Exile Island.

349
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:16,741
Big enough stakes?

350
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:17,742
>> Yeah.

351
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:18,743
>> PROBST: All right, La Mina,

352
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,995
who's gonna be the three

353
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,163
launchers?

354
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,540
>> Me, Dan and Ruth Marie.

355
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:25,583
>> PROBST: Misty, Dan, Ruth

356
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,084
Marie will be the launchers, the

357
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,419
other four will be on the perch.

358
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,462
Casaya, who's gonna be the three

359
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,713
launchers?

360
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,465
>> Bob, Bruce and Cirie.

361
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,090
>> PROBST: Bob, Bruce and Cirie

362
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,384
will be the launchers, the other

363
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,552
four will be the catchers.

364
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:38,596
Let's get going.

365
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,433
First shooters...

366
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,267
>> All right, Bob.

367
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,603
>> PROBST: ...Bobby and Misty.

368
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:50,649
Ready... aim...

369
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,485
fire at will.

370
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,112
Terry scores for La Mina!

371
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,490
>> Nice one!

372
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:58,699
>> Come on, Bob.

373
00:10:58,783 --> 00:10:59,909
That's good, Bobby, that's good,

374
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:00,242
Bobby, get it!

375
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,327
Aras, get...

376
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,953
>> PROBST: Oh, Aras gave it a

377
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:03,162
shot.

378
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,206
Misty and Bobby, taking their

379
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:05,790
second shots.

380
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,834
La Mina leads, one, zero.

381
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,338
Ready, aim, release.

382
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,923
Bobby in the air.

383
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,633
Aras makes a great catch for

384
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:16,425
Casaya.

385
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,844
>> (cheering)

386
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,346
>> PROBST: Terry can't handle

387
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:20,846
it, but Nick does.

388
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,224
>> (cheering)

389
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,517
>> PROBST: La Mina leads two,

390
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,102
one.

391
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,937
That fell right into your lap.

392
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,772
A lot of luck for La Mina.

393
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,857
Nice work for Casaya.

394
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,776
Here we go, next two shooters.

395
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,821
Dan and Bruce.

396
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:37,947
Take your spots.

397
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,200
La Mina leads, two, one.

398
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,952
Ready, aim, and release.

399
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,245
>> Hit it!

400
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,037
>> PROBST: Bruce right on

401
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,831
target, Danielle with a great

402
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:50,334
catch for Casaya.

403
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,128
Terry comes up with the third

404
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,963
point for La Mina.

405
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,842
La Mina leads, three, two.

406
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,386
Bruce trying to catch Casaya up.

407
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,804
Dan looking to put them ahead.

408
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,015
Ready, aim, release.

409
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,143
Shane makes a leap and comes up

410
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,186
with it.

411
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,312
La Mina's ball sails long, and

412
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,856
we are tied, three, three.

413
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,358
Next shooters.

414
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,360
Cirie up for Casaya.

415
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:16,986
Ruth-Marie launching for La

416
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,238
Mina.

417
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:19,780
>> Go, hot mama!

418
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:20,322
>> PROBST: Take your spots.

419
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,116
>> Back a few inches, back...

420
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,409
see back on Bruce, right

421
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:23,617
there?

422
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,660
>> PROBST: Cirie getting some

423
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:25,202
help from Bobby.

424
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,245
>> There you go, right there.

425
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,331
>> PROBST: Ready, aim, release.

426
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,001
Ruth-Marie hits nothing.

427
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:32,835
>> Get it!

428
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:33,961
>> PROBST: Shane with another

429
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,337
nice catch for Casaya.

430
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,505
>> Yeah!

431
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,798
>> PROBST: Casaya is on a roll.

432
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,884
>> Great catch, Shane!

433
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,636
>> (cheering)

434
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,929
>> PROBST: Casaya now leads

435
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,682
four, three.

436
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:47,933
Ruth-Marie, Cirie, take your

437
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,811
spots.

438
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,814
Casaya could win it right here.

439
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:57,735
Ready, aim, release.

440
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,028
Both balls in the air.

441
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,362
Terry makes it.

442
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,656
Unbelievable catch!

443
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,158
Aras can't handle it.

444
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,744
We're tied four, four.

445
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,037
This next point could do it for

446
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,413
either tribe.

447
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,039
Nobody wants to go to Exile

448
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:13,125
Island.

449
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,002
For reward, here we go.

450
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,880
Misty and Bobby.

451
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:23,052
>> Come on, Bob.

452
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:27,056
>> PROBST: Ready, aim...

453
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,016
release.

454
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,060
Misty is in the air, it's

455
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:31,936
blowing hard.

456
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,687
Terry has it!

457
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,231
Shane can't come up with it for

458
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,482
Casaya.

459
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,858
La Mina wins reward!

460
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,902
>> Yeah!

461
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,029
>> (cheering)

462
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,156
>> Great catch!

463
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,951
>> Woo!

464
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:50,412
>> Woo!

465
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,705
>> PROBST: Here's how it's going

466
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,332
to work: Casaya, one of your

467
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,625
tribe members is now going to

468
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,626
Exile Island.

469
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,877
They will return for the next

470
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,379
immunity challenge.

471
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,047
La Mina, as winners of this

472
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,882
challenge, this time you decide

473
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,092
who you want to send to Exile

474
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,553
Island.

475
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,680
>> We have to decide...?

476
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,102
>> We have to send Bruce.

477
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,229
>> Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

478
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:15,896
>> Yeah.

479
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,939
>> PROBST: All right, La Mina,

480
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,232
who is it going to be?

481
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,525
Who are you sending to Exile

482
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,943
Island?

483
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,528
>> They made a very detrimental

484
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,405
move by telling us who brought

485
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,323
back the team morale over there.

486
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,952
Bruce, we're sending him back.

487
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:32,871
>> These guys are playing for

488
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:33,163
keeps, huh?

489
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:33,956
>> PROBST: So, Bruce, you will

490
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,833
return to Exile Island.

491
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,042
You'll come back to this game

492
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,669
for the next immunity challenge.

493
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:42,131
See you when you get back.

494
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,475
Casaya, I've got nothing else

495
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:53,726
for you.

496
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,644
Grab your stuff, head on out.

497
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,355
La Mina, reward is yours.

498
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,066
Get it and head on back to camp.

499
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,499
>> Sweet spoils, you guys.

500
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,167
>> That's right.

501
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:18,834
>> Oh, yeah.

502
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:19,376
>> Very happy for that, kid.

503
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,045
>> I know it's not food, but

504
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,422
this is so awesome!

505
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,882
>> The reward challenge, uh,

506
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,300
this afternoon was won by La

507
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,218
Mina, and what we got for it was

508
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:28,969
a tarp, which basically

509
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,221
reinforces the great shelter

510
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,306
we've got already.

511
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,016
We've got two huge canisters for

512
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,517
carrying water.

513
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,143
We got a couple of blankets, a

514
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,144
couple pillows and we got

515
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:40,314
kerosene, so we have constant

516
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,398
fire.

517
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,108
I'm really stoked for my team.

518
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,568
It was a total team effort.

519
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,654
It was great.

520
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:48,405
>> It's not too short, you can

521
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,157
get, and-and you know, you need

522
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,450
to extend over the sides a

523
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,576
little bit, too.

524
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,160
Yeah, there you go.

525
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,162
Fortunately, the shelter was

526
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,163
designed for a tarp, so it went

527
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,165
up and over pretty easily.

528
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,958
>> Nice.

529
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:00,459
>> We have a nice domed

530
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,753
interior, as opposed to a

531
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,004
slumping interior, so there's

532
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,381
lots of space inside.

533
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,090
Check it out.

534
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,216
>> Sweet!

535
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:16,225
(thundering)

536
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,185
>> Our tarp came just in time

537
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,521
for the big rain that just

538
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:24,191
started pouring down.

539
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,193
It was torrential.

540
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:29,279
I mean, it was coming down hard.

541
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:38,956
>> Yeah, have a moment for him.

542
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,999
>> That guy is so hurtin'.

543
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,835
The decision to send Bruce to

544
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,795
Exile Island was a tough one,

545
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,922
but he is an asset to that team,

546
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:48,257
and without Bruce, we think

547
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,800
they're not gonna be up on their

548
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,135
feet as they should be.

549
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,929
So, um, we made a tough call,

550
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:56,974
and, uh, I wouldn't want to be

551
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:57,433
him.

552
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:49,401
(thundering)

553
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,861
>> Did you guys boil that water

554
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:51,445
yet?

555
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,906
>> It's on right now.

556
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,741
>> We lost the challenge, and

557
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,327
the other team chose Bruce to go

558
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,287
to Exile Island, which I thought

559
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,830
was one of the most evil things

560
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,248
I've ever seen people do.

561
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,167
It doesn't have that much grip.

562
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,753
I don't know if this is going

563
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,088
to work.

564
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,882
I mean, to lose the reward, and

565
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,842
then to deal with losing Bruce

566
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,512
in that way, it just put us all

567
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,597
on a downer, and it's like the

568
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,683
last thing we need right now.

569
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:32,027
>> That's your time-out stone.

570
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,320
>> It's mine for the rest of

571
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,196
the, please actually, could no

572
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,323
one else sit on my thinking

573
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,909
seat, please?

574
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,994
>> Why does it have to be yours?

575
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:41,495
>> Because I picked it!

576
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,247
You want this one, I'll go get

577
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,415
another one!

578
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,042
I want one!

579
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,001
This one!

580
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:48,418
>> Okay.

581
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,962
>> If you want this one, I'll go

582
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:50,379
get another one!

583
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,840
I just want mine!

584
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,258
This one!

585
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,010
>> I think the problems in our

586
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,428
tribe are inherent in the

587
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,221
personalities.

588
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,431
I'm in an alliance with three

589
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,808
nutballs, I feel like, at this

590
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,310
point.

591
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,603
>> It looks like it's going to

592
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:06,812
fall.

593
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,105
>> I know.

594
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,398
>> Can we just adjust it?

595
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,400
>> Well, I want to but I'm just

596
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,609
trying to figure it out.

597
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,153
Shane, what do you think?

598
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,487
>> I don't know, you got us

599
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,198
here, so I left it up to you.

600
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:18,574
You got us here.

601
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,534
>> I know, I asked for your help

602
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,827
so we could work together, but

603
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,953
it's all right.

604
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,496
>> With Courtney and Shane, it's

605
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,415
always something.

606
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,458
The funny thing is these are the

607
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,252
people that you guys decided to

608
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,253
align with, and now you hate

609
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,672
each other, so how stupid is

610
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,591
that?

611
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,175
>> Can I do this?

612
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,760
>> Please, oh, I'd love it.

613
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,303
That would make me so happy.

614
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:43,599
Thanks, please.

615
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,766
I don't think it's strong

616
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,851
enough.

617
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:46,935
You do?

618
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:47,352
Go ahead, go ahead.

619
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,771
>> You're out of your mind, man.

620
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,982
You are crazy.

621
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,860
>> I'm just sharing an opinion.

622
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:58,530
Will you relax? I just...

623
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:01,408
I don't know what his problem

624
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,577
is.

625
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,328
I'm, I'm not kidding.

626
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,413
This is, like, not even funny

627
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,331
right now.

628
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,373
I-I did nothing.

629
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,666
Did I just do anything wrong?

630
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,709
>> Don't worry about it.

631
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,336
>> I can't even say anything, of

632
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,337
advice or anything.

633
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,338
I just wanted his help.

634
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,340
I'm feeling really frustrated

635
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,342
right now.

636
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,093
I don't know, I feel like Shane

637
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,720
needs to, like, get his angst

638
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,305
out on something or someone, and

639
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,890
he's chosen me.

640
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:25,474
I'm really bummed about the

641
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,351
situation.

642
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,019
>> Just let him go.

643
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,354
>> Well, I don't like to be the

644
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,647
one that he's decided to pick

645
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,108
on, with his mood.

646
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,860
>> Courtney is a lunatic, and

647
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,196
I'm trapped with her because I

648
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,530
made a commitment on my son's

649
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,157
life that I would stay with her.

650
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,451
I just don't know how to get

651
00:20:44,534 --> 00:21:08,308
right with her.

652
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,936
>> With you two and us two kind

653
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,062
of watching each other's backs,

654
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:12,688
I think we can go really far.

655
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,564
>> Yeah. I'd like to be with you

656
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,649
all.

657
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,859
>> Cool, 'cause we like you.

658
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,111
>> Sounds like a plan I'd like

659
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,237
to work out myself.

660
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,196
>> Let's do it.

661
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:22,823
>> Sally has been really working

662
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:23,407
hard on trying to get Nick and

663
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,492
Austin to kind of pair with us,

664
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,828
'cause it seemed like there

665
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:28,704
might be a little bit of a
boys'

666
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:29,496
club going on around here.

667
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,331
Would you like your shoulders

668
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:31,540
rubbed?

669
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,166
>> Yeah.

670
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,751
>> Okay, just sit there.

671
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:35,335
Oh.

672
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,629
I'm a natural flirt.

673
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,047
That's something I just enjoy

674
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:39,923
doing.

675
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,550
Some people are born with it.

676
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,010
(laughs)

677
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,387
I would flirt to help get ahead.

678
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,848
I didn't come out here to sit on

679
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:48,765
my rump.

680
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:49,391
I came out here to have a good

681
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:53,103
time and play the game.

682
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,022
>> Amazing, right this second.

683
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,649
>> I think Misty is such a smart

684
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,235
girl, and I think she comes

685
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:01,278
across in this just, like,

686
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,779
nice... "Like, I want to massage

687
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:03,739
everybody."

688
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,614
But you know there's a little

689
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,907
extra something going into

690
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:06,575
Austin and Nick's massages.

691
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,244
>> Is there a teacher, Misty, or

692
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:10,287
is this just your natural,

693
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:10,662
evolved method?

694
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,372
>> It's my natural, evolved

695
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,665
method.

696
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:14,791
Is it working?

697
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:15,709
>> I think it is.

698
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:16,752
>> Okay.

699
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:17,711
>> We work well together, 'cause

700
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,212
she has, like, that southern,

701
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,380
kind of flirty charm, and I'm

702
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,548
just, like, the pal, you know?

703
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,425
Like, "What's up, guys?

704
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,468
Let's hang out."

705
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,844
I think between the two of us,

706
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:26,803
we're doing okay.

707
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,597
>> Look, man, if we get into

708
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,515
this four strong into the merge,

709
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,516
we're already ahead.

710
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,517
Then can we pretend like we're

711
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,228
weak-- "Oh, weak ladies.

712
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:35,854
We just want to go as far as we

713
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,773
can."

714
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,232
I mean, I don't think it's going

715
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,108
to come to that, 'cause they're

716
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,109
smart guys, but...

717
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:41,985
>> You're so cute.

718
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:42,986
I mean, you're, like, "Come on.

719
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:43,987
We're just little girls."

720
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:44,988
>> We're just little girls.

721
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:45,989
>> "We just want to get as far

722
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:49,076
as we can."

723
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,166
>> I am in a position that I

724
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,334
didn't necessarily want to be

725
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,543
in.

726
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,921
I'm the one that everybody's

727
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:01,963
kind of come to, saying, "Hey,

728
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,131
we really trust you.

729
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,425
Um, we need you on our side."

730
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,551
It could be construed as very

731
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,512
dangerous to align yourself with

732
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,180
strong guys, especially when I

733
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,973
have two girls who seem to

734
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:12,974
really trust me and-and think

735
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,977
that I'm a really good guy.

736
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:16,812
>> How are we doing here?

737
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,855
>> Good job.

738
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,607
>> My goal is to keep working on

739
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,067
Austin and to keep, you know,

740
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,318
showing him that as much as

741
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:25,112
possible, Terry is a power

742
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:25,987
player, and he's going to have

743
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,280
a huge mark on his back, and it

744
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,740
might be wiser for those guys to

745
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:29,741
align themselves with us in case

746
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:30,742
they make it to the merge.

747
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:31,743
They're going to need us.

748
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:38,792
We'll see what happens.

749
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,878
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

750
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,509
We'll now bring in Bruce, once

751
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,928
again returning from Exile

752
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,054
Island.

753
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:51,555
>> Boy, Bruce!

754
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,141
>> Let's go.

755
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,226
>> Bring it back.

756
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,690
>> Nice to have you back...

757

Dan, say good-bye.

762
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,494
Immunity, back up for grabs.

763
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:17,164
Today's challenge is going to be

764
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:20,542
a physical, head-to-head battle.

765
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,169
There are five circles in the

766
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,378
sand.

767
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:24,963
Buried within each circle is a

768
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,214
bag.

769
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,674
On my go, you'll race out to the

770
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:30,051
circle, dig and find the bag,

771
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,303
and then get back to your finish

772
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,304
mat.

773
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:33,221
That's where it's going to get

774
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:33,972
physical.

775
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,390
Both tribes will be battling for

776
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:36,808
the same bag.

777
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:37,809
To score, you got to have at

778
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,394
least one hand on the bag while

779
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:40,687
any part of your body touches

780
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,730
the finish mat.

781
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,523
First tribe to three wins

782
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,650

00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,611
Losers, somebody going home.

784
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:48,570
The matchups will vary from

785
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:49,654
round to round.

786
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,530
Drop your gear.

787
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:54,784
We'll get started.

today's loss was hard.

1056
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,427
It was hard because it was

1057
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,303
physical, and we gave it

1058
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:11,137
everything we had, and it was

1059
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,055
close.

1060
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,306
They have so much more weight

1061
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,015
than we do.

1062

1063

My goal was to bring this tribe

1066
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:19,520
intact to the merge, and now we

1067
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,773
got to make a tough decision.

1068
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,066
I'm bummed that we've got to

1069
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,485
lose one of our tribe mates, but

1070
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,028
the game moves on, and there's

1071
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:30,114
always tomorrow.

1072
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,220
>> Dan and I, as soon as we got

1073
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,680
the two younger guys, we got on

1074
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,683
them quickly and came up with

1075
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,935
who we're going to have to vote

1076
00:32:59,018 --> 00:32:59,227
off tonight.

1077
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,145
And the plan at Tribal Council

1078
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:06,192
tonight is to vote off Misty.

1079
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,068
She's an engineer.

1080
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,153
She's smart as hell.

1081
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,613
And she could cause some

1082
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,866
trouble.

1083
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,581
>> I would look at it

1084
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,749
personally and say Ruth Marie

1085
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:22,959
or Dan.

1086
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,211
I love Ruth Marie, but I just

1087
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,380
think down the road, as far as

1088
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,257
contribution, like Dan might

1089
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,883
not be the fastest guy, but look

1090
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,885
at him today, he did awesome.

1091
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:33,886
And he's so brilliant.

1092
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:34,887
He's so brilliant.

1093
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:35,388
>> I can't vote for Dan.

1094
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:38,558
>> Good, then that's easy.

1095
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:41,394
>> Yeah.

1096
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:42,812
>> If I take myself out of it

1097
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,063
and I say who is going to,

1098
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,232
like, who is going to

1099
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:47,150
contribute the most in all

1100
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,901
areas, Dan is high up on the

1101
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:49,902
list.

1102
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,904
>> Yeah.

1103
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:52,447
>> Ruth Marie is pretty weak

1104
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,157
right now.

1105
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,366
I mean, she's struggling.

1106
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,325
Like, she's been struggling for

1107
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,786
a couple days.

1108
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,370
Right now, I think it would be

1109
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,622
most advantageous to us as a

1110
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,791
tribe, and also to myself, for

1111
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,169
it to be Ruth Marie.

1112
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,880
(Dan sighs)

1113

1114
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,557
and a hard place, didn't you?

>> Yep.

1116
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,185
>> Yeah, it happens to me every

1117
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,061
day, bro.

1118
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,189
My two options I have,

1119
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,648
personally-- and when I say

1120
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,108
"personally" I'm linked to

1121
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,943
Nick-- we could either go with

1122
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,404
Sally and Misty, or we go with

1123
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,199
Dan and Terry.

1124
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,867
I have the makings right now to

1125
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,703
get all the way to where I want

1126
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,288
to be in this game because of

1127
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:45,541
the way that I'm aligned.

1128

00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,569
This is part of the ritual at

1133
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:14,821
Tribal Council because in this

1134
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,823
game, fire represents your life.

1135
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:17,990
As long as you have fire,

1136
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:18,991
you're in the game.

1137
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,284
When your fire is gone, so are

1138
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:23,329
you.

1139
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:25,998
So, catch me up.

1140
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,667
Terry, eight days out here,

1141
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,251
compared to the experiences

1142
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,628
you've had in life, where does

1143
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,213
this rank in terms of tough?

1144
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,464
>> It's definitely up there on

1145
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,298
the physical side.

1146
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,633
On the mental side, not there

1147
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,969
yet, I'm sure it will be.

1148
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,095
And I'm ready for what comes

1149
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:39,846
down the road.

1150
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,472
>> PROBST: How about you, Dan?

1151
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:42,682
You hanging in there?

1152
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:43,599
>> Oh, absolutely.

1153
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,976
There's certainly deprivation

1154
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,477
involved, and it's difficult to

1155
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,271
go many, many days without

1156
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,355
food, but the companionship is

1157
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,274
excellent.

1158
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,400
For strangers to come together

1159
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,359
and work together so well so

1160
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:56,195
fast, that's impressive.

1161
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,406
>> PROBST: Sally, how about the

1162
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:01,075
first eight days for you?

1163
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:02,493
>> The first eight days for me

1164
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,453
have been everything I thought

1165
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,329
they could be.

1166
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,748
Other than the fact that I

1167
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,624
didn't think I would come in

1168
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:09,250
here and actually care about

1169
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,252
these people as much as I could

1170
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,336
in eight days.

1171
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,796
>> PROBST: Austin, what's the

1172
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,423
food situation?

1173
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,841
>> The X factor, Terry caught a

1174
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:17,383
fish yesterday that was no

1175
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,301
bigger than this.

1176
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:21,053
But, man, when you haven't had

1177
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:21,637
any protein in days, that will

1178
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,389
do wonders for you.

1179
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:25,516
I am by no means a strong

1180
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,434
fisherman, and all we can catch

1181
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,144
are the puffer fish, which,

1182
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,812
those things are poisonous.

1183
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,188
So we just hadn't had any luck

1184
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:31,564
Jeff, it sucks.

1185
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:32,440
>> PROBST: Well, what are you

1186
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,399
doing with the spear?

1187
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,400
>> We had a little incident with

1188
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:36,861
the spear.

1189
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,321
We, uh... the spear hasn't been

1190
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:39,739
much luck for us, let's just put

1191
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:40,740
it that way.

1192
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,199
>> PROBST: Misty, looking at

1193
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,035
this tribe, it seems like,

1194
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:44,660
based on today, guys that are in

1195
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:45,453
pretty good shape.

1196
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,581
>> Oh, yeah.

1197
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:49,999
>> PROBST: Is there a pressure

1198
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:51,375
from the women that, "We have

1199
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,376
to live up to this"?

1200
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,336
>> I think in any situation

1201
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,253
when you've got a mixed group

1202
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:57,173
like this, there's always a

1203
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,549
pressure that we've got to step

1204
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,134
up to the plate and play just

1205
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:01,344
as well as the men are.

1206
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,012
>> PROBST: Do you truly think

1207
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,055
all seven people here are all

1208
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,182
playing for this tribe?

1209
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,516
>> I absolutely believe that,

1210
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,435
100%, wholeheartedly.

1211
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,353
And that's something I didn't

1212
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:10,978
expect coming into this game.

1213
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,480
I expected to have the little

1214
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,857
sects of people, you know,

1215
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:15,399
trying to pretend to pull

1216
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,442
together and make a team out of

1217
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:17,318
it, but we don't have that

1218
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,363
issue, we really are a team.

1219
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,281
>> PROBST: So, Terry, if you

1220
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:25,034
really are this unified, how do

1221
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:27,328
you make a vote tonight?

1222
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:27,828
Are people coming here and

1223
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:28,496
making individual votes and

1224
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,373
we'll just see what happens?

1225
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:32,250
>> Obviously, there's been some

1226
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:32,833
talk.

1227
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:33,584
It's all part of the game to

1228
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,002
talk to different people on

1229
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:35,586
what their feeling is, and we

1230
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,296
all understand that someone has

1231
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,591
to go tonight.

1232
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,676
>> PROBST: Ruth Marie, you're

1233
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,427
the only person in this tribe

1234
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,054
that came into this tribe

1235
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,347
without somebody.

1236
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,015
Did you feel that initially?

1237
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,183
>> I noticed that right away,

1238
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:52,061
Jeff, yeah, um...

1239
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,312
I'm definitely the odd man out.

1240
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,855
And it's a... it's a vulnerable

1241
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:58,150
seat to be in tonight.

1242
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:58,734
>> PROBST: How about for you,

1243
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,277
Nick?

1244
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,278
Are you basing your vote on

1245
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,905
what you think?

1246
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,074
You basing it on a group?

1247
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:05,992
>> I'm basing my vote on

1248
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,828
probably more... with a group

1249
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,329
tonight.

1250
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,455
There's conversations in camp.

1251
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,083
There's strategy being plotted.

1252
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,584
So, yeah, I think tonight more

1253
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,586
than individually, I'm going

1254
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,964
with the group.

1255
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:20,673
>> PROBST: Okay, there is one

1256
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,174
more thing to deal with, the

1257
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,218
hidden immunity idol.

1258
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:25,261
Misty, you're the only person

1259
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,262
from this tribe to go to Exile

1260
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,346
Island.

1261
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,265
If, after the vote, you have

1262
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,099
the most votes, that is when

1263
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,976
you would reveal whether or not

1264
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:32,393
you found the idol.

1265
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,646
Otherwise, it remains a mystery.

1266
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,397
Okay, it is time to vote.

1267
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,483
Austin, you're up.

1268
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,500
>> This is just team play.

1269
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,837
That's all.

1270
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,931
>> Misty, you're a smart girl.

1271
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:11,599
I wish it didn't have to be

1272
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,685
this way.

1273
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:26,447
>> I'm going with the strength

1274
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,824
of the tribe and we think that

1275
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:29,867
you're probably the least

1276
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,202
strong member of the tribe

1277
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:34,288
right now, and I'm very sorry.

1278
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,003
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1279
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:44,090
votes.

1280
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,723
>> PROBST: Once the votes are

1281
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,141
read, the decision is final.

1282
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:54,683
The person voted out will be

1283
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,435
asked to leave the Tribal

1284
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:56,977
Council area immediately.

1285
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:00,022
I'll read the votes.

1286
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,440
First vote...

1287
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:05,319
Ruth Marie.

1288
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:05,486
Misty.

1289
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,780
One vote Misty, one vote Ruth

1290
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:11,826
Marie.

1291
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:12,618
Ruth Marie.

1292
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:16,705
Two votes Ruth, one vote Misty.

1293
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,292
Misty.

1294
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,001
We're tied-- two votes Misty,

1295
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,964
two votes Ruth Marie.

1296
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,257
Misty.

1297
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,091
That's three votes Misty, two

1298
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:30,219
votes Ruth Marie.

1299
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,806
Third person voted out of

1300
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:34,640
<i>Survivor: Exile Island...</i>

1301
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,600
Misty.

1302
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,936
Misty, that's enough votes.

1303
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:39,895
One question left: Did you find

1304
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:43,274
the immunity idol?

1305
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,695
>> No, I did not.

1306
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:48,779
>> PROBST: You need to bring me

1307
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,866
your torch.

1308
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:01,167
Misty, the tribe has spoken.

1309
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,754
It's time for you to go.

1310
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:15,514
Well, based on what I

1311
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,434
heard tonight, it does seem like

1312
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:19,643
you're a very unified tribe.

1313
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,687
But as the vote tonight shows,

1314
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,398
even in the tightest of groups,

1315
00:41:24,481 --> 00:41:25,608

outside.

1317
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:28,235
Grab your torches, head on back

1318
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,904
to camp.

1319
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,906
Good night.

<i>Survivor:</i> La Mina is on the

1327
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,013
verge of starvation.

1328
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:56,847
>> Ten days in and we really

1329
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:57,806
haven't had anything to eat.

1330
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,099
>> I figure we got about three

1331
00:41:59,183 --> 00:41:59,642
more days before the entire

1332
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,769

discussion.

1338

the alliance of four.

1339
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:08,776
>> Everybody here won't tell

1340
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:09,777
you, they're afraid to tell you

1341
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,488
the truth.

1342
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:18,327
>> Well, tonight was definitely

1343
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,662
a shock to me.

1344
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,288
I didn't expect it so soon,

1345
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:21,747
that's for sure.

1346
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,291
I was excited, and exuberant,

1347
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,960
and I thought we had a great

1348
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:26,627
thing going, so obviously I was

1349
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,171
outplayed and out-strategized.

1350
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:29,755
I had a good time out here.

1351
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:32,508
I met some great, great people,

1352
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:33,509
and I wish my tribe all the

1353
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:33,884
luck.

1354
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,387
I hope they go all the way.
