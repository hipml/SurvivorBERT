Previously on Survivor:

2
00:00:02,468 --> 00:00:04,842
Maraamu found a new source of food...

3
00:00:05,883 --> 00:00:09,728
and won a crucial reward challenge
that allowed them to sack Rotu's camp.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,383
Maraamu, prepare to loot.

5
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:13,359
It was great. We took everything.

6
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:16,199
... and that brought Rotu even closer together.

7
00:00:16,273 --> 00:00:19,544
Everyone felt they had a role in the tribe.

8
00:00:19,659 --> 00:00:23,171
But the unit faltered
when John became suspicious of Gabe's behavior.

9
00:00:23,218 --> 00:00:24,179
Are we still united?

10
00:00:24,216 --> 00:00:24,863
Is that the deal?

11
00:00:24,905 --> 00:00:27,990
Little Maraamu also won her first immunity.

12
00:00:29,932 --> 00:00:32,022
And John did what was necessary to embarrass Gabe.

13
00:00:32,054 --> 00:00:33,165
Tomorrow we kick Gabe out.

14
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:37,839
Rotu went to his first Tribal Council,
where Rob followed the majority vote,

15
00:00:37,874 --> 00:00:39,276
although he had a message for John.

16
00:00:39,349 --> 00:00:40,717
I know exactly what you are trying to do.

17
00:00:40,757 --> 00:00:42,806
As soon as I can, I'm coming for you.

18
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:44,935
And Gabe was kicked out of the tribe.

19
00:00:44,936 --> 00:00:46,733
Gabe, the tribe has spoken.

20
00:00:48,355 --> 00:00:51,625
11 remain.
Who will be eliminated tonight?

23
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:15,101
The original 4 Rotu, Zoe, myself, John and Tammy,
made a pact to try to control this

24
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:17,402
and take us to the bottom 4.

25
00:02:17,832 --> 00:02:22,540
And right now, we're pretty confident we're in control.

26
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:27,182
I'm not talking bullshit.

27
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,021
I mean, if we get it right,
the winner will come out of this group.

28
00:02:30,062 --> 00:02:34,197
I've been waiting to lose one
so we could, you know, get rid of Gabe....

29
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,898
My leadership has emerged since we kicked Gabe out.

30
00:02:38,935 --> 00:02:43,571
It was a big change,
especially because now everyone knows that I am the leader.

31
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:45,190
Everyone knows that I pull the strings.

32
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:47,131
If we were to lose the next immunity challenge,

33
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,402
we would be 4 against 3.

34
00:02:48,437 --> 00:02:51,156
And, to be honest, the reward challenge is what we really want.
is the one we really want.

35
00:02:51,232 --> 00:02:55,181
No matter what it is,
we need the best people to participate.

36
00:02:55,256 --> 00:03:01,471
And maybe not put so much effort and will
in the immunity that comes later.

37
00:03:06,074 --> 00:03:06,084
John has proclaimed himself to be the powerhouse of our little
our little group.

38
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,293
Fine by me.

39
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,290
Right now, it's my turn to sit back, relax,
and let him eat the brown stuff.

40
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:14,519
He will be the target of the anger.

41
00:03:19,818 --> 00:03:26,467
It will be my new tribal baptism, or whatever you want to call it,
but I got silly and went swimming in my balls.

42
00:03:26,546 --> 00:03:29,451
Hey, Rob, I'm going to jump naked.

43
00:03:31,838 --> 00:03:36,007
I was there with the original Rotu,
and after expelling Gabe,

44
00:03:36,042 --> 00:03:40,649
it was like getting all that shit out of the way
and start all over again.

45
00:03:43,478 --> 00:03:45,706
It was a very powerful moment.

46
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:50,413
Symbolically, it is like demonstrating another level in our relationship.
in our relationship.

47
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:53,425
I would not be comfortable doing it with the other 3.

48
00:04:03,164 --> 00:04:03,174
Now the only chance we have is to hope to win immunity tomorrow.
is to hope to win immunity tomorrow,

49
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:03,992
and that there be a merger.

50
00:04:04,064 --> 00:04:06,615
We have to work something out with the other side.

51
00:04:07,551 --> 00:04:09,132
If not, we're out of here.

52
00:04:09,893 --> 00:04:12,301
It's clear, they beat us 4-3.

53
00:04:12,332 --> 00:04:17,254
By losing Gabe, we have lost a big advantage.

54
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,777
We know there are 4, we know there are 3.

55
00:04:20,817 --> 00:04:22,971
We are going to be kicked out one by one.

56
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,798
And these little kisses...

57
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:25,799
And V. is clear that...

58
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:33,082
I don't know what you are about, but you are clearly and visibly distancing yourself from us.
clearly and visibly.

59
00:04:33,452 --> 00:04:37,287
V. is driving me crazy,
because it's so clear what he's doing.

60
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:38,946
I do not trust V.

61
00:04:40,307 --> 00:04:41,924
I have never trusted V.

62
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:45,486
I'll tell you one thing, Sean, my main goal is to get rid of him.

63
00:04:46,381 --> 00:04:48,393
Because he thinks he's the dick.

64
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:51,664
If I get the slightest chance to kick John out,
I will take it.

65
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:53,235
I still don't have an angle.

66
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,977
I don't have a strategy yet,
but if I get the chance to kick him out,

67
00:04:58,016 --> 00:04:59,237
will be the first to leave.

68
00:04:59,273 --> 00:05:03,980
And if tomorrow we lose immunity,
yes, it will probably be you or me.

69
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:24,837
On this side there is more time to be quiet
because you don't have to work gathering food.

70
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:26,704
You have it at your fingertips.

71
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,147
Paschal, have you found anything?

72
00:05:29,198 --> 00:05:30,946
yes, I see one.

73
00:05:30,989 --> 00:05:32,775
Where there is one, there are more.

74
00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:36,800
Physically, we are no competition
for the other team, and we know it.

75
00:05:36,876 --> 00:05:38,957
But we take it as best we can.

76
00:05:38,995 --> 00:05:41,904
Let's see, we do what we can,
and there is no need to think about it any more.

77
00:05:41,957 --> 00:05:44,525
The mother of the lamb, look at this colleague!

78
00:05:44,563 --> 00:05:46,540
- Do you have that side?
- I have this side.

79
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:48,624
Good job.

80
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:54,367
I used to worry about being in this little group of women with an older gentleman.
with an older gentleman,

81
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,630
and that it was going to be difficult to win.

82
00:05:56,672 --> 00:06:01,014
But now that I'm here,
I see that it all comes down to spirit and energy and desire.

83
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,706
Oh, come here.

84
00:06:02,741 --> 00:06:04,396
Where are those tweezers?

85
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:05,942
Oh, no, not at all!

86
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:06,956
Not at all.

87
00:06:10,797 --> 00:06:13,456
You little bastard!

88
00:06:23,777 --> 00:06:25,249
The mother who bore you!

89
00:06:25,295 --> 00:06:27,895
He pinched me twice.

90
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:29,416
Fuck!

91
00:06:29,452 --> 00:06:30,419
Oh, look at that.

92
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,181
Oh, my God.

93
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,662
No wonder it hurts to be pinched.

94
00:06:34,735 --> 00:06:39,693
In Rotu we didn't eat as well
because there were more mouths to feed.

95
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,421
We are going to have to cook them right now.

96
00:06:41,462 --> 00:06:45,840
We didn't eat in the morning, we didn't eat at noon,
we only had dinner.

97
00:06:45,913 --> 00:06:47,497
That was great, Paschal.

98
00:06:48,394 --> 00:06:50,189
I just waited for them to come out of the hole.

99
00:06:50,236 --> 00:06:54,072
Yes, you have to wait for them to turn around.

100
00:06:54,107 --> 00:06:55,621
Yes, control the time.

101
00:06:56,732 --> 00:06:58,636
Well, we know where to come.

102
00:06:58,674 --> 00:06:59,666
Here.

103
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:00,866
Good one, Kathy.

104
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,507
Yes.

105
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,776
If we win this one, as we are eating,
and knowing what they're eating...

106
00:07:15,843 --> 00:07:17,813
Believe me, they are not eating.

107
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,474
I think they care more about food than immunity,

108
00:07:20,515 --> 00:07:22,414
because they probably already have their alliance.

109
00:07:22,486 --> 00:07:23,892
They already know who they are going to kick.

110
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:27,742
I can't wait to see which of the old guys got the boot.

111
00:07:27,807 --> 00:07:31,151
It's going to be a stick for us
if it hasn't been one of your old ones,

112
00:07:31,187 --> 00:07:34,418
because it seems to me that we all assume
that it's going to be one of two people.

113
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:35,901
I think it's going to be Rob,

114
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:37,370
others believe it will be Sean.

115
00:07:37,405 --> 00:07:39,454
It will be interesting to find out who.

116
00:07:41,107 --> 00:07:42,046
Guys, this is it.

117
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:47,754
Food on this side is much easier to find than in Rotu.
than in Rotu.

118
00:07:47,795 --> 00:07:51,304
It's just amazing,
it's like night and day.

119
00:07:51,372 --> 00:07:52,533
And it is very fresh.

120
00:07:52,616 --> 00:07:56,036
We don't need food like they do,
that's for sure.

121
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,467
Let's see what we have today.

122
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:09,878
Sushi?

123
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,386
Oh, it's going to be food!

124
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,573
Yes, it is true.

125
00:08:12,611 --> 00:08:18,291
"It's time to visit a mystical place.
The ideal place for your new career.

126
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:25,768
"Beyond land and sea, traveling a little further,
the first tribe sits down to dinner!

127
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:27,351
Yes!

128
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:30,655
They're not going to beat us by a long shot.

129
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,555
Not at all.

130
00:08:31,596 --> 00:08:34,897
No way, and if there is food at the finish line,
that's motivation enough.

131
00:08:34,934 --> 00:08:36,122
Rock and roll, people.

132
00:08:52,812 --> 00:08:54,393
Gabe has been fired.

133
00:08:54,428 --> 00:08:55,579
Oh!

134
00:09:03,882 --> 00:09:05,342
Here in front, Rob.

135
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,532
Okay, let's go to our reward challenge.

136
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:15,615
It's a relay race through the jungle.

137
00:09:15,653 --> 00:09:16,368
It goes like this.

138
00:09:16,407 --> 00:09:18,275
Four members of each tribe will compete.

139
00:09:18,348 --> 00:09:20,431
Relays have 3 parts.

140
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,829
In the first part, 1 of each tribe will run through the jungle until they find a paddle.
through the jungle to find a paddle.

141
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,010
It is tied with knots.

142
00:09:27,082 --> 00:09:31,010
You will untie it and move on,
giving the baton to another of the tribe along the way.

143
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:32,771
You must go together.

144
00:09:32,843 --> 00:09:35,969
The two of you will find another paddle that is tied up.

145
00:09:36,007 --> 00:09:39,405
You will take the two oars to the second part,
which is a pile of coconuts.

146
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,047
There is a key hidden inside.

147
00:09:41,099 --> 00:09:43,670
Start cracking coconuts until you find it.

148
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:47,408
Then pass the key and the oars to the other two tribe members.
two other tribe members.

149
00:09:47,443 --> 00:09:52,943
In the third and last part,
these two members will use the key to open the canoe.

150
00:09:52,979 --> 00:09:58,183
You will paddle away, take the flag,
turn around, paddle until you leave the canoe on the beach.

151
00:09:58,254 --> 00:10:01,307
The canoe must be within reach of the chain.

152
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:06,878
The first tribe to have both paddlers on the tiki
in the tiki and places their flag wins the reward.

153
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,208
Do you want to know why you play?

154
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,141
Yes.

155
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:12,666
For starters, on a hot and humid day like today,

156
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:14,712
something cold, some Sierra Mist.

157
00:10:17,086 --> 00:10:18,705
Oh, it's so cold, look.

158
00:10:21,616 --> 00:10:23,736
A small sample of what awaits you.

159
00:10:23,806 --> 00:10:26,004
Oh, my God.

160
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:32,688
Chicken, quiche, bean salad and a very tasty dessert.

161
00:10:34,588 --> 00:10:35,054
Okay.

162
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:38,107
Rotu, since you have 7 members,
you have to seat 3.

163
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:39,750
Which 4 participate?

164
00:10:40,684 --> 00:10:44,171
Okay, V., Sean, Tammy, you sit down.

165
00:10:44,207 --> 00:10:46,147
The first two, head for the exit.

166
00:10:46,184 --> 00:10:47,045
Wait for my signal.

167
00:10:48,194 --> 00:10:48,878
Here we go, guys.

168
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:50,278
Survivors ready!

169
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:51,652
Go!

170
00:11:11,931 --> 00:11:13,135
Take it easy, Rob!

171
00:11:16,156 --> 00:11:17,808
Come on, Paschal!

172
00:11:18,374 --> 00:11:19,666
Come on, sweetheart!

173
00:11:19,703 --> 00:11:21,179
Well done, Paps!

174
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:32,418
Take it easy, Rob!

175
00:11:43,656 --> 00:11:44,735
Good, Paps!

176
00:11:45,485 --> 00:11:46,922
Come on, Paps, you got it!

177
00:11:53,073 --> 00:11:54,760
- You want me to carry the paddle?
- I got it, I got it.

178
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,926
I see, here they have changed the knot.

179
00:11:58,013 --> 00:11:59,255
They change in the middle.

180
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:10,013
Okay, Paps, are you ready?

181
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,746
This piece needs to be undone.

182
00:12:22,293 --> 00:12:23,589
Come on, Paschal!

183
00:12:23,736 --> 00:12:24,883
Come on, Rob.

184
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:26,392
Come on, you can do it!

185
00:12:26,465 --> 00:12:27,617
Let's go.

186
00:12:27,651 --> 00:12:28,729
Take your time.

187
00:12:28,778 --> 00:12:30,273
Take your time, take your time.

188
00:12:30,937 --> 00:12:32,196
Come on, Paschal!

189
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,832
The oar! The oar!

190
00:12:54,422 --> 00:12:56,362
Okay, 1, 2, 3...

191
00:13:00,784 --> 00:13:01,647
Let's go...

192
00:13:04,163 --> 00:13:06,284
Rob, wait, wait, wait, wait.

193
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,176
One on one side, one on the other!

194
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:14,536
On my side, on my side.

195
00:13:17,737 --> 00:13:18,816
Now rowing on the outside.

196
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:20,335
What are they doing?

197
00:13:30,151 --> 00:13:31,333
I go on the inside, you go on the outside.

198
00:13:33,023 --> 00:13:34,569
You still can, come on!

199
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,726
Come on, girls!

200
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:47,852
Drive, drive, you have to drive.

201
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:49,075
I row, you drive.

202
00:13:49,115 --> 00:13:50,115
Drives.

203
00:13:50,155 --> 00:13:51,877
Come on, girls, that's the way to do it!

204
00:13:53,605 --> 00:13:56,083
Drive, drive, drive.

205
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:56,948
Good job, girls!

206
00:13:57,989 --> 00:13:59,379
Rob, drive, don't paddle!

207
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,164
I am going to row.

208
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,886
Drives.

209
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:02,650
Put the oar in. There you go.

210
00:14:02,686 --> 00:14:04,408
Good job, come on girls!

211
00:14:05,006 --> 00:14:10,076
- Come on, come on, come on...
- Let's go!

212
00:14:19,742 --> 00:14:20,821
Come on, Rotu!

213
00:14:36,768 --> 00:14:39,608
Take it to the chain.
Take it to the chain!

214
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,868
Let's go, guys.

215
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:53,763
Push, push.

216
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,428
Run!

217
00:14:55,463 --> 00:14:57,573
Get the flag!
Get the flag!

218
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:09,066
Rotu!

219
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:17,289
- Rob wasn't there! Rob wasn't there.
- You're right.

220
00:15:17,363 --> 00:15:18,258
It is true.

221
00:15:18,304 --> 00:15:18,935
Rob was not there!

222
00:15:19,008 --> 00:15:21,090
Just a moment, I have to check something.

223
00:15:21,127 --> 00:15:22,635
Maraamu is protesting.

224
00:15:22,707 --> 00:15:25,978
To win, your canoe had to be
within reach of the chain,

225
00:15:26,016 --> 00:15:28,165
and the two rowers had to be in the tiki.

226
00:15:28,814 --> 00:15:32,783
The canoe has to be within reach of the chain,
Maraamu's is fine.

227
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,047
Rotu...

228
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,985
does not arrive.

229
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:40,977
Besides, El General was not at the tiki when you put up the
you put up the flag.

230
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,621
I spoke too soon, sorry.

231
00:15:42,664 --> 00:15:43,967
Rotu, you do not win.

232
00:15:43,995 --> 00:15:45,179
Maraamu wins.

233
00:15:45,222 --> 00:15:46,071
Feast.

234
00:16:09,793 --> 00:16:11,743
Oh my God, it's a picnic!

235
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:21,586
Oh, my God, look at all the drinks!

236
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:23,149
Oh, my God, there's ice!

237
00:16:23,186 --> 00:16:26,306
God, my hands are shaking.

238
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:30,442
Can I have another pair of Sierra Mists?

239
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:36,682
- What a mess.
- I can't believe it.

240
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,704
We can eat half each.

241
00:16:39,735 --> 00:16:41,570
Oh, my God, it's a baguette.

242
00:16:44,446 --> 00:16:44,457
Oh, jopé, guys, the chicken is amazing.

243
00:16:49,006 --> 00:16:52,909
It's delicious! What's in it?
It's like a kind of pickle or something...

244
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,106
The challenge was very exciting.

245
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,122
It was definitely the reward we needed.

246
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:03,793
Not necessarily the food,
but to keep Rotu away from it.

247
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:06,499
I must have eaten 20 cookies.
No kidding.

248
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:09,299
Me too. We have to eat slowly,
so we can eat longer.

249
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,489
That is very difficult.

250
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:13,183
God, I feel terrible.

251
00:17:13,229 --> 00:17:14,407
Why were they so grumpy?

252
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,521
Would we have been like this?

253
00:17:15,587 --> 00:17:18,644
I have to say that this morning I couldn't believe it.

254
00:17:18,715 --> 00:17:20,442
Oh, for Gabe? Flip-flopping.

255
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:22,777
- Absolutely amazing.
- Yes, I was flabbergasted.

256
00:17:22,815 --> 00:17:26,659
Actually, when we were there,
Gabe was probably the strongest on the team,

257
00:17:26,728 --> 00:17:28,139
I did everything.

258
00:17:28,185 --> 00:17:31,621
Well, there's bound to be a lot of fighting over there.

259
00:17:31,649 --> 00:17:37,476
I think the general opinion is that we feel like a family,
the four of us, I'm talking about a real family.

260
00:17:37,553 --> 00:17:39,132
It is heaven on earth.

261
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,650
An old man like me with 3 women?

262
00:17:41,724 --> 00:17:44,124
Does it get any better than that? No.

263
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:45,777
I love it when you say that.

264
00:17:48,114 --> 00:17:49,203
It's going to make me throw up.

265
00:17:49,266 --> 00:17:50,306
Yuck.

266
00:17:50,351 --> 00:17:51,924
I'd rather you vomit.

267
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:03,262
We spend three-quarters of our time
fantasizing about food.

268
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:08,292
That's why it was a great, great disappointment
when they said we didn't win.

269
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:11,670
I'm sure their bellies will end up hurting
with so much food.

270
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:14,156
I hope that they will be able to eat as soon as they eat.

271
00:18:14,225 --> 00:18:16,596
I won the race, I pissed on everyone.

272
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:17,718
I did my part.

273
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:25,219
I gave the key to Two Very Silly Fools,
and they proceeded to fuck up the rest of the race.

274
00:18:27,626 --> 00:18:30,467
Maraamu is out there eating all kinds of yummy things.

275
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,765
And here we are, eating roots.

276
00:18:34,744 --> 00:18:37,149
I don't mind so much that I lost the challenge.

277
00:18:38,445 --> 00:18:39,702
For me, it's just a meal.

278
00:18:39,778 --> 00:18:41,798
And I avoided asking for forgiveness,

279
00:18:42,973 --> 00:18:47,360
because I'm in a leadership position,
and I'm not going to apologize for losing.

280
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:50,054
These people are going to go down in flames.

281
00:18:50,103 --> 00:18:52,894
Those four are going to be sicker than a dog.

282
00:18:52,936 --> 00:18:54,727
The food looked great.

283
00:18:54,763 --> 00:18:57,890
But cucumbers, green peppers, and beans....

284
00:19:00,729 --> 00:19:02,382
foods that give lots and lots of gas.

285
00:19:02,427 --> 00:19:04,431
A lot of them. We would swell up in a second.

286
00:19:05,221 --> 00:19:06,623
I would not have touched many of the things that were there.

287
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:11,297
2 hours of yum-yum would not make up for it,
you know, 3 days of... going for the heck of it.

288
00:19:11,334 --> 00:19:13,382
That little meal means nothing.

289
00:19:13,461 --> 00:19:15,035
There are 26 days left.

290
00:19:15,073 --> 00:19:18,233
We didn't come here to eat fried chicken and quiche.

291
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:19,027
That's where you hit it.

292
00:19:19,061 --> 00:19:22,763
We came here to play and to win,
and that is what we are going to do, period.

293
00:19:23,482 --> 00:19:25,478
These are Tony Robbins' people, man.

294
00:19:25,534 --> 00:19:27,688
Let's give it a go.

295
00:19:29,346 --> 00:19:31,035
We have taro, we have coconuts.

296
00:19:31,077 --> 00:19:33,872
It's an everyday thing, though,
we deceive ourselves

297
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:36,062
thinking that John is going to cook something new.

298
00:19:37,428 --> 00:19:39,669
See what happens when you use your imagination?

299
00:19:39,698 --> 00:19:43,540
What I do is cook the fish first,
then I pour the juice.

300
00:19:43,614 --> 00:19:50,587
I kept some white pieces,
and I add the coconut, then the taro.

301
00:19:50,658 --> 00:19:53,100
It's not too bad.

302
00:19:53,176 --> 00:19:56,013
It's not fried chicken, but it's not bad.

303
00:19:56,088 --> 00:19:56,804
A great recipe.

304
00:19:56,877 --> 00:19:57,883
You have deceived me.

305
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:02,015
I still say the chicken would have been the bomb.

306
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,432
But here's the thing:

307
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:11,038
he says you would shit your pants.

308
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,786
What do we have here, apart from nature and occasions?

309
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,639
In the jungle, insects crawling,
in the hut of love, 8 friends sleeping,

310
00:20:28,675 --> 00:20:33,207
We have fire, food and shelter,
water from the tropical storm,

311
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,525
And for the pigs, a vertical trap is prepared."

312
00:20:36,598 --> 00:20:38,466
I don't recite as well as he does.

313
00:20:39,796 --> 00:20:45,552
Gabe had written a poem to Paschal when they were in Rotu, the first 10 days.
when they were in Rotu, the first 10 days.

314
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,316
And Paschal and Gabe had a father-son relationship.

315
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,050
Paschal has no sons,

316
00:20:50,113 --> 00:20:56,009
and he kept saying that, if he had a son, he'd love for him to be just like Gabe,
he'd love for it to be just like Gabe.

317
00:20:56,116 --> 00:20:57,590
Can you return it to Paschal?

318
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,667
Thank you.

319
00:20:59,431 --> 00:21:00,682
It is very special.

320
00:21:02,118 --> 00:21:06,253
This morning, when I saw Rotu for the first time,
I was stunned.

321
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:12,999
And to tell you the truth, I was very disappointed,
because I know what it was like to be there and what Gabe had to offer.

322
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:17,520
23 years old. What a kid.

323
00:21:19,318 --> 00:21:23,557
I still love the people there,
but it's different now.

324
00:21:23,595 --> 00:21:26,828
Now we are who we are,
and that is in the past.

325
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:33,944
Oh... it makes me mad.
He shouldn't have left.

326
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:34,952
He was very talented.

327
00:21:34,995 --> 00:21:37,436
Yes, he should not have been fired.

328
00:21:46,995 --> 00:21:50,556
I knew it would break his heart,
when we saw that he didn't make it.

329
00:22:09,434 --> 00:22:13,318
The mood of our tribe is very relaxed,
it's very peaceful.

330
00:22:13,354 --> 00:22:16,995
And we're at a point where we can
just hang out.

331
00:22:17,055 --> 00:22:18,275
Is it all in the breath?

332
00:22:18,355 --> 00:22:22,014
Yes, it's breathing,
to get rid of stress.

333
00:22:22,088 --> 00:22:23,920
And how long does this...?

334
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:24,818
Chi Kung.

335
00:22:24,857 --> 00:22:25,610
Chi Kung?

336
00:22:25,646 --> 00:22:27,155
Five minutes.

337
00:22:27,193 --> 00:22:28,340
Kathy is great.

338
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:29,779
Kathy has a very good spirit.

339
00:22:29,864 --> 00:22:35,179
It's a lot of go get 'em,
and probably more adventurous than me

340
00:22:39,468 --> 00:22:40,542
What does that do to you?

341
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,727
It gets you in shape.

342
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:42,626
Oh, okay.

343
00:22:44,244 --> 00:22:47,334
And now you can lie down on the couch,
turn on the soccer.

344
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:49,670
Open a beer.

345
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,245
Gina fits in, that's for sure.

346
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,645
Or well, we fit in with Gina.

347
00:22:53,723 --> 00:22:57,790
I think he was going in with reservations at first,
but he's coming out of his shell,

348
00:22:57,864 --> 00:22:59,520
that is very positive.

349
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,501
But it seems to me that there is an undercurrent
of politics in our tribe.

350
00:23:02,577 --> 00:23:05,430
Have you ever felt someone else
just by putting your hands in front of them?

351
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:10,000
- Paschal is looking at us like...
- Wait, wait, you have to go slowly.

352
00:23:10,038 --> 00:23:11,657
Now, tell me when you feel hot.

353
00:23:12,481 --> 00:23:14,064
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

354
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,358
Can't you feel the heat?

355
00:23:15,431 --> 00:23:17,371
Paschal, you are desensitized.

356
00:23:17,415 --> 00:23:19,348
You are old and desensitized.

357
00:23:19,393 --> 00:23:20,211
That's right.

358
00:23:20,257 --> 00:23:25,262
I am very concerned about the Paschal-Neleh union,
and that Gina will steal my job.

359
00:23:29,813 --> 00:23:31,252
- Neleh.
- Yes.

360
00:23:31,325 --> 00:23:34,165
Close your eyes. Close them.

361
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:37,255
Don't open them. I want you to smell.

362
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:40,627
Tell me what you smell. What do you smell?

363
00:23:40,668 --> 00:23:43,394
Wait. It's very sweet.

364
00:23:44,906 --> 00:23:45,444
Candy?

365
00:23:47,851 --> 00:23:50,331
It is soft. Let's cut it.

366
00:23:51,237 --> 00:23:56,803
For me, Gina is part of the tribe, there is no more Rotu,
we are a united tribe,

367
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,069
and that's how I'm going to finish this game.

368
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,986
- Oh, man.
- I can smell it from here.

369
00:24:02,055 --> 00:24:03,524
The virgin.

370
00:24:03,578 --> 00:24:08,342
I love Gina to death, and now I feel closer to her than to the others in the tribe.
than the others in the tribe.

371
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,403
As soon as Gabe was kicked out,
I knew there was an alliance with those 4 from Rotu.

372
00:24:25,413 --> 00:24:29,860
I would have liked to see them lie to my face,
when I asked them if there was or not.

373
00:24:32,025 --> 00:24:33,501
Can I ask you a question?

374
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:39,432
You, The General, Tammy and John,
don't you four have an alliance?

375
00:24:39,476 --> 00:24:41,804
We have a friendship, not an alliance.

376
00:24:43,033 --> 00:24:43,997
Interesting.

377
00:24:44,034 --> 00:24:46,406
I knew he was lying as soon as he told me.

378
00:24:47,844 --> 00:24:48,885
I just knew it.

379
00:24:54,956 --> 00:24:54,967
Don't sit there telling me that you're 100% sincere
and that everything is 100% legitimate,

380
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,044
and then you turn around to lie to me
and stab me in the back.

381
00:24:58,126 --> 00:25:00,958
Because, whether I play or not, I don't forget.

382
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:02,934
You know what I mean?

383
00:25:04,014 --> 00:25:04,946
I understand what you are saying.

384
00:25:04,983 --> 00:25:06,601
I don't trust Zoe.

385
00:25:06,674 --> 00:25:09,919
At this point,
I trust no one but myself.

386
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:13,587
I mean, if we win tomorrow,
there's still game for us.

387
00:25:13,624 --> 00:25:14,630
What's up, man?

388
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:22,754
The truth is that I was fed up with the emptiness
of the emptiness that John and the other 4 Rotu were giving us,

389
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:24,621
and wanted to get it all out in the open.

390
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:27,601
Are you telling me to my face that the four of you don't have an alliance?

391
00:25:27,638 --> 00:25:31,168
- The 4 of you?
- No, how can you say we don't have it?

392
00:25:31,241 --> 00:25:33,397
You'd have to be blind not to see it.

393
00:25:33,436 --> 00:25:37,940
Zoe told me to my face,
not five minutes ago, John.

394
00:25:38,015 --> 00:25:39,880
Maybe she doesn't think so.

395
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:40,779
John.

396
00:25:40,852 --> 00:25:42,344
Hey, have I lied to you before?

397
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:44,251
Do I have "stupid" written on my forehead?

398
00:25:48,178 --> 00:25:48,192
- For me, in my mind, yes.
- Of course there is an alliance.

399
00:25:48,938 --> 00:25:51,233
Okay, that's what I'm saying,
now you're being honest.

400
00:25:51,277 --> 00:25:52,884
I appreciate your sincerity.

401
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:59,789
But if we're going to talk about that,
we also have to talk about when we were going to kick Gabe out.

402
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:04,889
Your behavior towards me changed completely
and you were trying to find a scenario to throw me out.

403
00:26:04,925 --> 00:26:07,296
Not to you in particular, but to someone from....

404
00:26:07,371 --> 00:26:09,274
Look me in the eye and tell me it wasn't me.

405
00:26:09,353 --> 00:26:11,315
- It wasn't you.
- Uh, uh, yeah, right.

406
00:26:11,365 --> 00:26:13,905
Do I have "stupid" written on my forehead?

407
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,787
But you are our team.
You are here.

408
00:26:17,823 --> 00:26:19,367
We have numerical superiority.

409
00:26:20,337 --> 00:26:25,153
If there is a traditional merger, in the end,
3 of them and 7 of us,

410
00:26:25,192 --> 00:26:26,701
they 3 will go first.

411
00:26:26,738 --> 00:26:28,858
It is my unmovable word.

412
00:26:28,895 --> 00:26:31,770
The only thing that scares me is that I don't trust you.

413
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:33,378
I don't trust you.

414
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:38,050
I promise I won't try to win over the other side,
or anything like that.

415
00:26:38,124 --> 00:26:40,033
I promise to tell you everything straight.

416
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,690
I give you my word 100%,
we will not try to get the old Rotu to kick you out.

417
00:26:45,767 --> 00:26:47,493
It's not going to happen, okay?

418
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:49,333
And don't try to fuck with me.

419
00:26:49,403 --> 00:26:51,229
Okay. I'll take your word for it.

420
00:26:51,306 --> 00:26:52,395
- Will do.
- Okay.

421
00:26:52,432 --> 00:26:53,617
Same to you, man.

422
00:26:53,688 --> 00:26:57,083
I think, to some extent, I may have convinced him that I am part of the team.
that I am part of the team.

423
00:26:58,207 --> 00:27:00,332
I want him to trust me, but he should not.

424
00:27:01,554 --> 00:27:02,453
Are you gay, man?

425
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:03,975
Hey, don't ask me that.

426
00:27:04,013 --> 00:27:04,870
Don't you want to say it?

427
00:27:04,906 --> 00:27:05,884
Yes, I am.

428
00:27:05,938 --> 00:27:08,760
It was very passive-aggressive,
kind of spitting out the comment,

429
00:27:08,849 --> 00:27:10,123
"Hey, are you gay?"

430
00:27:10,158 --> 00:27:13,145
But hey, look, I'm 36 years old.
I came out of the closet a long time ago,

431
00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:15,364
So I said, "Yeah, look, yeah."

432
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:16,883
I said, thank you for getting me out.

433
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:24,178
But this 36-year-old gay guy from Omaha is pulling the strings.
is the one pulling the strings.

434
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:36,966
The immunity challenge is critical for me.

435
00:27:37,058 --> 00:27:40,663
If we don't win that challenge,
I will probably leave tomorrow.

436
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:45,445
Sean, V. and Tammy have to play for immunity today.
in today's immunity,

437
00:27:45,522 --> 00:27:46,769
because they sat down yesterday.

438
00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:48,714
I will be the fourth member.

439
00:27:48,756 --> 00:27:51,336
I am not going to withdraw, I want to participate.

440
00:27:51,368 --> 00:27:55,722
If we lose, and it's my last challenge,
at least I want to know that I gave it my all.

441
00:28:05,556 --> 00:28:10,873
Tammy and the General and I have had a couple of conversations about who would leave next.
about who would be the next to go

442
00:28:10,949 --> 00:28:12,698
if we lose immunity.

443
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:16,255
I'm just saying, I mean,
I try to stay two steps ahead.

444
00:28:16,302 --> 00:28:18,488
Rob is desperate to do something.

445
00:28:18,576 --> 00:28:23,947
I think we would be much better off
if Rob didn't get to the merger, period.

446
00:28:23,981 --> 00:28:27,682
He's a bit dangerous,
and we have a chance to get rid of him.

447
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:38,069
My instinct is screaming at me that it would be better to lose the challenge,
and lose this voice, this dangerous person that Rob represents.

448
00:28:38,177 --> 00:28:40,600
But the point is, I'm not going to lose on purpose.

449
00:28:40,672 --> 00:28:43,062
- I can't go and not try.
- Just don't do anything extra, like....

450
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,950
help if they get left behind. I am serious.

451
00:28:45,112 --> 00:28:47,381
We are talking about a million dollars at stake.

452
00:28:47,417 --> 00:28:52,411
What I was trying to say to Tammy
is that there are certain battles that have to be won,

453
00:28:52,483 --> 00:28:54,354
and certain battles that do not.

454
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:57,409
I hate the fact that I'm in this challenge
and you don't want to win it.

455
00:28:57,479 --> 00:29:00,219
I don't know what to tell you,
it's better for him to go.

456
00:29:00,252 --> 00:29:06,796
To be totally honest,
I don't know what I'm going to do when the time comes in the challenge.

457
00:29:06,797 --> 00:29:08,332
I just don't know.

458
00:29:16,197 --> 00:29:16,949
Go ahead, guys.

459
00:29:17,629 --> 00:29:18,354
Welcome.

460
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:19,685
First things first.

461
00:29:22,197 --> 00:29:23,842
Immunity is back in the air.

462
00:29:24,266 --> 00:29:27,039
Today's immunity challenge is a giant maze.

463
00:29:27,084 --> 00:29:31,851
Hidden in the maze,
there are 5 crossbeams that each tribe will use to make a ladder.

464
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:33,939
Each tribe will start next to the other.

465
00:29:33,977 --> 00:29:36,670
You will go in opposite directions to find the first crossbeam.

466
00:29:36,702 --> 00:29:41,772
The first tribe to collect the 5 crossbars
in order from 1 to 5,

467
00:29:41,802 --> 00:29:48,564
build the ladder from top to bottom,
and one person climbs up with the flag, wins immunity.

468
00:29:48,635 --> 00:29:51,764
To make it more interesting,
you will be tied up during the process.

469
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:53,594
At stake is the vote.

470
00:29:53,631 --> 00:29:57,516
Win today, guarantee yourself a one in 10 chance of being
of being the sole survivor.

471
00:29:57,605 --> 00:30:02,185
Lose, and your tribe will go to Tribal Council,
where another person will be eliminated.

472
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:05,283
Rotu, as you have 3 extra, you seat 3.

473
00:30:05,317 --> 00:30:06,327
Choose your 4.

474
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,325
Let's tie you up.

475
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:10,671
Kathy leads Maraamuu,
Rob leads Rotu.

476
00:30:10,714 --> 00:30:13,043
John, General, Zoe, you are out.

477
00:30:18,811 --> 00:30:19,891
Survivors ready!

478
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:21,296
Go!

479
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,622
Left, left, left, left, left.

480
00:30:34,088 --> 00:30:34,839
More?

481
00:30:34,888 --> 00:30:36,359
Remember that.

482
00:30:36,422 --> 00:30:38,256
Ready, left.

483
00:30:38,292 --> 00:30:38,947
We go to the left.

484
00:30:39,775 --> 00:30:39,785
On the left.

485
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:41,537
Left, left, left.

486
00:30:43,444 --> 00:30:43,454
Okay, turn around.

487
00:30:44,054 --> 00:30:44,065
Okay.

488
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,462
Come on, we have to go faster.

489
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,223
Right, we go right.

490
00:30:48,293 --> 00:30:49,299
There is something there.

491
00:30:49,338 --> 00:30:50,276
Okay, what is this?

492
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,243
Yellow.

493
00:30:51,286 --> 00:30:52,245
Yellow, but what number?

494
00:30:52,321 --> 00:30:52,967
Two.

495
00:30:53,011 --> 00:30:53,686
Two.

496
00:30:53,721 --> 00:30:54,404
Two points.

497
00:30:59,057 --> 00:30:59,324
Yes!

498
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:00,392
Quickly, quickly.

499
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:01,360
Hurry up, guys.

500
00:31:03,448 --> 00:31:04,792
Come on, we have to go faster.

501
00:31:07,344 --> 00:31:08,496
Okay. Number 4.

502
00:31:08,548 --> 00:31:10,183
There are a lot of blues there.

503
00:31:10,257 --> 00:31:11,800
Inside, inside.

504
00:31:14,533 --> 00:31:16,150
Rotu gets a head start.

505
00:31:17,837 --> 00:31:19,166
I want to get to the other side, guys.

506
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,639
Okay, we are behind.

507
00:31:20,687 --> 00:31:22,366
I know, I just want to tell you what I do.

508
00:31:22,435 --> 00:31:23,804
There, go to the left.

509
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:24,639
Okay.

510
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,306
Okay, we need three.

511
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,633
Way to go, Rob, way to go!

512
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:40,007
Large circular labyrinth,

513
00:31:47,662 --> 00:31:49,313
Way to go, Rotu.
You're doing great.

514
00:31:49,351 --> 00:31:50,390
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

515
00:31:50,463 --> 00:31:51,396
Hurry, hurry.

516
00:31:53,699 --> 00:31:54,564
Okay, we have one.

517
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,077
Release me.

518
00:31:57,152 --> 00:31:58,014
The three is going to be there.

519
00:32:08,116 --> 00:32:09,448
Wait a minute, I have to get my bearings.

520
00:32:09,485 --> 00:32:12,464
To get back to the center,
I think we have to go around this way.

521
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,783
Rotu has 3.

522
00:32:30,058 --> 00:32:31,823
Maraamu, finally in the race.

523
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,768
Okay, guys, help me get back.

524
00:32:40,502 --> 00:32:41,027
Hurry up!

525
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:43,593
Okay.

526
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:44,454
Let's go, let's go.

527
00:32:44,528 --> 00:32:45,458
3 is this way.

528
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,357
Rotu has 3, Maraamu 2!

529
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:48,443
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

530
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,991
Left, right, left, right, left, right.

531
00:32:51,247 --> 00:32:52,251
Kathy, on the other side.

532
00:32:52,301 --> 00:32:52,972
What?

533
00:32:53,008 --> 00:32:54,081
Go back the other way, honey.

534
00:32:54,122 --> 00:32:55,236
That was 4, not 3.

535
00:32:56,929 --> 00:32:58,363
Why can't we go around this thing?

536
00:32:58,436 --> 00:33:01,629
Let's go. We have to get to the outer circle.

537
00:33:01,691 --> 00:33:03,503
We can't, is there no way out?

538
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,336
Go this way, go to the right.

539
00:33:05,385 --> 00:33:07,602
- This way, Kathy, this way.
- That's not it.

540
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:08,829
We've been there a hundred times.

541
00:33:14,695 --> 00:33:15,954
No, we have to go through there.

542
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:16,880
See, over there?

543
00:33:16,924 --> 00:33:17,936
You have to move, you have to move.

544
00:33:26,231 --> 00:33:28,135
Rotu has 4, Maraamu 2!

545
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,500
Come on, this is the last one.

546
00:33:35,666 --> 00:33:36,623
Let's go, let's go.

547
00:33:37,487 --> 00:33:38,614
Guys, we have to go faster.

548
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:40,881
Nothing.

549
00:33:41,715 --> 00:33:42,428
Step lightly, baby.

550
00:33:42,504 --> 00:33:43,216
Light step.

551
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:43,935
Let's go.

552
00:33:56,008 --> 00:33:57,304
Rotu wins!

553
00:34:06,762 --> 00:34:07,978
Guys, stop.

554
00:34:08,575 --> 00:34:11,205
- The first victory.
- Here we are!

555
00:34:14,847 --> 00:34:17,214
Maraamu, I am sorry to tell you that tomorrow is Tribal Council,

556
00:34:17,251 --> 00:34:19,442
one of the 4 will go home.

557
00:34:48,513 --> 00:34:49,520
- How was your day?
- Fine.

558
00:34:49,647 --> 00:34:51,029
I have taken troca and cowrie.

559
00:34:51,067 --> 00:34:52,109
Really?

560
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:53,227
A lot?

561
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,631
4 trocas and I think 5...

562
00:34:55,701 --> 00:34:56,562
Good job.

563
00:34:58,181 --> 00:35:01,667
When we got back there was no fire,
and I was feeling pretty bad.

564
00:35:01,706 --> 00:35:04,727
I did not do well as a leader in the labyrinth,

565
00:35:04,763 --> 00:35:07,424
and when I returned I drowned the fire.

566
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:13,031
You have to remove the sand.

567
00:35:13,066 --> 00:35:15,621
I fired it up this morning without taking out the sand.

568
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:19,501
Gina and I often argue about throwing sand on the fire.

569
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:22,197
I always put sand in Rotu,
and it worked great.

570
00:35:22,268 --> 00:35:24,172
Maybe the sand was different there.

571
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:26,253
We are low on firewood, so we only...

572
00:35:26,328 --> 00:35:30,064
I piled it up, made a bed of embers and covered it.

573
00:35:30,102 --> 00:35:33,369
The sand suffocates the game when it touches it.

574
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:36,102
What if we pile up a lot of burning embers?

575
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,575
These are not hot.

576
00:35:37,654 --> 00:35:39,840
Some were hot
when I dug them up.

577
00:35:39,911 --> 00:35:41,275
Well, not anymore.

578
00:35:41,313 --> 00:35:45,591
He said that in Rotu they threw sand into the fire
so that the embers would be hot,

579
00:35:45,629 --> 00:35:49,400
and I know that every time I go camping, we throw sand on the fire
we throw sand on the fire to put it out.

580
00:35:49,469 --> 00:35:53,245
As much as there was burning,
it was not enough.

581
00:35:57,844 --> 00:35:58,973
I don't think it's going to turn on.

582
00:36:03,501 --> 00:36:08,278
I was hoping that we would go to Tribal Council
and vote tonight and then have a conversation.

583
00:36:08,354 --> 00:36:13,276
But I went to talk to Gina about it,
and she didn't think we should talk about it.

584
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,623
So I'm not going to bring it up.

585
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,562
They do not like the subject.

586
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,984
No, they don't like it.

587
00:36:21,057 --> 00:36:24,650
I don't think they have enough nerve to talk about it.
to talk about it.

588
00:36:24,684 --> 00:36:26,363
I do not agree at all,

589
00:36:26,396 --> 00:36:31,573
I think we should embrace it, man,
get it out in the open and enjoy the rest of the day.

590
00:36:32,893 --> 00:36:35,740
- The fire is out.
- Is it out?

591
00:36:35,782 --> 00:36:36,782
No fire.

592
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,616
Nothing? Are you sure?

593
00:36:41,021 --> 00:36:44,729
We know you have to leave,
and it is a difficult decision.

594
00:36:44,764 --> 00:36:49,146
I don't think they're going to vote for me
just because I wasn't with them at the beginning.

595
00:36:50,116 --> 00:36:52,922
I may be wrong, but I don't feel that way.

596
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:55,145
I just don't like his idea of sand.

597
00:36:56,156 --> 00:36:57,703
This is how fires are put out.

598
00:36:57,739 --> 00:36:59,285
That's what I thought, too.

599
00:37:01,332 --> 00:37:04,990
If I do personal strategy,
I would have to vote for Kathy,

600
00:37:05,035 --> 00:37:09,928
because I know automatically that Neleh and Paschal
are not going to vote for each other.

601
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:12,802
Have you eaten them raw before?

602
00:37:15,172 --> 00:37:16,078
You need lemon.

603
00:37:16,113 --> 00:37:17,370
They are hard as rocks.

604
00:37:17,442 --> 00:37:18,951
I'm not going to start tonight.

605
00:37:20,428 --> 00:37:22,763
To tell you the truth, I haven't decided what I'm going to do.

606
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:24,516
I've been going back and forth all day.

607
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:30,059
I know for sure I'm not going to vote for Paschal,
but between Kathy and Gina, I find it very difficult.

608
00:37:30,094 --> 00:37:33,784
Look, if you think about it,
we went to sleep many nights without eating anything.

609
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:41,013
Tonight we go to Tribal Council
and everyone is going to stand up and vote,

610
00:37:41,078 --> 00:37:43,883
and it will be a secret until that very moment.

611
00:38:10,396 --> 00:38:11,691
All right, let's get down to business.

612
00:38:13,094 --> 00:38:13,103
A lot has happened.

613
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:15,897
This small tribe of 4,
the real anti-favorites,

614
00:38:15,935 --> 00:38:18,091
proved to be very strong.

615
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:20,748
Paschal, what kind of tribe is this?

616
00:38:20,822 --> 00:38:23,696
What things have changed since you were last here?

617
00:38:23,731 --> 00:38:29,516
If you would have told me when I left Rotu
that we were going to duplicate what we had there,

618
00:38:29,553 --> 00:38:30,738
I would have said no way.

619
00:38:30,789 --> 00:38:33,721
We have not only doubled it, we have gone even further.

620
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:34,548
Really.

621
00:38:34,591 --> 00:38:36,165
So let's talk about loyalties.

622
00:38:36,235 --> 00:38:40,332
- Kathy, where does your loyalty fall now?
- I think the spirit of Rotu

623
00:38:40,406 --> 00:38:43,379
still lurks on the other beach.

624
00:38:43,419 --> 00:38:47,675
But it has diminished, and we have formed something that is truly united.

625
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:51,362
I think the two tribes have dissipated,
and we are creating something new.

626
00:38:51,403 --> 00:38:55,131
If there was a merger tonight,
would the four of you still be together,

627
00:38:55,167 --> 00:39:01,707
or would that be a hey, Gina, we had a good time,
see if we can infiltrate Rotu's force of numbers?

628
00:39:01,781 --> 00:39:05,338
No, the 4 of us would continue together, as a block.

629
00:39:05,388 --> 00:39:06,991
Of course, all 4.

630
00:39:07,027 --> 00:39:07,888
Neleh.

631
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:08,752
Of course.

632
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:10,549
What do you think, Gina?

633
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,783
Are you still the black sheep,
or are you now really part of a tribe of 4?

634
00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:16,082
We are a tribe, of course.

635
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:17,376
I would even call it a family.

636
00:39:17,411 --> 00:39:19,531
Tonight we do not want to expel anyone.

637
00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:21,974
Kathy, let's talk about yesterday's immunity challenge.

638
00:39:22,048 --> 00:39:25,390
You were dragging these people along
as if they were schoolchildren who don't want to get up.

639
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:29,847
Did you ever think, wow,
I hope we're still a tribe,

640
00:39:29,881 --> 00:39:32,183
and I hope they don't intend to make me the scapegoat?

641
00:39:32,228 --> 00:39:35,562
I went with my head down because I felt I had failed the tribe in the challenge.

642
00:39:35,635 --> 00:39:43,978
But on the other hand, there is such a feeling of family among the 4 of us,
that I felt better when we came out of the labyrinth.

643
00:39:44,042 --> 00:39:45,982
and returned to camp.

644
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:49,432
So, if you are such a close-knit family,
how are you going to vote tonight?

645
00:39:49,474 --> 00:39:50,870
How do you make that decision?

646
00:39:50,911 --> 00:39:51,843
Neleh?

647
00:39:51,888 --> 00:39:54,680
Every ten minutes I come up with someone new.

648
00:39:54,752 --> 00:39:59,496
I don't even know how many times it has crossed my mind,
because I don't want anyone to leave.

649
00:39:59,578 --> 00:40:01,428
Have you already made a decision?

650
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:02,864
Honestly, no.

651
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:04,698
Okay.

652
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:05,426
It is time to vote.

653
00:40:05,427 --> 00:40:06,679
Paschal, you are the first.

654
00:40:56,713 --> 00:40:57,841
I am going to recount the votes.

655
00:41:13,209 --> 00:41:14,503
As soon as I read the votes, the decision is final.

656
00:41:14,576 --> 00:41:17,309
The person eliminated will have to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
the Tribal Council area immediately.

657
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,504
I read the votes.

658
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:26,111
Gina.

659
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:30,300
Kathy.

660
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,077
Gina.

661
00:41:36,146 --> 00:41:37,656
2 votes Gina, 1 vote Kathy.

662
00:41:42,717 --> 00:41:43,575
Decisive vote:

663
00:41:45,267 --> 00:41:45,914
Gina.

664
00:41:45,948 --> 00:41:47,172
You have to bring me the torch.

665
00:41:49,938 --> 00:41:50,695
I love you.

666
00:41:55,438 --> 00:41:57,026
Gina, the tribe has spoken.

667
00:42:03,091 --> 00:42:03,810
It's time for you to go.

668
00:42:13,002 --> 00:42:17,458
Well, you guys have insisted on using the word "family" tonight,
instead of tribe.

669
00:42:17,532 --> 00:42:20,332
Sometimes families have to make difficult decisions.

670
00:42:20,381 --> 00:42:21,986
I'm sure this has been one of the worst.

671
00:42:22,956 --> 00:42:25,118
You can go back to camp.
See you tomorrow.

672
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,852

In the next episode of Survivor:

674
00:42:43,277 --> 00:42:45,147
The two tribes merge.

675
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,312
I am very happy to see you.

676
00:42:46,372 --> 00:42:50,359
Father in heaven,
we are very grateful for the unions among us.

677
00:42:50,431 --> 00:42:50,935
Amen.

678
00:42:51,008 --> 00:42:53,163
But... can they all live happily under the same roof?

679
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,530
Tell the truth for once, right?

680
00:42:54,565 --> 00:42:55,535
Zoe is lying to me.

681
00:42:55,571 --> 00:42:56,435
They are all lying to me.

682
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,950
In this game no one knows who is telling the truth.

683
00:42:58,989 --> 00:43:00,154
Don't lie to my face.

684
00:43:00,189 --> 00:43:01,309
You asked for it, man.

685
00:43:06,178 --> 00:43:08,884
Miss Kathy, Paschal and Neleh, you guys are great.

686
00:43:08,915 --> 00:43:09,978
I love you all.

687
00:43:10,049 --> 00:43:11,634
I understand tonight's vote.

688
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:16,960
The remaining members of the tribe... I hope you play well,
with cleanliness, and with strength.

689
00:43:19,717 --> 00:43:22,378
and it has been a wonderful, wonderful few days.

690
00:43:22,413 --> 00:43:24,963
Nothing can ever replace this experience.
