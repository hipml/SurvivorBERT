when did you first
start watching <i>Survivor?</i>

148
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:14,969
I first started
watching <i>Survivor</i>

149
00:06:15,068 --> 00:06:16,371
probably
when I was about ten years old.

150
00:06:16,413 --> 00:06:18,003
My mom loved this show,
but she said

151
00:06:18,103 --> 00:06:19,143
she could never play it.

152
00:06:19,241 --> 00:06:21,241
So I said, "You know what?

153
00:06:21,344 --> 00:06:23,384
I'll apply
and I'll play for both of us."

154
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:24,832
And then I lost my leg, Jeff.

155
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:27,211
- And then, hey.
- You lost it after you applied?

156
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,930
Yeah, I lost my leg
when I was 19 years old,

157
00:06:30,034 --> 00:06:31,764
and losing my leg is
the best thing

158
00:06:31,862 --> 00:06:33,522
that's ever happened
to me, you know?

159
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,480
It made me realize
the importance in life.

160
00:06:35,586 --> 00:06:38,276
Having something
like this happen to you...

161
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:39,682
It just really made me think,
"You know what?

162
00:06:39,724 --> 00:06:41,104
This is... it's just a leg."

163
00:06:41,206 --> 00:06:43,716
And I don't want to look back
and regret my life.

164
00:06:43,827 --> 00:06:45,617
I want to look back
and be proud of it.

165
00:06:45,724 --> 00:06:50,174
And the beautiful game of <i>
Survivor</i> and how it has evolved

166
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:52,895
is the reason why
I even wanted to keep showing up

167
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,620
and keep applying and try
to get on the show, because

168
00:06:55,724 --> 00:06:58,664
it's almost accepted
and encouraged to be different.

169
00:06:58,758 --> 00:07:02,898
And I'm just grateful to be here
and to be able to prove myself

170
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,210
and show
that amputees are badasses.

171
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,280
You know, I got a few
leg jokes along the way,

172
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:11,099
- so I hope I can tell you guys.
- [laughter]

173
00:07:11,206 --> 00:07:13,136
All right, so I've heard a lot.

174
00:07:13,241 --> 00:07:16,861
Let me see if I can encapsulate
what we've just talked about.

175
00:07:16,965 --> 00:07:20,065
<i>Survivor</i> is a lot of things.

176
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:22,282
First and foremost, it's a game.

177
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:24,449
It's a great game,
and one of the things

178
00:07:24,551 --> 00:07:26,381
that makes it so great is,
anybody can play

179
00:07:26,482 --> 00:07:29,282
because there really
aren't many rules.

180
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:32,409
<i>You form a community
with a bunch of strangers</i>

181
00:07:32,517 --> 00:07:35,997
<i>where you decide
how that society will function.</i>

182
00:07:36,103 --> 00:07:37,682
<i>You decide
how the game will be played...</i>

183
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:41,214
<i>Slow, fast, safe, dangerous.</i>

184
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,100
<i>You are forced to rely
on each other</i>

185
00:07:44,206 --> 00:07:46,686
<i>to live in a jungle on an island</i>

186
00:07:46,793 --> 00:07:50,483
<i>while simultaneously voting
each other off the island</i>

187
00:07:50,586 --> 00:07:52,716
<i>in pursuit of a million dollars.</i>

188
00:07:52,827 --> 00:07:57,207
Pretty tremendous. But <i>
Survivor</i> is also an adventure.

189
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,900
All of you got up off the couch,

190
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,790
applied
because you want that adventure.

191
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:05,966
You want to leave that normal
life behind for a moment,

192
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,688
fly across the world
to be tested

193
00:08:07,793 --> 00:08:09,483
in ways you can't imagine.

194
00:08:09,586 --> 00:08:11,376
It's terrifying,

195
00:08:11,482 --> 00:08:12,692
and yet you're all smiling.

196
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:16,593
- [laughter]
- Because it's also exhilarating.

197
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:18,619
So if you can just let go

198
00:08:18,724 --> 00:08:23,594
of expectation and instead
give yourself permission

199
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:25,689
to play,
you can change your life.

200
00:08:25,793 --> 00:08:27,553
You can change
how you see yourself,

201
00:08:27,655 --> 00:08:29,715
you can change how you see
the world, you can change

202
00:08:29,827 --> 00:08:33,167
how others see you, because
being here takes courage.

203
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:35,095
I'm glad each of you are here.

204
00:08:35,206 --> 00:08:37,786
I hope <i>Survivor</i> gives you
what you seek,

205
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:39,826
and I also hope you'll stay open

206
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:43,001
to receiving
what <i>Survivor</i> thinks you need.

207
00:08:43,103 --> 00:08:44,383
Shall we get into it?

208
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,832
[all assenting]

209
00:08:46,931 --> 00:08:48,661
PROBST:
All right.

210
00:08:48,758 --> 00:08:51,688
Tribe names.
Wearing red, you are Vesi.

211
00:08:51,793 --> 00:08:53,483
- [whooping]
- Yeah.

212
00:08:53,586 --> 00:08:55,966
PROBST:
In the middle, in yellow... Baka.

213
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,658
- Baka!
- [screaming]

214
00:08:58,758 --> 00:09:02,548
And on the end, in blue... Coco.

215
00:09:02,655 --> 00:09:04,235
[whooping, cheering]

216
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:07,314
All right, I'm gonna give the
ten points to yellow. I think

217
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,026
- that was the most tribe spirit.
- [cheering]

218
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:11,898
All right, you ready to get
to your first reward challenge?

219
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,210
[all assenting]

220
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,030
- Wow.
- PROBST: Here we go.

221
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,277
Two players are going
to race down the beach,

222
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:23,239
<i>retrieve and bring back...
two heavy wooden crates.</i>

223
00:09:23,344 --> 00:09:25,764
<i>Then two other players are going
to run out into the water,</i>

224
00:09:25,862 --> 00:09:28,482
<i>haul a boat back
carrying more crates.</i>

225
00:09:28,586 --> 00:09:30,376
<i>Once you get
all the crates here,</i>

226
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:34,452
<i>the two remaining players will
use those crates to form a cube.</i>

227
00:09:36,103 --> 00:09:39,143
<i>Then one player will
hop up on top,</i>

228
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:42,141
<i>use a bamboo pole
to retrieve a flint.</i>

229
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:46,341
<i>First tribe to get their flint</i>

230
00:09:46,448 --> 00:09:47,968
earns their camp supplies.

231
00:09:48,068 --> 00:09:49,968
It's not much.

232
00:09:50,068 --> 00:09:53,688
A pot, a machete and the flint.

233
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,693
- [Gabler whistles]
- No food, no help.

234
00:09:56,793 --> 00:09:59,903
You're gonna earn it
every single day out here.

235
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,380
Two losing tribes...
You will have to go to your camp

236
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:05,692
and try again to earn it
in another way. Big setback.

237
00:10:05,793 --> 00:10:07,143
You're not building shelter.

238
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:08,682
You're just trying
to get your tribe supplies.

239
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:10,624
All right, I'm gonna give you
just a moment

240
00:10:10,724 --> 00:10:12,864
to figure out
who's going to do what.

241
00:10:12,965 --> 00:10:13,925
[laughs]

242
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:15,314
Okay. All right, guys, come in.

243
00:10:15,413 --> 00:10:16,992
- Get in here.
- All right, so who's running...?

244
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:19,034
[overlapping chatter]

245
00:10:19,137 --> 00:10:21,307
You want to run?
Me and you are running?

246
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,647
- [overlapping chatter]
- PROBST: All right, six.
Let's go.

247
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:26,549
Runners, come out here.
Here's our line right here.

248
00:10:26,655 --> 00:10:29,305
This is official. Behind this.

249

Baka!

250

[overlapping shouting]

253
00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:40,829
Here we go. First reward
challenge of <i>Survivor 43.</i>

254
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:41,861
Yes.

255
00:10:41,965 --> 00:10:43,785
Survivors ready?

256
00:10:43,896 --> 00:10:45,656
Go!

257
00:10:45,758 --> 00:10:48,618
- [overlapping shouting]
- You got to race
into the jungle.

258
00:10:48,724 --> 00:10:50,974
Get two heavy wooden crates.

259
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:53,408
- [whooping]
- Yeah, Vesi!

260
00:10:54,448 --> 00:10:56,338
PROBST:
Doesn't matter
how you get 'em back.

261
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,928
You can help each other,
you can take your own.

262
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,764
NOELLE:
You guys got this!

263

- Who will emerge first?

265
00:11:04,758 --> 00:11:09,618
Vesi, Baka or Coco?

266
00:11:16,103 --> 00:11:18,103
- GABLER: Wow.
- [indistinct shouting]

267
00:11:18,206 --> 00:11:21,476
That's Sami back for Baka.

268
00:11:21,586 --> 00:11:24,136
Right behind, here comes Ryan,
here comes Cody.

269
00:11:24,241 --> 00:11:27,071

270
00:11:27,172 --> 00:11:29,342

PROBST:
Geo struggling with his crate.

272
00:11:32,206 --> 00:11:34,786
- [whooping]
- Awesome! Good job, Sami!
- Yes! Yes!

273
00:11:34,896 --> 00:11:37,136
Got to get 'em both back.

274
00:11:37,241 --> 00:11:39,101
There's Owen with the second.
Takes a fall.

275
00:11:39,206 --> 00:11:41,926
Here comes Jesse.
These are heavy.

276
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:46,554
Ryan now heading back to help
Geo, who's moving very slowly.

277
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:47,716
GABLER:
You've got it, Owen!

278
00:11:47,758 --> 00:11:49,168
You're good.

279
00:11:50,206 --> 00:11:51,106
You're good.

280
00:11:52,896 --> 00:11:54,376

You're good! Let's go!

286
00:12:07,034 --> 00:12:09,624
You got to get both people
to the boat.

287
00:12:09,724 --> 00:12:13,484
You've got to unclip and then
pull your boat back to shore.

288
00:12:13,586 --> 00:12:16,546
We've got Baka
still in the lead.

289
00:12:16,655 --> 00:12:18,685
Elie and Gabler pushing hard.

290
00:12:18,793 --> 00:12:20,073

Here comes Vesi.

292

306
00:13:01,137 --> 00:13:04,897
PROBST: Got Nneka and Dwight

You've got Jeanine and Morriah

You're good, Coco.
Start working on that cube.

309
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:13,587
It's going
to be Lindsay and James.

310
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:18,099
You're using all of
these crates to solve the cube.

311
00:13:18,206 --> 00:13:22,136
You are playing for a pot,
a machete and a flint,

312
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:25,791
which doesn't sound like much,
but out here it is everything.

313
00:13:25,896 --> 00:13:27,544
- Oh, no, there, there!
- There! There! Put that one!

314
00:13:27,586 --> 00:13:29,996
No. Here to there.

315
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:31,903
James and Lindsay
now with some excitement.

316
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,268
They think
they might have something.

317
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,070
JAMES: Let's go, baby.
Let's go, baby!

318
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:37,932
[overlapping shouting]

319
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:39,484
James and Lindsay...
They've got it.

320
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:42,306
- Help her! Help her!
- Help her up! Help her up!

321
00:13:42,413 --> 00:13:43,785
KARLA:
All right, you guys, come on.

322
00:13:43,827 --> 00:13:45,268
- We got this, y'all.

323
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,199

- PROBST: Lindsay is up now.

324
00:13:47,241 --> 00:13:48,509
- Let's go, Lindsay.
- A little bit higher.
You got this.

325
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:49,751
Take your time. Take your time.

326
00:13:49,793 --> 00:13:51,143
You got time. You got time.

327
00:13:51,241 --> 00:13:52,406
PROBST:
It's Lindsay
with the bamboo pole

328
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:53,828
trying to retrieve the flint.

329
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:57,341
Vesi and Baka still working
to solve the cube.

330
00:13:57,448 --> 00:13:59,478
It would be an early victory
for the tribe

331
00:13:59,586 --> 00:14:01,786
that was in dead last

332
00:14:01,896 --> 00:14:03,586
with a big comeback

333
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:06,069
if Lindsay can
close it out here.

334
00:14:06,172 --> 00:14:07,382
Can she get that ring?

335
00:14:07,482 --> 00:14:09,412
RYAN:

00:27:53,517 --> 00:27:55,026
- And I thought about it...
- NOELLE: It looks awesome.

668
00:27:55,068 --> 00:27:56,785
I was like, "I'm gonna
try making one of those again."

669
00:27:56,827 --> 00:27:59,237
<i>NOELLE:
I'm extremely happy
that I'm on Vesi tribe.</i>

670
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,934
Doing that first challenge
and kind of having,

671
00:28:02,034 --> 00:28:04,384
<i>you know, that winning
atmosphere made it</i>

672
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:07,832
<i>definitely a lot easier for
people to be happy around camp.</i>

673
00:28:07,931 --> 00:28:09,591
My first <i>Survivor</i> meal.

674
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:11,139
- Oh.
- Yes!

675
00:28:11,241 --> 00:28:12,381
Ta-da!

676
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,544
<i>NOELLE:
I think, off the bat,</i>

677
00:28:13,586 --> 00:28:15,756
<i>I definitely mesh with Justine,</i>

678
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:18,102
just because, you know,
we are similar in age.

679
00:28:18,206 --> 00:28:20,966
This tree looks
very suspicious to me.

680
00:28:21,068 --> 00:28:22,338
Yeah.

681
00:28:22,448 --> 00:28:23,820
<i>She is definitely
a very smart girl,</i>

682
00:28:23,862 --> 00:28:25,312
<i>and she's very determined.</i>

683
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:27,553
- Damn.
- So having that relationship
off the bat,

684
00:28:27,655 --> 00:28:28,965
I really, really think

685
00:28:29,068 --> 00:28:30,998
that we're gonna do really well
working together.

686
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:34,486
CODY:
Yeah.

687
00:28:34,586 --> 00:28:35,586
How do you guys feel?

688
00:28:35,689 --> 00:28:36,999
The game is afoot.

689
00:28:37,103 --> 00:28:39,523
- The game?
- [laughter]
- Yeah?

690
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,889
<i>CODY:
One thing that I've learned</i>

691
00:28:40,931 --> 00:28:42,241
<i>from the last few seasons is,</i>

692
00:28:42,344 --> 00:28:44,244
<i>obviously,
the game is very quick, and</i>

693
00:28:44,344 --> 00:28:46,164
I don't have an alliance,
I haven't talked to anybody.

694
00:28:46,206 --> 00:28:48,546
<i>I got to do something. So,</i>

695
00:28:48,655 --> 00:28:50,165
I saw my crack, and I took it.

696
00:28:50,275 --> 00:28:51,751
- I connect with y'all.
- JESSE: Yeah? It's all good.

697
00:28:51,793 --> 00:28:53,033
I'll be straight with you.

698
00:28:53,137 --> 00:28:56,377
Feel good about you,
feel good about you.

699
00:28:56,482 --> 00:28:58,662
What do you think? Same? Yeah?

700
00:28:58,758 --> 00:29:00,688
- I'm good. [laughs]
- Let's do it.

701
00:29:00,793 --> 00:29:03,723
<i>NNEKA:
Right now I'm excited.</i>

702
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:05,199
I can very easily
build a relationship

703
00:29:05,241 --> 00:29:07,481
with the guys
who are like, hey, easygoing.

704
00:29:07,586 --> 00:29:08,896
<i>I work with guys a lot.</i>

705
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,320
<i>I understand that.
And I was like,</i>

706
00:29:10,413 --> 00:29:14,553
"All right, first alliance.
Check, check. You know?"

707
00:29:17,103 --> 00:29:18,003
CODY:
Yeah, me, too.

708
00:29:18,103 --> 00:29:19,553
I always fear any salesperson

709
00:29:19,655 --> 00:29:21,475
in this game.

710
00:29:21,586 --> 00:29:23,276
- Justine?
- Mm-hmm, because

711
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:25,859
<i>they're so good at, like,
the game, right?</i>

712
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:27,061
The dynamics of how it flows.

713
00:29:27,103 --> 00:29:29,453
- Yeah.
- And that, that fears me.

714
00:29:29,551 --> 00:29:33,101
When I found out that Justine is
a sales representative,

715
00:29:33,206 --> 00:29:35,166
I was stoked. Like,

716
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:38,135
<i>there is a stereotype with
salespeople... like, manipulative</i>

717
00:29:38,241 --> 00:29:40,621
<i>or, uh, BS-er. So,</i>

718
00:29:40,724 --> 00:29:43,104
I'm making sure everybody knows
that Justine is a sales rep.

719
00:29:45,793 --> 00:29:47,143
That's the salesperson.

720
00:29:47,241 --> 00:29:49,831
Like, that's-that's my fear.

721
00:29:49,931 --> 00:29:51,311
<i>CODY:
I've told my tribemates that</i>

722
00:29:51,413 --> 00:29:53,143
<i>I work
for an elevator company, but</i>

723
00:29:53,241 --> 00:29:55,095
I don't need them to know
that I'm a salesperson.

724
00:29:55,137 --> 00:29:56,997
- I mean, I'm glad
that we're talking.
- Yeah.

725
00:29:57,103 --> 00:29:58,693
And we can get something going.

726
00:29:58,793 --> 00:30:01,383
<i>CODY:
I do sales
for the elevator company.</i>

727
00:30:01,482 --> 00:30:03,662
<i>Been doing it for a long time,
and, um,</i>

728
00:30:03,758 --> 00:30:05,440
my motto coming
into this was not telling people

729
00:30:05,482 --> 00:30:07,440
I'm a salesperson.
You can be damn well, I'm going

730
00:30:07,482 --> 00:30:09,452
to be going after the person
that's a salesperson.

731
00:30:11,413 --> 00:30:12,453
CODY:
Yeah.

732
00:30:16,034 --> 00:30:17,904
- [laughter]
- [chuckles] Right?

733
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,760
<i>JESSE:
I really like Cody and Nneka,
but for me,</i>

734
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:23,792
<i>I think the game plan is to not
do too much at this point.</i>

735
00:30:23,896 --> 00:30:25,996
Like, day one,
I want to sort of sit back.

736
00:30:26,103 --> 00:30:28,833
I want to see, like, who is just
naturally sort of cliquing up.

737
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:30,901
I initially cliqued with Noelle,

738
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,970
and I think that's, like,
natural 'cause we...

739
00:30:33,068 --> 00:30:35,208
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- Are around the same age, and...

740
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,900
<i>But I think that, like,
I can definitely</i>

741
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,240
see myself trusting you.

742
00:30:39,344 --> 00:30:40,694
<i>JESSE:
At this point,</i>

743
00:30:40,793 --> 00:30:42,343
<i>I'm in a really good position.</i>

744
00:30:42,448 --> 00:30:45,098
<i>Nneka and Cody want
to work with me,</i>

745
00:30:45,206 --> 00:30:46,616
<i>but then on the other side</i>

746
00:30:46,724 --> 00:30:48,594
<i>the two girls
Justine and Noelle are tight,</i>

747
00:30:48,689 --> 00:30:49,929
and they want to pull me in.

748
00:30:50,034 --> 00:30:51,613
<i>Back home,
I don't have very many friends.</i>

749
00:30:51,655 --> 00:30:54,235
<i>Like, it's me, my wife,
and my kids, so, like,</i>

750
00:30:54,344 --> 00:30:57,384
I don't really get invited to
parties or anything like that.

751
00:30:57,482 --> 00:30:59,082
But out here
I got, like, two invitations

752
00:30:59,137 --> 00:31:00,857
to two separate parties, and now

753
00:31:00,965 --> 00:31:02,805
I have to figure out
which one I want to go to.

754
00:31:02,896 --> 00:31:05,206
[laughs]

755
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,647
<i>GABLER:
I'm going to take this out.</i>

756
00:31:06,689 --> 00:31:08,026
<i>- OWEN: Yes.
- GABLER: I'm gonna put it here.</i>

757
00:31:08,068 --> 00:31:09,682
<i>- We'll do a triangle here. Okay?
- OWEN: Cool.</i>

758
00:31:09,724 --> 00:31:11,044
<i>GABLER:
Sami, just watch yourself.</i>

759
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:12,343
I'm going to come over you.

760
00:31:12,448 --> 00:31:13,898
You're gonna go over my head. Okay.

761
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,760
You're going to put it up
on that "Y" branch.

762
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,760
Back a bit more.

763
00:31:17,862 --> 00:31:20,242
- There we go.
- Good job.

764
00:31:20,344 --> 00:31:22,004
<i>OWEN:
People are working hard.</i>

765
00:31:22,103 --> 00:31:25,003
<i>Elie, Morriah and Jeanine have
been weaving fronds all day.</i>

766
00:31:25,103 --> 00:31:27,143
Okay, now let's put it up.

767
00:31:27,241 --> 00:31:29,071
- Whoa.
- Okay.

768
00:31:29,172 --> 00:31:30,475
SAMI:
Hey, we're going
to figure it out, guys.

769
00:31:30,517 --> 00:31:31,992
- GABLER: We sure are.
- JEANINE: I'm worried.

770
00:31:32,034 --> 00:31:33,454
ELIE [laughing]:
Oh, no.

771
00:31:33,551 --> 00:31:34,791
<i>OWEN:
God willing, we will have</i>

772
00:31:34,896 --> 00:31:37,066
<i>a beautiful shelter,
but the minutiae</i>

773
00:31:37,172 --> 00:31:38,522
<i>we're putting into the shelter</i>

774
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,830
<i>is not how I would want
to expend my energy.</i>

775
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:43,091
- I'm getting real thirsty.
I might...
- I know, I know.

776
00:31:43,172 --> 00:31:45,233
That well water's looking
pretty good right around now.

777
00:31:45,275 --> 00:31:46,545
<i>This 26-day game</i>

778
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,785
is so much more rapid.

779
00:31:48,896 --> 00:31:50,826
<i>I need to sneak off
and start strategizing.</i>

780
00:31:53,241 --> 00:31:55,241
We'll keep an eye out
for each other.

781
00:31:57,413 --> 00:31:59,164
Hopefully, we can...
You know, the number one rule

782
00:31:59,206 --> 00:32:01,856
of Tribal Council is don't go.

783
00:32:01,965 --> 00:32:04,545
<i>OWEN:
"Hey, if I hear your name,
Gabler, I'll let you know."</i>

784
00:32:04,655 --> 00:32:06,615
<i>That's not a whole lot.
I mean, this is</i> Survivor.

785
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:09,724
That's not like
a blood pact or anything crazy.

786
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:11,095
I will definitely...
will let you know

787
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,447
if I hear your name coming up.

788
00:32:12,551 --> 00:32:13,820
Yes, I will for sure
let you know.

789
00:32:13,862 --> 00:32:15,552
That's so weird to say.

790
00:32:15,655 --> 00:32:17,199
- No, I mean, it's...
That's what we're doing.

791
00:32:17,241 --> 00:32:19,130
- Yeah.
- OWEN: Are you getting
good vibes from anybody?

792
00:32:19,172 --> 00:32:21,268
- JEANINE: Honestly, I'm getting
good vibes from everyone.
- Yeah.

793
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,140
No one seems to be scheming.
No one's, like,

794
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:25,241
trying to do too much.

795
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,820
<i>People have been very guarded.
No one wants</i>

796
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:29,722
<i>to jump out as being strategic,
and it's...</i>

797
00:32:29,827 --> 00:32:31,237
it's a little frustrating.

798
00:32:31,344 --> 00:32:32,785
<i>The way alliances are going
right now,</i>

799
00:32:32,827 --> 00:32:35,067
<i>it's like we're trying
to chop these coconuts.</i>

800
00:32:35,172 --> 00:32:36,482
<i>Just hacking away, hacking away.</i>

801
00:32:36,586 --> 00:32:37,656
<i>And just bang, bang, bang.</i>

802
00:32:37,758 --> 00:32:39,278
<i>Like, open up, open up.</i>

803
00:32:39,379 --> 00:32:40,999
And I think,
later on in the game,

804
00:32:41,103 --> 00:32:42,933
<i>it might bite us in the butt.</i>

805
00:32:43,034 --> 00:32:46,074
A little more coconut pressure's
gonna do it. [sighs]

806
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:50,412
MORRIAH:
So, my oldest sister is 42.

807
00:32:50,517 --> 00:32:52,967
I have a sister who's 35, 33,

808
00:32:53,068 --> 00:32:54,448
- 30, 28.
- Okay.

809
00:32:54,551 --> 00:32:56,661
My oldest half sister is, like,

810
00:32:56,758 --> 00:32:58,078
- 18 years older.
- MORRIAH: Okay.

811
00:32:58,137 --> 00:32:59,927
ELIE:
But I have one full sister,

812
00:33:00,034 --> 00:33:02,034
but she passed away.

813
00:33:02,137 --> 00:33:05,407
- Oh... I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

814
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:06,477
I'm so sorry.

815
00:33:06,586 --> 00:33:09,066
Yeah, but she...
she died in 2020.

816
00:33:09,172 --> 00:33:13,412
Definitely the worst thing
that ever happened in my life.

817
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:17,071
<i>When we were growing up,
my sister was my hero.</i>

818
00:33:17,172 --> 00:33:19,102
<i>She's smarter than me,
she's prettier than me.</i>

819
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:21,406
<i>She is everything to me.</i>

820
00:33:21,517 --> 00:33:24,407
And then there was this
major trauma that happened

821
00:33:24,517 --> 00:33:27,587
<i>to my entire family, and I think
that my sister dealt with it by</i>

822
00:33:27,689 --> 00:33:28,719
using drugs.

823
00:33:31,379 --> 00:33:33,759
<i>I tried to help guide her
through the struggles</i>

824
00:33:33,862 --> 00:33:37,212
<i>that she experienced, and our
relationship became strained.</i>

825
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:40,340
<i>And we hadn't spoken in a year.</i>

826
00:33:40,448 --> 00:33:43,098
<i>The last conversation
that we had was aboutSurvivor,</i>

827
00:33:43,206 --> 00:33:45,236
<i>and it was just like
I was talking</i>

828
00:33:45,344 --> 00:33:47,344
<i>to the sister that I knew.</i>

829
00:33:47,448 --> 00:33:50,068
Um, but she told me
that she was proud of me,

830
00:33:50,172 --> 00:33:52,242
and she told me

<i>GEO:
Me and Karla... we kind of,
like, started vibing.</i>

999

<i>We're both married, both gay,</i>

1000
00:40:20,896 --> 00:40:22,756
and we're both Latino.

1001

She's from Mexico,
I'm from Peru.

1002
00:40:24,586 --> 00:40:26,026
So we have a lot in common.

1003
00:40:28,344 --> 00:40:30,034
Mm-hmm.

1004
00:40:39,965 --> 00:40:40,995
Yes.

1005
00:40:56,137 --> 00:40:58,027
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.

1006
00:40:58,137 --> 00:40:59,687
I know.

1007
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:02,553
<i>I play with my heart,
and I feel like</i>

1008
00:41:02,655 --> 00:41:04,785
I want people to see the type
of person that I am,

1009
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:06,376
and I want people
to see my life.

1010
00:41:06,482 --> 00:41:10,142
<i>I think that's going
to be a good way to get people</i>

1011
00:41:10,241 --> 00:41:11,691
<i>to open up about themselves,</i>

1012
00:41:11,793 --> 00:41:13,313
so that way
we can feel more connected

1013
00:41:13,413 --> 00:41:14,863
and we can work together.

1014
00:41:15,965 --> 00:41:17,995
Thanks.

1015
00:41:22,034 --> 00:41:23,624
You know?

1016
00:41:26,068 --> 00:41:28,138
So...

1017
00:41:28,241 --> 00:41:29,971
<i>KARLA: Coming into this game,
I was just</i>

1018
00:41:30,068 --> 00:41:31,544
so nervous. Like, no one's
going to want to work with me.

1019
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:32,820
They're going to see me
and they're going to be like,

1020
00:41:32,862 --> 00:41:34,242
"Who the hell is this girl?"

1021
00:41:34,344 --> 00:41:36,454
<i>But now it feels like
I've spoken to everyone.</i>

1022
00:41:36,551 --> 00:41:38,661
[sighs]
So...

1023
00:41:41,827 --> 00:41:43,897
Okay.

1024
00:41:46,586 --> 00:41:48,616
Yeah.

1025

1028
00:41:59,379 --> 00:42:01,549
It feels like I'm in the middle.

1029
00:42:01,655 --> 00:42:03,335
Let's try not
to spend too much time, like,

1030
00:42:03,413 --> 00:42:05,213
all of us hanging out together

1031
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:07,380
- because
I don't want people to suspect.
- Yeah.

1032
00:42:07,482 --> 00:42:09,412
<i>KARLA:
Coming in, I was</i>

1033

00:42:12,517 --> 00:42:15,787
<i>that people would think that I
won't do well on our challenges.</i>

1035

<i>I honestly thought
I was going to go out first,</i>

1036
00:42:18,344 --> 00:42:21,484
<i>so it's hard to trust that

1037
00:42:21,586 --> 00:42:23,406
<i>and solidify my vote.</i>

1038
00:42:23,517 --> 00:42:25,337
<i>So I don't know what to believe.</i>

1039
00:42:25,448 --> 00:42:27,138
I don't think
this is good for people

to be, like... this scrambled.

1041
00:42:38,103 --> 00:42:41,313
I had a couple tattoos, man,
so this is just, uh...

1042
00:42:41,413 --> 00:42:43,343
I had one
on the back of my head removed.

1043
00:42:43,448 --> 00:42:45,308
- What?
- Had one on my face.

1044
00:42:45,413 --> 00:42:47,143
You had a tattoo on your face?

1045
00:42:47,241 --> 00:42:48,551
Yes, sir. [laughs]

1046
00:42:48,655 --> 00:42:50,545
CODY:
Where was the one on your face?

1047
00:42:50,655 --> 00:42:51,923
Like, was it, like,
a Mike Tyson tattoo?

1048
00:42:51,965 --> 00:42:53,685
No, it was, uh, three dots.

1049
00:42:53,793 --> 00:42:55,193
- I had three dots right here.
- Oh.

1050
00:42:55,275 --> 00:42:57,965
- JUSTINE: Tattoo?
- Yeah, right here.

1051
00:42:58,068 --> 00:43:00,098
When I was a teenager,
I was, I was in a gang,

1052
00:43:00,206 --> 00:43:02,066
- and so...
- Oh.

1053
00:43:02,172 --> 00:43:03,923
- Sort of juvenile hall
and stuff like that.
- JUSTINE: Yeah.

1054
00:43:03,965 --> 00:43:05,275
Ended up meeting some,

1055
00:43:05,379 --> 00:43:06,719
like, really cool nonprofits

1056
00:43:06,827 --> 00:43:08,302
- that were able to help me out.
- JUSTINE: Yeah.

1057
00:43:08,344 --> 00:43:10,554
They, uh, were able
to, like, pay for, like, things

1058
00:43:10,655 --> 00:43:13,215
- like getting the tattoo off
the back of my head.
- JUSTINE: Wow.

1059
00:43:13,275 --> 00:43:15,075
<i>JESSE:
Yeah, I'm not the type
to walk in a room</i>

1060

advertise my background.</i>

1061
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,340
<i>I grew up
in Los Angeles, California.</i>

1062
00:43:19,448 --> 00:43:20,998
My family didn't
have college degrees.

1063
00:43:21,103 --> 00:43:22,463
They had, like, addictions, right?

1064
00:43:22,551 --> 00:43:24,451
Nobody went to college.
They went to prison.

1065
00:43:24,551 --> 00:43:26,451
<i>You know, I ended up in a gang</i>

1066
00:43:26,551 --> 00:43:28,451
<i>and I ended up getting arrested</i>

1067
00:43:28,551 --> 00:43:31,171
<i>and going
to juvenile hall at 17.</i>

1068
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,235
<i>When I was in juvenile hall,
I was lucky enough</i>

1069
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:35,074
<i>to be in an educational program,</i>

1070
00:43:35,172 --> 00:43:37,382
<i>and they offered
a GED test there.</i>

1071
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:39,102
<i>And I took the GED test,</i>

1072
00:43:39,206 --> 00:43:41,716
<i>and I got one of the highest
scores that they had seen.</i>

1073
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:44,347
Like, that's when I think it was
sort of like a switch went off,

1074
00:43:44,448 --> 00:43:45,751
you know, and I was like,
"All right,

1075
00:43:45,793 --> 00:43:47,337
let me try
and, like, shift gears here."

1076
00:43:47,379 --> 00:43:49,299
<i>And so, that's when I started,
like, doing things</i>

1077
00:43:49,344 --> 00:43:51,454
<i>to better myself,
better my situation.</i>

1078
00:43:51,551 --> 00:43:54,621
<i>And I got accepted at Berkeley,
which was insane,</i>

1079
00:43:54,724 --> 00:43:56,174
<i>and then went on to Duke.</i>

1080
00:43:56,275 --> 00:43:57,915
<i>And now I have a PhD
in political science.</i>

1081
00:43:57,965 --> 00:44:01,235
<i>But coming out here,
I just want to show my family,</i>

1082
00:44:01,344 --> 00:44:03,406
<i>my son, my daughter that, like,
you can do anything you want.</i>

1083
00:44:03,448 --> 00:44:05,548
<i>But at the same time,
I feel like</i>

1084
00:44:05,655 --> 00:44:08,335

<i>for him to save himself.</i>

1810
01:14:17,689 --> 01:14:19,061
Gabler's not playing his Shot
in the Dark. We were just

1811
01:14:19,103 --> 01:14:20,509
- kind of chatting that.
- MORRIAH: I don't b...

1812
01:14:20,551 --> 01:14:21,992
- I don't know. I don't know.
- ELIE: We don't think so.

1813
01:14:22,034 --> 01:14:23,004
So, not Gabler.

1814
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:24,553
- Okay.
- What were you thinking?

1815
01:14:26,724 --> 01:14:28,284
JEANINE:
Oh.

1816
01:14:28,379 --> 01:14:29,519
So, Owen.

01:14:32,448 --> 01:14:34,658
<i>And I think he's a lot smarter

1820
01:14:34,758 --> 01:14:35,968

just how dangerous
Owen could be.

1825
01:14:44,206 --> 01:14:45,656
- That's true.
- ELIE: All right.

1826
01:14:45,758 --> 01:14:47,130
- So, Owen?
- That's the clearest way.

We're writing...

1836
01:15:06,275 --> 01:15:07,923
- I just wanted
to triple-fy check.
- ELIE: Yeah.

1837
01:15:07,965 --> 01:15:09,995
The three of us plus Sami
is going to write Owen.

1838
01:15:10,103 --> 01:15:11,523
Okay.

1839
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:12,958
MORRIAH:
The three of us
sticking together...

1840
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,240
- If we lose again...
- ELIE: Yeah.

1841
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:18,034
- we have three women
over two now.
- ELIE: Yeah.

1842
01:15:19,517 --> 01:15:21,337
It's like the smartest plan
for the three of us.

1843

1849
01:15:38,103 --> 01:15:40,143

really stressed right now.

1850
01:15:48,103 --> 01:15:50,453

of Tribal Council because,
as you know,

1883
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:50,690
in this game
fire represents your life.

1884
01:17:50,793 --> 01:17:53,663
And when your fire is gone,
Owen, what happens?

1885
01:17:53,758 --> 01:17:55,688
- So are you.
- Yeah.

1886
01:17:55,793 --> 01:17:56,793
Always breaks my heart.

1887
01:17:56,896 --> 01:17:58,206
All right,

1888
01:17:58,310 --> 01:18:01,790
so, Sami, let's talk
about the first few days.

1889
01:18:01,896 --> 01:18:04,276
What is life like back at camp?

1890
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:06,969
Life has been, like, a joy.

1891
01:18:07,068 --> 01:18:09,688
We were all harmonious.
It was all just like

1892
01:18:09,793 --> 01:18:11,693
a kumbaya group thing.

1893
01:18:11,793 --> 01:18:14,833
- We are final six, honestly.
- [laughter]

1894
01:18:14,931 --> 01:18:18,381
I'm stunned
by what Sami just said.

1895
01:18:18,482 --> 01:18:20,692
To come out into this game

1896
01:18:20,793 --> 01:18:22,723
and to actually believe
you're the final six,

1897
01:18:22,827 --> 01:18:25,027
"We don't need to think
about Tribal, we're going

1898
01:18:25,137 --> 01:18:27,167
to be fine," blows my mind.

1899
01:18:27,275 --> 01:18:31,275
Owen, did you share
that unbridled we-got-this based

1900
01:18:31,379 --> 01:18:33,719
- on absolutely nothing?
- Yeah. Well, like

1901
01:18:33,827 --> 01:18:35,187
Sami was saying,
like, we've gotten

1902
01:18:35,241 --> 01:18:36,751
to know each other,
shared our stories.

1903
01:18:36,793 --> 01:18:39,833
But in terms of the gameplay,
yeah, no one wanted

1904
01:18:39,931 --> 01:18:42,001
to put a target on themselves
by being that person

1905
01:18:42,103 --> 01:18:43,973
that is a little too antsy
to, like, rush in

1906
01:18:44,068 --> 01:18:46,998
and throw someone under the bus.

1907
01:18:47,103 --> 01:18:48,854
PROBST:
Gabler, the obvious downside is,
you wait

1908
01:18:48,896 --> 01:18:51,546
so late that people don't have
much time to make a case

1909
01:18:51,655 --> 01:18:54,165
to keep themselves
or even know it's them.

1910
01:18:54,275 --> 01:18:56,615
So it's just as vicious.

1911
01:18:56,724 --> 01:18:58,284
- Oh, yeah.
- Just in a different way.

1912
01:18:58,379 --> 01:19:00,309
But I think
that's all the more reason why

1913
01:19:00,413 --> 01:19:03,973
it was important to get
to know everybody early

1914
01:19:04,068 --> 01:19:06,518
because you never know how
the game is going to shake up.

1915
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:08,100
I mean, we were supposed
to win today.

1916
01:19:08,206 --> 01:19:11,546
- We really...
We-we gave our all.
- Supposed to win?

1917
01:19:11,655 --> 01:19:13,135
I just can't figure it out.

1918
01:19:13,241 --> 01:19:15,311
- I know.
- Based on what?

1919
01:19:15,413 --> 01:19:17,593
Well, I just want to say
that we did win today.

1920
01:19:17,689 --> 01:19:19,409
We didn't win
the immunity challenge 'cause,

1921
01:19:19,517 --> 01:19:20,854
- clearly, we're sitting in
this beautiful Tribal Council.
- Yeah.

1922
01:19:20,896 --> 01:19:22,336
Let me just take this in, Morriah.

1923
01:19:22,448 --> 01:19:24,928
- MORRIAH [laughs]: Wait.
- You won today because?

1924
01:19:25,034 --> 01:19:26,524
MORRIAH:
We won because

1925
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:28,061
none of us gave up
and we all tried our best.

1926
01:19:28,103 --> 01:19:29,440
- Yeah.
- And that's what it's about.

1927
01:19:29,482 --> 01:19:31,242
You're not always going
to win the game,

1928
01:19:31,344 --> 01:19:34,244
but when you walk away
knowing that you gave it

1929
01:19:34,344 --> 01:19:35,889
- every single last thing...
- Everything.

1930
01:19:35,931 --> 01:19:38,411
That you had in the tank,
then you won.

1931
01:19:38,517 --> 01:19:41,377
SAMI:
But at the same time,
moral victories

1932
01:19:41,482 --> 01:19:43,932
- mean nothing
at immunity challenges.
- GABLER: Right.

1933
01:19:44,034 --> 01:19:46,694
We're going to be here
every single time if we look

1934
01:19:46,793 --> 01:19:49,143
- at moral victories
as a real win in the books.
- Yeah.

1935
01:19:49,241 --> 01:19:50,591
- Mm-hmm.
- OWEN: I agree.

1936
01:19:50,689 --> 01:19:52,095
- That's right.
- Yeah.
- I have... I have enough

1937
01:19:52,137 --> 01:19:53,544
- moral victories
in my personal life...
- Yeah.

1938
01:19:53,586 --> 01:19:56,136
With the teams I root for,
so in <i>Survivor,</i>

1939
01:19:56,241 --> 01:19:57,551
it's not as attractive.

1940
01:19:57,655 --> 01:19:59,164
You want to... you want to win
at whatever cost.

1941
01:19:59,206 --> 01:20:00,164
We really wanted
to win this one.

1942
01:20:00,206 --> 01:20:01,326
Losing with dignity's great.

1943
01:20:01,379 --> 01:20:02,406
Like, we all had
our heads held high,

1944
01:20:02,448 --> 01:20:03,858
but it still sucks.

1945
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:07,235
So, if everybody feels good
about the effort today,

1946
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:09,554
does that mean
there was no finger-pointing?

1947
01:20:09,655 --> 01:20:12,475
Because Gabler and Sami... you
two picked the finishing spot...

1948
01:20:12,586 --> 01:20:14,306
- Yeah.
- And couldn't get it done.

1949
01:20:14,413 --> 01:20:15,973
Did anybody come back and say,

1950
01:20:16,068 --> 01:20:17,478
"Maybe we should look
at these two"?

1951
01:20:17,586 --> 01:20:19,682
GABLER: For sure, Jeff.
I mean, there is accountability.

1952
01:20:19,724 --> 01:20:21,624
You know, you feel bad
for letting people down.

1953
01:20:21,724 --> 01:20:22,992
You know, you want
to be the-the hero.

1954
01:20:23,034 --> 01:20:24,544
You want to...
you want to pull it out.

1955
01:20:24,586 --> 01:20:25,896
You know, but is it possible

1956
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,900
that I'd have a target on me
for that? Yes.

1957
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,900
ELIE:
But pinning everything on like,

1958
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,268
"Hey, you volunteered to do this

1959
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:32,550
"and you couldn't pull it out

1960
01:20:32,655 --> 01:20:34,095
at the end of the day," to me,

1961
01:20:34,206 --> 01:20:36,376
that's not a great strategy
right now.

1962
01:20:36,482 --> 01:20:39,452
So I think
that won't be what it rides on.

1963
01:20:39,551 --> 01:20:41,171
For me, it's almost

1964
01:20:41,275 --> 01:20:43,135
a first-come,
first-serve situation.

1965
01:20:43,241 --> 01:20:45,171
You know?
Who reached out to me first?

1966
01:20:45,275 --> 01:20:49,165
Who has been making an effort
to make some kind of connection?

1967
01:20:49,275 --> 01:20:50,925
Those things really do matter

1968
01:20:51,034 --> 01:20:53,484
because that lends itself
to trust.

1969
01:20:53,586 --> 01:20:55,986
- You know?
- Mm-hmm. It's like
that validation you need when,

1970
01:20:56,034 --> 01:20:57,509
you know, you just started
dating someone,

1971
01:20:57,551 --> 01:20:59,302
and you need that affirmation
from someone to...

1972
01:20:59,344 --> 01:21:01,284
- Yeah. Text me back.
- Yeah, exactly. Like,

1973
01:21:01,379 --> 01:21:02,854
give me a little bit
to go off of, and then...

1974
01:21:02,896 --> 01:21:04,647
and then you hitch onto that
and you realize,

1975
01:21:04,689 --> 01:21:07,859
"Okay, I'm being affirmed
that this is where I want to go,

1976
01:21:07,965 --> 01:21:09,135
and I'm not crazy."

1977
01:21:09,241 --> 01:21:11,001
And, you know, you...

1978
01:21:11,103 --> 01:21:13,623
- It's reciprocal from there on.
- Yeah.
- Morriah, did you feel

1979
01:21:13,724 --> 01:21:15,554
that people texted you back?

1980
01:21:15,655 --> 01:21:17,785

I'm not gonna...

1981
01:21:17,896 --> 01:21:19,616
I'm not going to go
into details, Jeff.

1982
01:21:19,724 --> 01:21:22,454
No, but I do feel
like some people text,

1983
01:21:22,551 --> 01:21:24,164
and I got a few phone calls
here and there,

1984
01:21:24,206 --> 01:21:26,406
and I'd like to think
that I sent out a few texts

1985
01:21:26,517 --> 01:21:27,757
and phone calls as well.

1986
01:21:27,862 --> 01:21:29,762
And it's scary

1987
01:21:29,862 --> 01:21:32,212
because we're kind of
out of this trance

1988
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:34,900
that we've been in,
and every single person today

1989
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,785
is going to pick up that pen
and write a name.

1990

- SAMI: I kind of feel
that same way. I feel like

1991

The game is on,

1992
01:21:41,517 --> 01:21:44,207

I mean, at the end

1993
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:47,830
of tonight, somebody is going
to be looking back like,

1994
01:21:47,931 --> 01:21:49,199
"What if I was
a little bit more aggressive?

1995
01:21:49,241 --> 01:21:51,551
Could I have made it
a little bit further?"

It's really interesting
how this conversation

1997
01:21:54,275 --> 01:21:56,785
started with all of you
entrenched in this idea

1998
01:21:56,896 --> 01:22:00,336
of a happy tribe, and now that
we are literally moments away

1999

I'm feeling the tension.

It's the price we pay for trying
to be kumbaya for too long.

2001
01:22:06,724 --> 01:22:08,414
And I think
whoever does go home is going

2002
01:22:08,517 --> 01:22:10,717

a few more texts out and
