>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:04,921
<i>Survivor:</i>
With Lex voted out, Kathy was

3
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:07,590
feeling the pain of being
betrayed by Rob.

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,467
>> I couldn't believe how
isolated I felt.

5
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:12,095
It's really hard being on the
losing side of life here.

6
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:15,056
>> PROBST: And the tribe faced
a monumental competition.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,226
Today's challenge is a<i> Survivor</i>
obstacle course, one of the

8
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:21,604
toughest we've ever had.
It is part reward and it is part

9
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,314
immunity.
>> Wow.

10
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:26,276
>> PROBST: Divided into two
teams, Rob's team dominated the

11
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,113
competition, winning ponchos and
letters from home and advancing

12
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,490
them to the immunity portion of
the challenge.

13
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,951
Go.
Once again, Rob sealed his

14
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:38,621
victory.
Boston Rob wins immunity and a

15
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,458
video of his brother.
But Rob surprised his tribe

16
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,252
mates with an interesting
proposition.

17
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,754
>> We had some bad blood
yesterday.

18
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:49,132
Is there any way, if I forego
seeing the video, everybody

19
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:52,969
could get their letters?
>> PROBST: I can make that

20
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:57,182
trade.
With Tribal Council looming,

21
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:00,602
Kathy and Shii Ann tried to stir
things up in an attempt to save

22
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:03,980
themselves.
>> You need to start reacting.

23
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:06,775
>> I think we've got some
last-minute scrambling going on

24
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:10,653
in Panama today.
>> PROBST: But for Kathy, all

25
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:14,157
the talk just wasn't enough.
She was voted out and became

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,328
the second member of the jury.
Seven are left.

27
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,623
Who will be voted out tonight?

(<i> thunder crashing</i> )
>> Well, last night was really

31
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:58,428
emotional.
Um, I got really choked up when

32
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:02,891
they voted Kathy out.
The smug, horrible Chaperan...

33
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:08,271
superior tribe pagonging all of
us Mogo Mogo members, you know,

34
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,149
basically voting one after
another out.

35
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,569
I knew Kathy was going, and I
just got really emotional

36
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,779
because she was my rock out
here.

37
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,783
And she was my one true friend.
And now that she's gone, I don't

38
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,287
have anyone here.
I've got no one.

39
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:30,793
(<i> thunder rolling</i> )
I know I'm slated next to go.

40
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,795
>> Mm-hmm.
>> And you know I have to play

41
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,381
the game as hard as I can
before I go.

42
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:40,428
So, I'm just asking you
straight-up, you know, are you

43
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:44,682
going to keep with your original
six, or are you going to be

44
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,309
willing to look at other
possibilities?

45
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,354
>> Yeah...
Like, honestly, I'm going to

46
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,981
stay with my plan.
>> That's cool.

47
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,983
You got to play your last card.
>> Win immunity.

48
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,777
>> I'm going to try
to win immunity. I will.

49
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,321
>> You've got to beat me,
though, 'cause I need it just as

50
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,657
much as you.
I know I do, you know?

51
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,992
>> I know you do.
I'm extremely vulnerable right

52
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,871
now, and chances of me making it
to the final two are slim.

53
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,166
So, at this point, my best
chance is to play as hard as I

54
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:13,670
can, call everyone on their game
and stir it up before I leave.

55
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,631
If you make it to the final two,
I'll be shocked.

56
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,509
>> I know.
>> With your strategy...

57
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,512
current strategy.
And I hope you do well, but, you

58
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:28,810
know, I'm wishing myself luck in
the next immunity challenge.

59
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:32,355
>> She tried to tell me
what my strategy should be.

60
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,190
>> Right.
>> "You need to watch out

61
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,651
for this person, you need to
watch out for this one."

62
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,361
>> Here we go.
>> She's doing that.

63
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,988
Just was patient and listened
to her.

64
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:44,158
I was like, "All right, thanks
for the info, Shii Ann."

65
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,452
We got to make sure she don't
win immunity.

66
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,663
>> Hell, yeah.
That's the whole goal.

67
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:53,543
>> That's it.
(<i> thunderclap</i> )

68
00:04:53,626 --> 00:05:02,385
(<i> twittering</i> )
>> Can it rain any more here?

69
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,221
Look, there's a bump on it.
>> Oh, yeah.

70
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:10,059
>> Wow, it's a mask.
>> It says, "A no-lose

71
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,187
situation, this one's not
a race.

72
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,732
Is everyone a winner?
Try not the lose face.

73
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,610
In touch with your own feelings?
What do your tribe mates think?

74
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,405
If you're the last one standing,
you'll decide what they eat

75
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,699
and drink."
>> Oh...

76
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,868
>> So maybe you get to choose
whether or not you want share...

77
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,703
>> So maybe you choose what
everybody eats?

78
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,747
>> I want...
>> I want everybody to eat

79
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,957
and drink.
>> The rain doesn't let up.

80
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,917
We can't fish in these
conditions.

81
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,253
We can't cook in these
conditions.

82
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,589
So, we are all hoping we're
playing for food.

83
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,051
>> "Try not to lose face" is
maybe three chops and your face

84
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,929
is smashed and you're out.
>> I'm hoping food or something,

85
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,807
but I'm really looking forward
to it because it's just a

86
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:54,353
miserable day.
Ooga, ga, ga, ooga, go, ga.

87
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,106
Hey-a, ho-a, ha.
>> Dumb ass.

>> PROBST: Rain ponchos coming

89
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:13,956
in handy.

>> PROBST: Seeing your likeness?
>> Yeah.

91
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,628
Amber and I are the same person,
just slightly different hair.

92
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,214
>> Look at me.
>> I have a very strange

93
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:25,802
expression on our faces.
(<i> men chuckling</i> )

94
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,304
>> PROBST: All right, let's get
to the first part of today's

95
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,681
reward challenge.
I'm gonna hand each of you a

96
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,934
questionnaire about your fellow
tribe mates.

97
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,978
The idea here is to find out
what you really think about each

98
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,439
other.
So, answer honestly.

99
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,691
Don't discuss your answers with
anybody.

100
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,152
Make sense?
All right, give you a couple

101
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,321
minutes to do this.
Find a little spot, step away

102
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:52,328
from each other.
All right, guys.

103
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:55,123
The results have been tallied.
I'm going to ask you the same

104
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:58,459
exact questions again, only this
time your answers should be

105
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:02,213
based on how you think the
majority of the tribe answered.

106
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:05,299
Every time your answer matches
what the tribe said, you get to

107
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,844
make one chop on a tribe
mate's row.

108
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:12,348
Three chops release a battering
ram and you're out of the game.

109
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:15,309
Last person left standing wins
reward.

110
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,813
The reward is food.
However, all of you will be

111
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,983
picked up by boat and taken to a
local Panamanian restaurant.

112
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,527
On the menu are seven items.
>> Wow.

113
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,530
>> PROBST: Each item increases
in value and taste, everything

114
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,867
from a bowl of rice and a glass
of water from your own camp to a

115
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,327
full-on steak dinner with all
the fixings.

116
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,037
>> Oh...
>> PROBST: The winner will be in

117
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,082
charge of that menu.
>> Oh, my God!

118
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:42,378
>> PROBST: Here's the rub: You
cannot share your meal.

119
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:45,214
Somebody will get a whole lot,
and somebody is gonna get

120
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,549
very little.
>> Okay.

121
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,051
>> PROBST: All right.
Let's get started.

122
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:54,056
First question: Who would you
trust with your life?

123
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:59,061
Everybody reveal.
The group thought Rob.

124
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,230
Alicia got it right.
Amber got it right.

125
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,940
Rob, you didn't even get it
right.

126
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:07,236
Alicia, you get the first chop.
>> Oh, Shii Ann, Shii Ann.

127
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,238
>> Surprise.
>> PROBST: Amber, you're up.

128
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,867
Who's getting the damage?
>> I'm going to go for Big Tom

129
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,454
since he stole my pot in that
one challenge.

130
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,539
>> PROBST: Now we're going to
get catty.

131
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:23,211
Who does not deserve to be an
all-star?

132
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,088
Not an easy question to
answer... in front of each

133
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:30,760
other.
Reveal.

134
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,595
It was a tie.
Shii Ann.

135
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,889
>> Surprise.
>> PROBST: Alicia.

136
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,432
>> Nice.
Hearing that from the rest of

137
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:37,725
the tribe, what's that make
you feel?

138
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,727
>> Yeah, it's a shot in the
heart.

139
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,437
I'll get them all later.
>> PROBST: Well, everybody got

140
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,772
it right.
Everybody gets a chop.

141
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,232
We'll start on the end and
work down.

142
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,109
>> Well, since my own tribe
mates think I don't deserve

143
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,821
to be here, Rob...
you're going first.

144
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:54,283
>> PROBST: Rob takes a hit.
>> How do you like that, baby?

>> I'm going to go with Big Tom.

>> PROBST: Big Tom takes his
second hit.

147
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,124
One hit away from being out of
the game.

148
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,293
Shii Ann.
>> Hey, Alicia, I got to pay

149
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,421
you back.
>> All right.

150
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,257
>> PROBST: Amber.
>> I'll go with Jenna.

151

first hit.

Rupert.
>> I'm sorry, Shii Ann.

Shii Ann and Big Tom one hit
away from being out of the game.

154
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,140
Big Tom.
>> Jenna, I'll just pay you

155
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,977
a favor.
Right back to you, baby.

156
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,145
>> PROBST: Jenna takes her
second hit.

157
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,648
Boston Rob, you could put
somebody out of the game if you

158
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:32,113
wanted.
>> Rupert hasn't gotten hit yet.

159
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,865
>> Oh...

160
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,451

casualty!

>> That's rotten.
>> PROBST: Have a seat on the

162

You're out of the game.

Next question: "Who uses sex
appeal as a weapon?"

164
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:49,130
Nobody even hesitating on this
one; everybody flipping quickly.

165
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:53,634
Reveal.
Everybody says Amber, including

166
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,387
Amber.
(<i> laughter</i> )

167
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,223
So you fully own up to using sex
appeal.

168
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,642
>> I fully own up to it.
>> PROBST: Everybody gets a chop

169
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,935
again.
Alicia, you're up.

170
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,355
>> Amber, since you're going to
use it as a weapon, how about...

171
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,357
>> PROBST: Amber going to take
her first hit.

172
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:12,695
>> PROBST: Jenna.
>> And payback.

173
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,156
>> PROBST: Amber takes her
second hit.

174
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,116
Shii Ann, you going to put
her out?

175
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,827
>> This is hard.
Rupert doesn't have one, but,

176
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,414
Jenna, I have to take you out
just because.

177
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,167
>> PROBST: And with that, Jenna
was completely beheaded.

178
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,212
Amber's got some payback.
>> Sorry, Alicia.

179
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,381
>> Hey, it's all right.
>> PROBST: Alicia takes her

180
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,550
second hit.
Rupert, why are you laughing?

181
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:37,345
>> Shii Ann, she's got to stop
telling people to hit me.

182
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:40,389
>> PROBST: Uh-oh.
(<i> others groaning</i> )

183
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,099
>> Oh...!
>> PROBST: Shii Ann takes it

184
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,226
right between the eyes.
Boston Rob.

185
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,687
>> No need in keeping the
stragglers around.

186
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:50,733
>> All right, go ahead.
(<i> others groaning</i> )

187
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,652
>> PROBST: Bye-bye, Alicia.
We are down to three.

188
00:10:53,736 --> 00:11:02,078
Who is under the false
assumption that they are smart?

189
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,580
Reveal.
Amber says Tom.

190
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:07,249
Rupert says himself.
Boston Rob says Jenna.

191
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,586
You're all wrong.
The group thought Alicia was

192
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,922
most under the false assumption
that she was smart.

193
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,091
>> I don't like these people
anymore, let me tell you

194
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,093
something.
>> PROBST: You're taking some

195
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,095
hits today.
>> I'm taking some hits today,

196
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,554
that's all right.
>> PROBST: Next question.

197
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:24,058
Who did the group think was the
most honest?

198
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:27,478
Reveal.
Amber and Rupert say Rupert.

199
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,772
Rob said himself.
Correct answer, Rupert.

200
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,149
Amber and Rupert are right.
Amber, you are up.

201
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:36,278
You only have two choices.
Boston Rob has taken one hit,

202
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:40,658
Rupert has taken no hits.
>> Sorry, Rob.

203
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,993
>> PROBST: Rob down to his
last pop.

204
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,912
Rupert could put him out of the
game right here.

205
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:47,581
>> I have to.
>> You could put her out.

206
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,751
>> I could, but Amber didn't
hit me.

207
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,629
>> Oh!
>> PROBST: Boston Rob is no

208
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:56,590
more.
Boston Rob, have a seat.

209
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,051
Here's where we're at.
Rupert, you still have three

210
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,220
hits left.
Amber, you only have one.

211
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,597
If Rupert gets this right, he
will obliterate you and win

212
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:07,268
the challenge.
"Who never shuts up?"

213
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:10,271
Reveal.
You both say Jenna.

214
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,481
>> Yeah.
>> PROBST: You're both right.

215
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,316
(<i> laughter</i> )
Amber, your hit doesn't really

216
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,985
matter.
Rupert, you get the final

217
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,820
honors.
Take Amber out.

218
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:23,325
>> Nice job, Rupert.
>> Thank you all, you guys.

219
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,537
>> PROBST: Rupert, with that,
wins reward.

220
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,331
Rupert, you will be in charge of
the menu tonight.

221
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,125
The boat will come and pick
you up.

222
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,877
You guys can now head back
to camp.

223
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:42,970
♪ ♪
>> You guys gave that one to me.

224
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:52,062
♪ ♪
>> You guys gave that one to me.

225
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,064
I appreciate that one.
Thank you, guys.

226
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,193
>> That was awesome.
>> I think the biggest

227
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,028
thing that happened at our
reward challenge today was,

228
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,072
Alicia got all upset again.
She was mocked by the tribe as

229
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,658
the person least deserving to be
an all-star.

230
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:08,370
Her ego took a blow, but you
know, people say things for a

231
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:14,210
reason, so maybe she needs to
take a look at herself.

232
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,087
I thought they were pretty good.
The, uh... the masks, too.

233
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,549
>> I thought the masks
were pretty good.

234
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,180
>> You know, it's never
fun to hear things about

235
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,682
yourself that aren't flattering
and then have to... the same

236
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,227
people that said those things,
you're stuck with them.

237
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,313
That's not fun.
>> It would be nice to get out

238
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:37,483
of camp tonight.
Alicia, you okay?

239
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,985
>> I'm fabulous, baby.
>> Okay. If it helps, I'm

240
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,029
a big mouth.
>> Yeah, but did everybody

241
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,698
say that you don't deserve to
be here and that you definitely

242
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,575
think you're smart and you're
not?

243
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:50,412
Did people say that about you?
>> Let's say there's only seven.

244
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,081
Let's say....
>> It doesn't matter, dude.

245
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,749
It's already been said. Done.
>> Alicia's very emotional.

246
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:56,293
And when something upsets her,
she becomes a huge grump around

247
00:13:56,377 --> 00:14:00,422
the camp.
She's just being a big baby

248
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,424
about it.
People are observing it.

249
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,592
People are getting annoyed
with it.

250
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,594
People will vote you out sooner
because they don't want to

251
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,888
live with it.
>> Don't, don't, don't, don't.

252
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,765
>> I know you don't want
somebody to talk to you, but

253
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,725
I'm a mom, it's my job.
>> Yeah, but you know what?

254
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,394
You're not my mom, so it's
all good.

255
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,729
>> But you're hurt.
>> Well, you know what?

256
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,941
That's just the way it goes.
I don't want anybody hugging me

257
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,111
or touching me or trying to...
Leave me alone.

258
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,114
The only person that tried to
not give me my space was Jenna.

259
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,782
Jenna's trying to put her arm
around me.

260
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:29,451
Give me a break.
Jenna and I have no connection

261
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,412
at all.
I mean, she's probably one of

262
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,330
the people that voted that way
anyway.

263
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:36,542
So she needs to save it.
Jenna would be the last person

264
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:41,797
that I would go to for
consoling, the last person.

265
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,967
>> Listen, I know you got a
really big decision, and I

266
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,429
know you're the most generous
person out here, probably.

267
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:51,640
And just know that we understand
where your position is.

268
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,642
But I'd like to have the choice
is all I'm asking.

269
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,146
>> Okay. That's a great idea.
>> Like if you said, "This is my

270
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,690
decision for the order," and
then just give us choices.

271
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:03,027
>> That's a great idea.
You know, that's almost a

272
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,448
challenge I wish I didn't win.
This is what killed me on Pearl

273
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:11,577
Islands was, I let the pecking
order be known and then I was

274
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,581
the next one gone.
>> But don't be a martyr and be

275
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,334
like, "I'm going to take the
smallest one and put everyone

276
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,170
else above me 'cause you need to
be strong, too, okay?

277
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,881
I just don't think you should
give away your big one.

278
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:28,010
I love Rupert, but strategy-
wise, he is-- I don't want to

279
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:31,347
say not good at the game, he is,
but he needs some coaching.

280
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,682
>> Seven of us...
>> I do say Shii Ann gets the

281
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,143
rice.
>> Shii Ann gets the rice.

282
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,854
>> But I think we keep ourselves
strong, us four.

283
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:41,023
We have the numbers.
>> They can't hurt us.

284
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,859
>> No, they can't.
>> This adventure is geared to

285
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:46,737
create hard feelings between
people.

286
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:52,701
I hate being that person that
creates the hard feelings.

287
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:03,671
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!
Welcome to the Romantica

288
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,381
Restaurant.
>> Thank you.

289
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,216
>> PROBST: Rupert, you're at the
head of the table.

290
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,051
>> Cool.
>> PROBST: Everybody else head

291
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:17,059
in this way and take a seat.
So, Rupert, it's your reward.

292
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,728
Good news is, you get your first
choice of anything here you

293
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,148
want.
We got a big piece of steak,

294
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:27,069
shrimp, all the fixings.
The bad news is, you have to

295
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:30,072
allocate the rest and somebody's
going to end up with a very cold

296
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,449
bowl of rice and water from
your own camp.

297
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,077
So, let me go over the rest of
your choices.

298
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,415
We have potatoes with tap water.
Then we have a salad with tap

299
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,292
water that's been chilled.
And we have a ham and cheese

300
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,212
sandwich with some sparkling
water and a little bit of lemon.

301
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,923
We also have a hot dog, sour
kraut and orange juice.

302
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:50,592
Then we have a big cheeseburger
and french fry plate.

303
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,470
So, you can start with myself.
You can start anywhere you want.

304
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:57,015
>> I'm going to start with me
and I'm taking the steak.

305
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:01,729
>> PROBST: All right.
>> Thank you, sir.

306
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:05,983
>> PROBST: Along with the steak,
open bar, for you only.

307
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,277
You just tell him what you want
to drink and he'll keep

308
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,612
refilling it.
>> We'll start with a cerveza.

309
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,489
>> PROBST: All right.
Rupert's starting with a beer.

310
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,616
So, this is on you.
It's your menu.

311
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,787
You're going to distribute it.
>> I would like Rob to choose

312
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:23,417
next.
>> PROBST: One ice-cold cola and

313
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,753
the burger.
>> I'd like Jenna to choose

314
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:29,089
next.
>> PROBST: Going right down the

315
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,341
line.
Orange juice.

316
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,594
>> I would like Amber to choose
next.

317
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,974
>> PROBST: Ham and cheese
sandwich, sparkling water.

318
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:40,517
All right, Rupert, three items
left.

319
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,187
>> Alicia?
>> I would love the salad.

320
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,815
>> PROBST: Salad and cold water.
>> Thank you.

321
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,484
I probably would have chose
that.

322
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:52,112
>> Very good.
>> PROBST: That worked out.

323
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,032
>> Big Tom, what do you want?
>> PROBST: Big Tom picks next.

324
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,283
>> Whatever...
What is that?

325
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,160
>> Potatoes.
>> I'll eat some potatoes.

326
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,162
Potatoes, yeah.
>> Leave the Asian girl with

327
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,955
the rice.
>> Yeah.

328
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,208
(<i> chuckling</i> )
>> We went to one of the

329
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,961
fanciest restaurants.
They said it was five-star.

330
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,506
>> Please don't stab me.
(<i> chuckling</i> )

331
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,550
>> But I wouldn't hit a dog
in the hind end with it 'cause

332
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,678
I got a tater and it was cold.
>> Shii Ann... camp.

333
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,223
>> PROBST: Camp water and cold
rice.

334
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,518
>> I hope it's boiled, both the
rice and the camp water.

335
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,520
>> PROBST: A little bit of an
awkward dinner, but it's a

336
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,356
dinner nonetheless.
You're warm for a little while.

337
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,691
I'll get out of your hair.
Bon appétit.

338
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:36,240
>> Thank you, Jeff.
>> This camp water tastes better

339
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,325
out here because of the romantic
lighting.

340
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:41,912
>> Good.
>> You saw the people that

341
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:45,082
ended up with fifth, sixth and
seventh weren't too happy about

342
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,876
the politics that were involved,
but hey, what can you do

343
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,713
about that?
You win some, you lose some.

344
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:58,971
>> Those fries look so good.
>> Thank you, sir.

345
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,598
>> I'm chewing my rice
and thinking that I'm eating

346
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,059
that piece of steak that
Rupert's holding in his hands.

347
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,436
>> I can't even look up at
you guys.

348
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,397
>> Don't look up.
Just eat.

349
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,525
Shii Ann's an absolutely
obnoxious person.

350
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,277
The whole time she's like, "This
rice is good.

351
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,737
Oh, my gosh, ooh, look at that
steak, I just want to watch you

352
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,533
eat it."
>> I wish I could give you guys

353
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,076
all some.
>> I know.

354
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:24,705
>> Shut up!
It's obnoxious!

355
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:32,421
>> Thank you, sir.
(<i> chuckling</i> )

356
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,841
Big Tom, I'm drinking this
for you.

357
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:54,651
(<i> Rupert burping</i> )
>> So the dinner was nice.

358
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:59,281
And Rupert, of course, had eight
or nine beers and he was

359
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,618
plastered.
Plastered!

360
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:07,122
>> Thank you, sir.
(<i> burping</i> )

361
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:11,793
>> Smell your napkin.
>> It's so nice and soft.

362
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,962
(<i> Rupert laughing</i> )
>> I'm taking...

363
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,173
We're taking advantage of this.
>> Good.

364
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,300
>> Rupert, keep drinking.
>> Okay.

365
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,636
>> We really wanted to stay at
the restaurant for as long as

366
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,138
we possibly could, 'cause we
just dreaded coming back here

367
00:20:23,221 --> 00:20:25,474
with all the bugs and the really
long night.

368
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,143
So, we told Rupert, "Keep
drinking as much as you want."

369
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,312
We're just going to lay here on
the table and use these napkins

370
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,773
as pillows and enjoy it.
>> Rupert's a happy man.

371
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:37,486
(<i> Rupert chuckling</i> )
>> Basically, Rupert

372
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:41,448
exposed our alliance of four.
It was pretty evident, uh...

373
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:45,160
as to who got what food.
He's kind of sticking it in

374
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:48,163
their face, which kind of shows
me that he does trust myself and

375
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:58,256
Amber to a degree.
>> ♪ Chaboga Mogo, Chaboga

376
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:08,892
Amber to a degree.
>> ♪ Chaboga Mogo, Chaboga

377
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:17,526
Mogo, Chaboga Mogo... ♪
The sun is out, and we're going

378
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:21,363
to have a beautiful day.
>> We are going to have a

379
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:33,917
beautiful day.
>> I'm going to battle 'cause

380
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,421
I got to, but I'm not going
to kill myself to win 'cause

381
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:40,090
I hope that I'm not on the
chopping block.

382
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,509
>> I don't think you are.
>> And I wouldn't mind seeing

383
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:45,053
you win immunity.
>> You got to be looking at Rob.

384
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,055
I would be if I were you.
>> Oh, my gosh...

385
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,891
>> If I were anyone here, I'd
would be looking at Rob.

386
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,268
>> I've already talked to Jenna
about that.

387
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,895
>> Of course, you have.
>> But they're telling me

388
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,522
they'll take me to the final
four, too, but I know I'll be

389
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,232
fourth unless I win immunity.
>> There are people here

390
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:59,276
that would stretch their vote
tonight if they felt like they

391
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,610
had the majority.
>> Yeah.

392
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,320
>> We know that.
>> I know that.

393
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,948
>> There are people here.
>> Let me... hand me...

394
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,533
while you're over, give me
that solid piece!

395
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,201
See that good little piece
right here?

396
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:12,581
>> Yep.
So, uh... who's up on the...?

397
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,332
>> Chop block?
>> Yep.

398
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,377
>> (<i> whispering</i> ): It's him
before Shii Ann.

399
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,547
>> Rupert before Shii Ann.
I was thinking about that today.

400
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,924
I was looking at everybody
today, and I was kind of...

401
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,218
sizing up.
>> All I'm saying, we got...

402
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,763
me and you got to stick
together, Alicia.

403
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,182
>> Absolutely.
And I'll tell you what, though,

404
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:33,477
if either one of us are up
against Amber or Boston Rob,

405
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,104
we're in trouble.
>> But you know as well as I do,

406
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,440
me and you are the lone horse
here.

407
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,484
>> Yep.
And those two are going to stick

408
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,110
together no matter what.
>> They're lovers.

409
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,029
>> I know.
>> But you know what?

410
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,823
We may have not slept together,
but we... we snuggled pretty

411
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:50,327
close.
>> That's right.

412
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,455
We decided, Big Tom, Rob, Amber
and myself, that we were going

413
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,332
to stay together to the very
end.

414
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:58,126
That's four people.
So, no matter what happens in

415
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,921
this tribe, we are four to the
to the other three.

416
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:03,131
Then there's Big Tom.
He came to me and said, you

417
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,426
know, "I can't sit next to
Boston Rob or Amber.

418
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,470
I'll never win.
Maybe I should sit next to you."

419
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,430
And I said, "You know what?
Maybe you're right."

420
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,140
But I didn't make any deal
with him.

421
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,309
The only person I have an
alliance with at this point is

422
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:17,646
Boston Rob, and we shook on it.
But do I trust him?

423
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,315
Absolutely not.
>> Here's the thing.

424
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,150
If Shii Ann wins immunity
today...

425
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,820
>> It'd be a miracle.
>> Yeah, I know, but still, we

426
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,155
have to decide.
>> Rob, let's just face it,

427
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,116
it's gonna hurt you more than
it will me.

428
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,451
You got a better chance at
winning than I have.

429
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,663
>> I need to win, like,
almost every one, Tom.

430
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,540
I know what people think around
the camp.

431
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,042
I know even though Rupert
pretends he's all nice-- last

432
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,670
night he gave me a hamburger--
I can read beyond that,

433
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,964
you know?
If Shii Ann wins immunity, I

434
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,341
don't know who we're gonna
kick off.

435
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:47,884
>> You're worried about
Shii Ann.

436
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,637
I'm worried about Rupert.
Because he's the one that's

437
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,640
gonna beat you in an immunity.
Shii Ann ain't gonna beat you.

438
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,851
>> All right.
>> Uh, Alicia ain't gonna

439
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:59,688
beat you.
But we can't beat Rupert.

440
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,190
You're gonna come close, but
he's gonna beat you before

441
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,358
it's over.
>> Right.

442
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,861
>> And then when he does, you
know who they want to get

443
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,487
rid of?
It ain't gonna be me.

444
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,699
>> No, it'll be me.
>> It's you.

445
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,409
>> Yeah, we should talk,
actually.

446
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:16,163
I have some news.
>> I don't want to even hear it.

447
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,206
Honestly.
>> That's fine.

448
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,084
>> There is a plan, Shii Ann,
and it's too late for anything

449
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:24,588
to change.
>> Okay. I appreciate that.

450
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:34,681
>> Yep.
>> PROBST: There's no denying

451
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:41,521
>> Yep.
>> PROBST: There's no denying

452
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,566
it-- we are getting down to it.
There are seven of you left.

453
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,610
Today's challenge is for
immunity.

454
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,695
Very important at this stage
of the game.

455
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,614
It's a very simple immunity
challenge.

456
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,782
You're gonna step up on a log.
You're gonna raise your hand

457
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,659
over your head.
Your hand is gonna be tethered

458
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,703
to a bucket.
That bucket's full of water.

459
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,789
When you drop your hand, the
bucket tips, you get wet,

460
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,250
you're done.
If you need immunity, the only

461
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,420
thing stopping you from getting
it is quitting, and that's it.

462
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:08,298
We got all day to sit out here.
All right, Boston Rob, give

463
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:15,138
it up.
The all-important immunity is

464
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,265
back up for grabs.
Take your spots.

465
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:22,604
I'll lock you in.
For immunity.

466
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:26,983
Everybody's locked in, and this
challenge is officially on.

467
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,402
There'll be a little initial
pain.

468
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:33,615
You'll work through that.
Just remember, there's not a lot

469
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:37,077
of slack in that chain, so if
you drop your hand two inches,

470
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,622
you're done.
You have very little wiggle room

471
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:50,632
in this challenge.
Amber's first out.

472
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:56,972
in this challenge.
Amber's first out.

473
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:04,938
Grab a seat on the bench.
>> I didn't even move!

474
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:08,108
>> PROBST: Jenna's out of the
game.

475
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,318
>> You didn't need that immunity
anyway.

476
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,822
It's all good.
>> Nobody knows who's safe.

477
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,991
>> I know I'm not safe, that's
for sure.

478
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:19,244
>> PROBST: Have a seat next to
Amber.

479
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:31,256
Big Tom, you're struggling.
>> Oh, Big Tom.

480
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,675

let out this victory cry, and

00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:40,239
created an island for yourself.
>> This tribe is very

640
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:43,284
unique in that they've been
very, very open with me about

641
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,412
the fact that they are a tight
alliance and I'm going home

642
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:49,123
next.
So, you know, today at the

643
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:52,627
challenge, I was very vocal,
because I'm going to try my best

644
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,588
to fight.
>> PROBST: Rupert, what's your

645
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,423
take on everything that went
down today?

646
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:00,968
>> That was one heck of
a hard challenge.

647
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,931
After 20 minutes, I was dying.
Shii Ann says she was the only

648
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:08,309
one that needed it, but now
somebody else needs it.

649
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:11,145
There's been talk that I'm
targeted.

650
00:37:11,228 --> 00:37:14,941
I felt like, especially with
that silly reward challenge over

651
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:20,363
the pecking-order<i> caca,</i> I'm up.
I mean, my number could be up.

652
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:23,783
>> PROBST: Alicia, we have four
from the original Chapera.

653
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:26,827
You guys have the numbers.
How strong is that group still?

654
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,830
>> Well, the original Chapera
is-is always going to be

655
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,250
strong because we've been
together from the day one, but

656
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:36,837
we also could not have done it
without Rupert and Jenna joining

657
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,840
our tribe.
Honestly, we knew that once we

658
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:43,886
got to six, game on.
Anything can happen and any one

659
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,680
of us is vulnerable at this
point.

660
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,682
>> PROBST: Shii Ann, did you
notice a power shift today?

661
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,184
Were you the person in camp
people wanted to come talk to

662
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,019
and try and make a deal?
>> No. I-I...

663
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:55,356
You know, it's so funny.
What I notice about this group

664
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:58,818
of six is that, as far as I can
tell, no one wants to take a

665
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:02,029
leadership position and say this
person in particular is getting

666
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,990
voted out tonight.
>> PROBST: Jenna, you were

667
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,908
rolling your head all over the
place.

668
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,827
>> 'Cause it makes us sound
dumb.

669
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,870
>> No, no, no, I don't
think...

670
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,872
>> PROBST: Hold off. Shii Ann.
>> I mean, maybe we're not

671
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,708
telling Shii Ann everything
because we don't need her to

672
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,919
know our strategies.
>> PROBST: Boston Rob, first

673
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,505
time in a while, you haven't had
that necklace around your neck.

674
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:22,883
You're a provider, very strong,
seem to be a likable guy.

675
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,219
Why not get rid of you while we
have the opportunity?

676
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:27,722
>> What are you giving
them ideas for, Jeff?

677
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,890
>> PROBST: It had to have
crossed your mind.

678
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,392
>> Of course.
Are you kidding me?

679
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:35,062
I'm sitting here, I won the
first two immunities, I've been

680
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,690
strong pretty much, I think, the
whole game.

681
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:40,735
I'm definitely nervous tonight,
and I wish I had that necklace

682
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,737
on.
>> PROBST: On that note, it's

683
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,239
time to vote.
Shii Ann, you have immunity.

684
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:48,576
I know you don't want to give it
away, but I'll go ahead and ask.

685
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,579
>> No, Jeff, I'm not
going to give it away.

686
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,539
>> PROBST: You cannot vote for
Shii Ann.

spoken.

708

>> PROBST: Well, Shii Ann was
very open tonight in sharing

709
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,193
that she was treated with
respect and honesty regarding

710
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:30,029
her status in the tribe.
Clearly, that doesn't apply to

711
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,781
members of your own family of
six, as Alicia never saw it

712
