1
00:00:01,801 --> 00:00:04,201
Previously on Survivor...

2
00:00:05,301 --> 00:00:06,915
At the Naviti,

3
00:00:07,165 --> 00:00:10,976
an alliance emerged that cut across 
the old divisions.

4
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:14,170
Hello, Wendell and Donathan. 
Wendell, sure.

5
00:00:14,295 --> 00:00:15,934
And their target was clear.

6
00:00:16,108 --> 00:00:19,027
It could be Chris. 
I'm ready for it.

7
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:22,131
The Malolos were preparing for the council.

8
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:24,676
The minority alliance 
thought itself lost.

9
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:25,901
It's gone badly.

10
00:00:26,084 --> 00:00:27,976
Then Michael revived hope.

11
00:00:28,101 --> 00:00:31,901
I found the original 
James idol in Survivor China.

12
00:00:32,998 --> 00:00:37,189
The worst mistake of any Survivor 
is James leaving with two idols.

13
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:40,131
I feel responsible 
for ending this curse,

14
00:00:40,256 --> 00:00:42,401
to this legacy, 
to play fair, this time.

15
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:43,901
Let's act!

16
00:00:45,101 --> 00:00:46,588
At the council,

17
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,476
Michael bluffed 
on the power of the idol...

18
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:53,276
She has the double power 
to save two people.

19
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:55,164
...and carried out his plan.

20
00:00:55,335 --> 00:00:58,532
All four of 
us are going to vote Bradley.

21
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:02,738
If any of you want to join us, all 
it takes is one vote.

22
00:01:02,988 --> 00:01:05,899
Finally, 
Michael made the wrong decision...

23
00:01:06,058 --> 00:01:07,521
I play it for Steph.

24
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,867
...and couldn't 
reverse the idol's curse...

25
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,676
...causing the departure 
of his closest ally.

26
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:16,463
Brendan, the tribe has spoken.

27
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:18,901
Thanks, Jeff.

28
00:01:19,201 --> 00:01:21,990
It was a real Survivor duel.

29
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,935
Naviti wins this round, 
but the question is:

30
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,276
can this tribe get over it, 
to avoid coming back here?

31
00:01:28,582 --> 00:01:30,059
There are 16 left.

32
00:01:30,184 --> 00:01:32,201
Who will be eliminated tonight?

33
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:47,201
What party !

34
00:01:47,988 --> 00:01:50,676
What a crazy first piece of advice!

35
00:01:50,801 --> 00:01:52,601
And how !

36
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:55,276
I was certain to be cooked.

37
00:01:55,401 --> 00:01:57,876
Tonight was an electroshock.

38
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:01,897
I thought I was leaving. I was sure of it.

39
00:02:02,061 --> 00:02:04,276
Everyone was trying to save their skin.

40
00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:05,176
Yeah.

41
00:02:05,301 --> 00:02:07,976
Some 
with a little more determination.

42
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:10,376
But I'm thrilled 
with the original Naviti.

43
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:14,101
Because if they hadn't 
followed the plan, I would have left.

44
00:02:15,392 --> 00:02:16,901
Nice canard, Michael.

45
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:19,076
Yes, I only had that.

46
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:21,717
Sorry if I hurt anyone.

47
00:02:21,884 --> 00:02:24,876
I hope you will understand 
our point of view.

48
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:27,401
I was doing everything I could.

49
00:02:27,572 --> 00:02:30,576
Michael has proven himself 
as a tough player.

50
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:33,595
So far I only saw him

51
00:02:33,752 --> 00:02:36,585
like a loving party animal 
hanging out with Jenna and Stephanie.

52
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,576
I had it all wrong.

53
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:43,713
Now all my Naviti allies 
see him as a huge threat.

54
00:02:44,201 --> 00:02:46,821
And so, it was a coin toss.

55
00:02:46,946 --> 00:02:49,376
He was a normal idol.

56
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:52,676
She could only save 
one of us four.

57
00:02:52,898 --> 00:02:56,376
Whatever I did 
was hit and miss.

58
00:02:56,501 --> 00:02:59,531
I appreciate your selflessness, Michael.

59
00:02:59,687 --> 00:03:01,576
You could have kept it to yourself.

60
00:03:01,701 --> 00:03:03,046
Yeah, you could have.

61
00:03:03,171 --> 00:03:04,293
Yeah.

62
00:03:04,471 --> 00:03:06,376
It was brave. 
Very.

63
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:08,376
It didn't turn out the way I expected.

64
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:11,476
I did my best 
to save the four

65
00:03:11,601 --> 00:03:14,803
by lying about James' idol. 
It was a bet.

66
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:17,601
This is my first big setback.

67
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:20,976
I doubt I have a trick to play 
on every advice,

68
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,156
so let's avoid... 
Yes, let's avoid!

69
00:03:23,281 --> 00:03:26,747
I hope it's us who will have 
a turn to play next time.

70
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,972
I don't believe I reversed 
a curse.

71
00:03:31,097 --> 00:03:32,955
I didn't play the idol well.

72
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:34,976
And I'm sorry.

73
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:38,758
But the council proved to me that 
we are the 3 at the bottom of the ladder.

74
00:03:38,883 --> 00:03:43,138
So after tonight, 
I have my work cut out.

75
00:03:57,622 --> 00:03:59,283
Over here, everyone!

76
00:04:05,301 --> 00:04:08,601
Naviti, 
discover the new Malolo tribe.

77
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:11,791
Brendan was eliminated 
at the last council.

78
00:04:16,274 --> 00:04:18,557
Ready for 
today's reward event?

79
00:04:19,701 --> 00:04:22,676
Today you will step over 
a series of plateaus.

80
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:26,246
Then you undo 
a pile of giant sandbags,

81
00:04:26,371 --> 00:04:27,676
revealing a lever.

82
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:31,246
Pulling 
it will release 60 smaller bags.

83
00:04:31,393 --> 00:04:33,876
Collaborating, 
you will bring them to the finish.

84
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:37,289
There you will throw them 
at a series of targets,

85
00:04:37,414 --> 00:04:40,465
spinning them 
to release a flag.

86
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:45,158
Three flags released 
and the reward is earned.

87
00:04:45,283 --> 00:04:47,376
Want to know what's at stake? 
Yes !

88
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:48,905
It's pretty straightforward.

89
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:51,401
Coffee and pastries.

90
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:56,776
Oh my God ! 
Lord ! Let's go!

91
00:04:56,901 --> 00:04:58,340
Cinnamon rolls!

92
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:02,376
Wow, Domenick, what a reaction! 
Food is scarce.

93
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:05,476
We have the fishing kit, 
but we're struggling.

94
00:05:05,601 --> 00:05:07,816
So it's all good to go.

95
00:05:07,989 --> 00:05:09,632
Clearly worth it.

96
00:05:09,757 --> 00:05:11,711
Moreover, the winning tribe

97
00:05:11,836 --> 00:05:15,276
will send one of the losers 
to Ghost Island.

98
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:17,192
The confrontation continues.

99
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:19,576
One minute of organization and here we go.

100
00:05:24,601 --> 00:05:27,201
Fine, here we go! 
For the reward!

101
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,014
Survivors, ready?

102
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:35,601
Everyone 
must step over the plateaus.

103
00:05:36,301 --> 00:05:37,801
Everybody !

104
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:42,484
Upright !

105
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,411
Come on, tough guys!

106
00:05:44,536 --> 00:05:45,760
It's good, Naviti!

107
00:05:45,885 --> 00:05:47,101
Malolo, it's good!

108
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,991
Now 
we have to undo this stack

109
00:05:50,241 --> 00:05:52,476
very heavy sandbags.

110
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,442
Looking for the lever. 
Unleash them!

111
00:05:55,613 --> 00:05:57,566
They are difficult to move.

112
00:05:57,739 --> 00:06:00,176
Bend your legs more!

113
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:04,087
Coffee and pastries to be won! 
Ghost Island in game!

114
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,601
The lever !

115
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:09,097
The Malolos see the lever. 
Yeah Dom! Here is the lever!

116
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,676
It's neck and neck.

117
00:06:10,801 --> 00:06:12,102
Prepare your arm!

118
00:06:12,227 --> 00:06:14,082
Get ready to pull this thing, 
we're running!

119
00:06:14,223 --> 00:06:16,257
The lever released, pull it,

120
00:06:16,382 --> 00:06:18,401
this will free the sandbags.

121
00:06:19,301 --> 00:06:21,076
Michael is there! PULL !

122
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:22,624
Its good ! Go for it !

123
00:06:22,801 --> 00:06:24,801
Malolo took the lead.

124
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:27,476
Naviti is there! Its good !

125
00:06:27,601 --> 00:06:29,290
Naviti is right behind.

126
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:32,301
Two people collect the bags.

127
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:35,003
The others throw them.

128
00:06:35,501 --> 00:06:38,901
The better organized you are, 
the faster it will go.

129
00:06:39,301 --> 00:06:41,510
For now, it's chaos.

130
00:06:41,686 --> 00:06:43,601
Bags are flying everywhere.

131
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:45,547
They should all be 
in the trash.

132
00:06:45,797 --> 00:06:48,476
Only then 
can you start shooting.

133
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:51,153
60 bags in all.

134
00:06:51,601 --> 00:06:53,822
It's Stephanie and Jenna for Malolo.

135
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:56,176
Chris and Wendell for Naviti.

136
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:58,601
Its good ? 
The Naviti have theirs.

137
00:06:58,726 --> 00:07:01,576
One more, Jenna! 
Chris will pitch for Naviti.

138
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:03,801
It hits the target straight away!

139
00:07:03,926 --> 00:07:05,176
Jenna, one more!

140
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,076
Is there one missing ! 
Everyone should be there!

141
00:07:08,201 --> 00:07:10,076
That's good, Malolo!

142
00:07:13,164 --> 00:07:14,478
Come on, sea bass!

143
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:17,690
Chris for Naviti...

144
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:19,776
Chris touches again!

145
00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:21,504
You have to hit the target

146
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:24,376
so that it unscrews 
and releases the flag.

147
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:26,595
First flag for Chris!

148
00:07:27,301 --> 00:07:28,423
Super know!

149
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:32,060
Right off the bat , 
Chris is wild for Naviti.

150
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,129
Sebastian tries to follow.

151
00:07:34,801 --> 00:07:36,537
It is far from it.

152
00:07:36,662 --> 00:07:38,276
Take your time, it's good!

153
00:07:40,051 --> 00:07:42,201
...has velocity.

154
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:44,401
Second flag for Chris!

155
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:46,001
Lord.

156
00:07:46,201 --> 00:07:48,009
He's on the third.

157
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:53,701
It seems easy with Chris 
while Sebastian struggles.

158
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:56,726
It is an exceptional arm!

159
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,176
One last shot!

160
00:07:58,336 --> 00:08:01,401
With Chris, 
it turns to correction!

161
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:04,101
And that's it, it's over!

162
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:07,892
I want these pastries!

163
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:10,671
Naviti wins the award!

164
00:08:10,796 --> 00:08:12,367
Coffee and pastries!

165
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:14,601
Cinnamon rolls!

166
00:08:14,846 --> 00:08:18,201
A resounding victory, 
thanks to the arm of Chris.

167
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,680
Chris, you clearly have 
a sporting background.

168
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,984
It happened to me to throw mines, 
in my youth.

169
00:08:30,378 --> 00:08:31,422
That's to say ?

170
00:08:31,547 --> 00:08:34,856
I played baseball in college. 
And I was a pitcher.

171
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:38,376
Nice effort. Result: 
a resounding victory for Naviti

172
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:40,262
and a great reward:

173
00:08:40,424 --> 00:08:43,176
coffee and pastries 
leave with you.

174
00:08:43,301 --> 00:08:47,476
Additionally, you will send someone 
from Malolo to Ghost Island.

175
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:48,670
Who ?

176
00:08:50,058 --> 00:08:51,876
The stones ? 
The stones.

177
00:08:52,001 --> 00:08:54,801
The stones. 
Without hesitation. Well, the stones.

178
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:58,608
Without looking.

179
00:09:00,198 --> 00:09:01,883
There is a white stone.

180
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:03,801
White Stone, Ghost Island.

181
00:09:04,797 --> 00:09:08,690
Sebastian has what's left. 
It really leaves it to chance.

182
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:11,897
Hold out your hands.

183
00:09:12,662 --> 00:09:14,101
Reveal !

184
00:09:15,814 --> 00:09:18,601
Stephanie has the white stone. 
Take your things.

185
00:09:19,076 --> 00:09:20,776
The boat will take you.

186
00:09:20,901 --> 00:09:24,576
You'll be back in time 
for the next immunity test.

187
00:09:24,701 --> 00:09:26,401
Goodbye ! 
See you soon !

188
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:30,376
Naviti, well done. 
Come take the reward.

189
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:31,777
Have a good time !

190
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,962
Prems for chocolate.

191
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:39,587
Well-deserved. 
Take your things, return to camp.

192
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:42,367
Malolo, nothing for you. 
Take your things, return to camp.

193
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:44,776
I was just me.

194
00:09:44,901 --> 00:09:48,522
And let's be honest, 
I was pretty hot today.

195
00:09:49,658 --> 00:09:51,976
I am a diamond in the rough. 
Do you see me shine?

196
00:09:52,101 --> 00:09:54,269
Come admire me, damn it! 
No need to pay.

197
00:09:54,401 --> 00:09:56,866
I always reach my goal, 
in one throw.

198
00:09:57,501 --> 00:09:58,903
That's all for me.

199
00:10:18,543 --> 00:10:21,177
I almost cried 
having to come here.

200
00:10:21,302 --> 00:10:24,084
For now, 
I'm at the bottom of the ladder,

201
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:26,677
with Michael and Jenna, 
at the Malolos

202
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:31,319
It worries me a bit to be here, 
separated from my group.

203
00:10:32,402 --> 00:10:35,309
In Survivor, 24 hours,

204
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,785
it can change everything.

205
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:41,282
However, I really think 
there is a reason for everything.

206
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,245
Go on !

207
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,865
And my goal, on Ghost Island,

208
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,077
is to turn the game around

209
00:10:47,202 --> 00:10:49,924
and hopefully 
gain an advantage.

210
00:10:52,453 --> 00:10:55,202
Good. So. What do we have here?

211
00:10:57,602 --> 00:10:59,902
"No, not today." 
No game for me!

212
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:03,346
Thin ! 
I needed an edge!

213
00:11:03,888 --> 00:11:07,575
When I got the message 
that I wouldn't play,

214
00:11:07,825 --> 00:11:10,902
let's be honest, 
my heart sank a little.

215
00:11:11,602 --> 00:11:12,736
Most...

216
00:11:13,242 --> 00:11:16,351
In times 
when I have to be brave,

217
00:11:16,602 --> 00:11:20,602
where I can show my children 
that I can do everything on my own...

218
00:11:22,202 --> 00:11:24,234
These are the times

219
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:26,140
where I take a deep breath

220
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:29,277
and imbues me with the strength 
that is within me.

221
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:32,700
Because I've been unhappy 
in the past.

222
00:11:33,094 --> 00:11:35,963
This is why 
I left the Mormon religion

223
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:39,702
and that I got divorced, 
all in six months.

224
00:11:40,153 --> 00:11:43,765
It was there that I discovered 
my true inner strength, and that...

225
00:11:44,591 --> 00:11:48,977
I believe in myself no 
matter what others do.

226
00:11:49,102 --> 00:11:51,302
That's the real strength in life.

227
00:11:51,702 --> 00:11:53,995
Now, single mother,

228
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,577
I can only rely on myself.

229
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,877
And I want to 
channel this inner strength

230
00:12:00,002 --> 00:12:03,277
Cause I'm ready to go back 
and kick some ass,

231
00:12:03,402 --> 00:12:06,402
with a clear vision 
and a clear mind.

232
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:15,277
Are we grilling or what? 
Yeah !

233
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,869
I would like chocolate. 
Good.

234
00:12:17,994 --> 00:12:22,077
But if someone wants us to share, 
no problem.

235
00:12:22,202 --> 00:12:24,377
Quick little war cry!

236
00:12:24,866 --> 00:12:27,477
At three ! One two three...

237
00:12:27,602 --> 00:12:32,177
Chris took a great victory 
that impressed us all.

238
00:12:32,302 --> 00:12:34,902
That's three straight wins.

239
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,198
Serve yourself ! 
Chocolate.

240
00:12:37,347 --> 00:12:39,677
They must be collapsed. 
Yeah.

241
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:41,636
Physically, he is an asset.

242
00:12:41,805 --> 00:12:44,372
Moreover, he is 
much more willing

243
00:12:44,622 --> 00:12:47,078
to work with us, 
the four Malolos.

244
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,090
Have Chris with us

245
00:12:49,215 --> 00:12:52,102
means that now 
we decide.

246
00:12:58,021 --> 00:13:00,402
First cup! 
Damn it !

247
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,277
My friends !

248
00:13:02,735 --> 00:13:04,477
We have tough guys here!

249
00:13:04,602 --> 00:13:08,471
Mission accomplished. 
Let's enjoy this afternoon coffee!

250
00:13:10,514 --> 00:13:13,088
First, the victory enchanted me.

251
00:13:13,213 --> 00:13:16,077
But then this stuff 
made me think of home.

252
00:13:16,202 --> 00:13:18,902
It reminded me of 
my mother and my grandmother.

253
00:13:24,002 --> 00:13:26,080
Do you want company 
or be alone?

254
00:13:26,241 --> 00:13:28,153
Yes, sit down. 
Good.

255
00:13:29,402 --> 00:13:32,702
Can I tell you something? 
Gladly.

256
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,510
Coffee and all that...

257
00:13:35,762 --> 00:13:38,502
It really reminded me of home.

258
00:13:38,627 --> 00:13:41,514
Reminds me of... home.

259
00:13:42,402 --> 00:13:44,690
In fact, 
I take care of my grandmother.

260
00:13:44,815 --> 00:13:46,426
She had two strokes.

261
00:13:47,002 --> 00:13:48,785
And today...

262
00:13:49,864 --> 00:13:52,577
It worries me. 
I am sorry.

263
00:13:52,702 --> 00:13:55,666
Sometimes I feel guilty for being here. 
Why ?

264
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,877
Because it's more work 
for my mother.

265
00:13:58,002 --> 00:14:00,308
Imagine watching this with them.

266
00:14:00,433 --> 00:14:01,666
Yes, I rejoice.

267
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,522
They will be super proud of you.

268
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:05,777
My grandmother is my life.

269
00:14:05,902 --> 00:14:08,777
She is sick 
and my mother is disabled.

270
00:14:08,902 --> 00:14:11,277
So I feel a little guilty 
for being here.

271
00:14:11,402 --> 00:14:13,977
I left them. 
For my mother, it is heavy.

272
00:14:14,102 --> 00:14:16,864
My family does not want to get 
involved and help.

273
00:14:17,114 --> 00:14:21,177
I don't drink coffee, 
but since they like it...

274
00:14:21,302 --> 00:14:23,102
It's a bit like home.

275
00:14:25,002 --> 00:14:28,002
You're so sweet. 
Don't feel bad about it.

276
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:31,177
I trust your discretion. 
Lord, yes!

277
00:14:31,473 --> 00:14:32,747
It was very tough.

278
00:14:33,302 --> 00:14:36,077
Donathan was a little affected.

279
00:14:36,202 --> 00:14:38,773
I saw the opportunity

280
00:14:38,898 --> 00:14:40,587
to take a step towards him,

281
00:14:40,712 --> 00:14:43,443
because it's probably with him,

282
00:14:43,568 --> 00:14:46,294
of the four Malolos, 
with whom I spoke the least.

283
00:14:46,443 --> 00:14:48,777
I know you have a problem.

284
00:14:48,902 --> 00:14:51,232
This is our first 
face-to-face moment.

285
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:55,002
It's hard to be so long 
away from my mother and my grandma.

286
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:57,277
My mother is in a nursing home.

287
00:14:57,402 --> 00:14:59,202
For seven to eight years.

288
00:15:00,102 --> 00:15:03,677
I have to go there 
to take care of her.

289
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:07,815
At 15, I gave him his pills, 
took him to the bathroom...

290
00:15:08,002 --> 00:15:11,477
We want 
to be a teenager, a young adult.

291
00:15:11,602 --> 00:15:15,302
But at the same time, we have to 
sacrifice some things to...

292
00:15:15,702 --> 00:15:19,077
...Caring for those 
who cared for you.

293
00:15:19,202 --> 00:15:21,496
I told him about my mother,

294
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:24,502
thinking it was a good way 
to get closer,

295
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,301
to build a real relationship, 
real ties.

296
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:31,602
As a child, I didn't understand 
much about it.

297
00:15:31,902 --> 00:15:33,902
It was frustrating and hard.

298
00:15:34,127 --> 00:15:37,277
But as soon as my mom was told 
she had two months left,

299
00:15:37,402 --> 00:15:39,452
that day, I was 17 years old,

300
00:15:39,577 --> 00:15:41,585
I decided to become better.

301
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,077
Hear his story

302
00:15:43,202 --> 00:15:46,402
that like me, he had to 
take responsibility...

303
00:15:46,802 --> 00:15:49,777
I can 
only understand and sympathize.

304
00:15:49,902 --> 00:15:51,502
I lived it.

305
00:15:51,902 --> 00:15:56,377
Sacrificing what you have sacrificed 
takes a lot of courage.

306
00:15:56,502 --> 00:15:58,044
For that, I respect you.

307
00:15:58,402 --> 00:16:02,377
Laurel wants to work with Wendell 
and Domenick to get Chris out.

308
00:16:02,502 --> 00:16:04,777
I want to support Laurel.

309
00:16:04,902 --> 00:16:07,375
But I got closer to Chris.

310
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,877
I'm a little in the middle, 
pulled from all sides.

311
00:16:11,002 --> 00:16:13,514
I have to choose 
what is best for me.

312
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:16,786
This is when I have 
to start thinking about Donathan.

313
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:37,841
Over here, everyone!

314
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:48,619
And this is Stephanie, 
back from Ghost Island.

315
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:54,519
Health !

316
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,369
Hello family !

317
00:16:56,494 --> 00:16:59,045
Ready for 
today's immunity test?

318
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,645
First, 
I take back the immunity idol.

319
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,770
And here.

320
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,545
Once again, 
immunity is at stake.

321
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,845
Today 
you will cross a pontoon bridge,

322
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,409
carrying a bodyboard 
tied to a rope.

323
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,813
You will take a bag 
and you will hold on.

324
00:17:19,063 --> 00:17:21,749
The others 
will operate a giant wheel,

325
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,270
bringing you back to shore.

326
00:17:25,012 --> 00:17:28,170
The 3 bags together, with the numbered discs 
they contain,

327
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,945
you will solve a combination, 
getting a key

328
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,761
which will release a sliding puzzle.

329
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,845
The first tribe that completes the puzzle

330
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:42,245
wins immunity, 
is immune from voting.

331
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,605
The losers: 
on the council, someone will be

332
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,245
the fifth person 
eliminated from the game.

333
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,638
One minute of organization 
and we get started.

334
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,476
Well, on and go.

335
00:17:58,706 --> 00:18:00,020
For immunity.

336
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,870
Survivors, ready?

337
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:06,445
Come on Wendell!

338
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:10,445
Wendell pour Naviti, 
Chelsea pour Malolo.

339
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:14,045
You have to go for it with this bodyboard 
and manage the rope well.

340
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,745
Come on Chelsea! 
Great !

341
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,974
You have to go get a bag,

342
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,045
then your tribe will bring you back.

343
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,745
Keep it up, Chelsea, great! 
Come on Wendell!

344
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,845
Wendell leads, 
but Chelsea is hot on his heels.

345
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,245
Wendell unties his bag. 
Yeah, Wendell!

346
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,370
He has it.

347
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,545
And a bit of surfing at the Survivor!

348
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,545
Go on !

349
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,445
Wendell is in the water, ready.

350
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,493
The Navitis begin to spin.

351
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,470
Meet Wendell! 
That's how we do it!

352
00:18:46,254 --> 00:18:47,381
Go on !

353
00:18:47,506 --> 00:18:49,045
We push ! 
We pump!

354
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,845
Wendell is back.

355
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,274
Chelsea has her bag, 
she's in the water.

356
00:18:53,652 --> 00:18:55,570
The Malolo begin to turn.

357
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,670
Come on, let's push! 
Come on Chelsea!

358
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,970
Wendell 
brings back the first Naviti bag.

359
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:05,970
Go ahead, Naviti!

360
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,945
Come on, Libby! 
Go on !

361
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,682
Chelsea is here! 
Course !

362
00:19:09,807 --> 00:19:10,953
Come on, Chelsea!

363
00:19:11,948 --> 00:19:13,627
You go-y ! 
Allez-y, Malolo!

364
00:19:13,877 --> 00:19:15,329
Desiree rushes forward.

365
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,345
Naviti leads. 
Come on, Libby!

366
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:21,397
Slowly and surely! 
Take your time, stay straight!

367
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,436
Come on, Lib! 
Libby slows down on the bridge.

368
00:19:26,561 --> 00:19:29,443
Come on, Des! 
An opportunity for Malolo.

369
00:19:29,693 --> 00:19:31,445
Stay straight! 
Come on, Des!

370
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,393
Desiree swallows the deck now!

371
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:35,827
Go, Libby, go!

372
00:19:35,952 --> 00:19:37,838
Libby lost the lead

373
00:19:37,963 --> 00:19:39,770
that Naviti had taken.

374
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,411
The two women 
arrive at the same time.

375
00:19:42,536 --> 00:19:43,390
On and go.

376
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,962
They untie the bags.

377
00:19:45,087 --> 00:19:46,860
The tribes are ready to fire.

378
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,245
Hold on tight, Libby!

379
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,770
Libby is in the water, 
she's leading again.

380
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,970
The Naviti bring her back.

381
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,670
Yes ! Yes ! 
Push hard!

382
00:19:57,978 --> 00:19:59,955
Push hard! 
That's good, Des!

383
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,045
Desiree loses her board!

384
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,316
She is under water.

385
00:20:05,727 --> 00:20:06,880
She's on it?

386
00:20:07,801 --> 00:20:08,713
Go on !

387
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,270
Can it hold underwater?

388
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,170
Wow !

389
00:20:16,427 --> 00:20:17,682
Libby is back.

390
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,245
Real Survivor style surfing!

391
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,825
It's neck and neck 
in this event.

392
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,216
Go ahead, Wendell!

393
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,245
Come on Wendell!

394
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,345
Wendell leaves for Naviti.

395
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,217
Desiree... Go ahead! 
It will be Chelsea again.

396
00:20:33,342 --> 00:20:34,180
Course !

397
00:20:34,305 --> 00:20:37,374
Second round trip 
for Wendell and Chelsea.

398
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,645
Both are out of breath.

399
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:40,845
The balance !

400
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,045
Come on Chelsea! 
Yeah, Chelsea!

401
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,045
Come on, Wendell, it's good!

402
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,454
Wendell unties the third bag.

403
00:20:47,617 --> 00:20:49,385
It's fine, don't worry!

404
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,145
Chelsea slows down.

405
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,670
She falls in the water.

406
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,770
An opportunity for Naviti.

407
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:00,470
Chelsea came back up.

408
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,332
Everything you have!

409
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,677
Wendell is ready, 
start shooting him!

410
00:21:05,802 --> 00:21:06,870
Go on !

411
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,170
Push harder!

412
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,245
Great job 
from James, Domenick and Laurel!

413
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,316
Go on !

414
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:19,170
Great ! 
Wendell brings back the third bag.

415
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,770
Go ahead, Naviti!

416
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:25,045
They can attack 
the combination lock.

417
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,145
Come on, Chelsea!

418
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,445
Chelsea has her bag, she's in the water.

419
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,456
Go on !

420
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,207
Chelsea is in the water, 
pulled sideways.

421
00:21:34,647 --> 00:21:36,945
Upside down, she loses the board!

422
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,245
New setback for Malolo.

423
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:41,452
Come on, Chelsea!

424
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,715
That's good, Chelsea!

425
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:48,445
James and Domenick 
look for the combination.

426
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,445
It's good. 
Go on !

427
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,954
Big advance for Naviti.

428
00:21:53,204 --> 00:21:55,123
That's good, Chels, keep going!

429
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,348
Chelsea is back. 
Course !

430
00:21:57,473 --> 00:21:59,494
She has time to catch up.

431
00:22:00,484 --> 00:22:03,298
Domenick and James 
are still looking for the combination.

432
00:22:03,435 --> 00:22:06,846
They failed to capitalize 
on their big lead.

433
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,645
Kellyn and Bradley 
try to catch up with them.

434
00:22:10,947 --> 00:22:13,445
Huge effort 
from both tribes so far.

435
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,345
Go on ! 
Domenick and James...

436
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,845
That's good for them! 
They can unlock the puzzle.

437
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,854
Guys, it's "Ghost island".

438
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,456
The Naviti have the key, 
you have to open the padlock.

439
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:32,547
They can attack the puzzle.

440
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,509
Well, what...? 
36, 27, 18.

441
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,945
Pull out the handle! 
Hey, take it out!

442
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,445
Kellyn and Bradley 
found the combination.

443
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:45,245
It would be a hell of a comeback 
for Malolo.

444
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,967
Slide the three! 
Go on !

445
00:22:47,092 --> 00:22:50,045
After a big setback 
on the bodyboard.

446
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,245
[???] 
Yes. Yes. Yes.

447
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,284
They can attack the puzzle.

448
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,245
Again there is a tie.

449
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,564
Bradley et Kellyn, James et Domenick,

450
00:22:59,689 --> 00:23:01,445
side by side, for immunity.

451
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,845
At the very end ! 
Bring back the "N"!

452
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,953
These sliding puzzles are known

453
00:23:06,078 --> 00:23:08,145
to pretend 
we're almost there.

454
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,986
Any Survivor fan knows,

455
00:23:10,148 --> 00:23:13,245
a puzzle is not finished 
until the last piece is placed.

456
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:14,469
Yeah, come on!

457
00:23:14,631 --> 00:23:17,292
Bring it back! 
Bring them back, calm down!

458
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,892
The "H" is missing!

459
00:23:19,057 --> 00:23:20,845
Bradley and Kellyn don't panic.

460
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,945
It goes all the way! 
So !

461
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,645
They progress 
slowly and methodically.

462
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,245
Keep it open! 
Keep the "O" at the top!

463
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:32,245
The "A" at the top, to bring the "D" back!

464
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,945
Energy at Naviti.

465
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,302
Its good !

466
00:23:35,473 --> 00:23:37,492
Domenick seems to have the chat.

467
00:23:37,742 --> 00:23:40,528
He barks orders, 
but James thinks he knows better.

468
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,170
Yeah yeah !

469
00:23:42,447 --> 00:23:44,745
Raise the "I". Good, good.

470
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,845
Bradley and Kellyn are making progress.

471
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,340
It takes one of the "S".

472
00:23:49,487 --> 00:23:51,445
Keep doing what you're doing!

473
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,374
Bring... Yes, to the "N"!

474
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,545
The Navitis are on full throttle.

475
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,745
They seem close.

476
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,170
So ! Close it!

477
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,299
They think it's good.

478
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,145
It's the case !

479
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,445
Naviti wins immunity!

480
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:11,245
They send Malolo back to the council.

481
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:13,628
We did it ! 
We did the puzzle!

482
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,470
We did the puzzle! 
We did the puzzle!

483
00:24:23,821 --> 00:24:26,574
Naviti, once again, 
immunity is yours.

484
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,043
Thanks, Jeff.

485
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,745
Naviti, no advice tonight.

486
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:37,246
No one will leave your tribe. 
Take your things, leave.

487
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,179
Kelly's.

488
00:24:45,304 --> 00:24:48,229
We can say 
that you are expressive.

489
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:50,845
We guess your feelings 
by looking at you.

490
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,445
You lower your head 
from the moment of defeat.

491
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:58,573
Yes, Jeff. I feel 
like I let everyone down.

492
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,942
I wish I had succeeded.

493
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:04,245
We didn't want to 
go back to the board.

494
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,770
But this is Survivor.

495
00:25:07,532 --> 00:25:11,853
And yet, Michael, even if 
Naviti assume defeat,

496
00:25:11,995 --> 00:25:14,770
let's be clear: 
will it be a Malolo tonight?

497
00:25:15,006 --> 00:25:18,370
Is it Stephanie, Jenna and you 
who are threatened?

498
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:21,545
Yes. There is little hope 
for us.

499
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:24,101
I want us to stay 
as strong as possible,

500
00:25:24,248 --> 00:25:25,684
But the reality

501
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:28,970
is that only two of us 
will return from the council.

502
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:31,586
We're gonna have to 
figure out what to do today.

503
00:25:31,756 --> 00:25:34,170
Take your things, leave. 
See you tonight at the council,

504
00:25:34,295 --> 00:25:37,870
where someone will be the 5th person 
eliminated from Survivor Ghost Island.

505
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:41,845
Having lost this immunity,

506
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:45,345
I was very disappointed 
not to have been able to make the team win.

507
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:49,345
But unless the ex-Malolo 
pull a trick out of their hat,

508
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,245
as in the last advice,

509
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:54,137
it's Stephanie, Michael or Jenna 
who will leave.

510
00:26:13,288 --> 00:26:15,987
I hate losing. 
Me too.

511
00:26:16,133 --> 00:26:18,243
It will be worse each time. 
Yes.

512
00:26:19,043 --> 00:26:21,718
To have lost that immunity 
is overwhelming.

513
00:26:21,843 --> 00:26:24,118
I am cornered.

514
00:26:24,243 --> 00:26:28,433
I am one of the three 
who are at risk of leaving.

515
00:26:28,584 --> 00:26:32,918
So I think it's accepted 
that it's every man for himself.

516
00:26:33,043 --> 00:26:35,418
I don't want to 
see Steph or Jenna leave,

517
00:26:35,543 --> 00:26:38,643
but I'm ready 
to vote for one of them tonight.

518
00:26:41,543 --> 00:26:44,643
I was thinking of Jenna. 
I would like to separate the two girls.

519
00:26:44,832 --> 00:26:48,643
For me, 
Jenna is one of the weakest here.

520
00:26:49,082 --> 00:26:52,990
Whatever you decide, I will follow, 
but it would be my choice.

521
00:26:53,143 --> 00:26:54,843
The argument is good.

522
00:26:57,743 --> 00:26:59,443
Going to counseling is going to be...

523
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:01,465
Depressing.

524
00:27:02,443 --> 00:27:05,443
There is no doubt 
that the five control the game.

525
00:27:05,743 --> 00:27:08,318
They won't budge, 
they're playing it safe.

526
00:27:08,443 --> 00:27:11,018
So the game is 100% individual 
at this stage.

527
00:27:11,143 --> 00:27:13,850
I think 
about the best strategy for me.

528
00:27:15,043 --> 00:27:18,643
In this game, 
you have to be sympathetic, appreciated.

529
00:27:19,043 --> 00:27:21,619
I do my best, but...

530
00:27:21,943 --> 00:27:27,343
Alas, I still have this absent, 
almost angry look.

531
00:27:27,468 --> 00:27:30,118
I find it difficult to leave 
this defensive and aggressive air.

532
00:27:30,243 --> 00:27:31,643
I am like this.

533
00:27:33,836 --> 00:27:35,481
Does your hair still smell good?

534
00:27:35,606 --> 00:27:37,268
Very vaguely.

535
00:27:37,518 --> 00:27:38,443
Feel that!

536
00:27:43,143 --> 00:27:44,495
A dead weasel!

537
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,618
I want to try 
to sympathize with Sebastian.

538
00:27:48,743 --> 00:27:51,443
I'll put my little wall aside

539
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:53,818
and hope 
that Sebastian will protect me.

540
00:27:53,943 --> 00:27:55,318
I make you braids?

541
00:27:55,443 --> 00:27:57,318
You said you didn't know.

542
00:27:57,443 --> 00:27:59,021
I never said that.

543
00:27:59,146 --> 00:28:02,143
I do sick braids.

544
00:28:03,543 --> 00:28:04,518
Bullshit!

545
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:05,695
You will see.

546
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,367
Jenna is in danger. 
And I need a braider.

547
00:28:09,543 --> 00:28:12,383
Otherwise, 
I will only have a giant braid

548
00:28:12,508 --> 00:28:14,418
instead of a small one.

549
00:28:14,543 --> 00:28:16,718
So, as long as she's flirting 
with me...

550
00:28:17,843 --> 00:28:21,343
... It's cool, and I want 
her to stay in the game.

551
00:28:27,213 --> 00:28:30,313
What worries me more 
about Stephanie than about Jenna,

552
00:28:30,438 --> 00:28:33,397
is that Stephanie 
is super strategic.

553
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:36,961
She's in the game. 
Jenna, not really.

554
00:28:37,211 --> 00:28:38,696
I agree.

555
00:28:38,946 --> 00:28:41,428
But... As you feel it.

556
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,434
For me, it must be Steph.

557
00:28:43,684 --> 00:28:47,405
Everyone changed their mind. 
They think we should vote out Stephanie.

558
00:28:47,655 --> 00:28:49,680
I don't know what to think about it...

559
00:28:49,975 --> 00:28:51,004
Most...

560
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,764
If everyone 
wants Stephanie, I am.

561
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:58,818
I know I'm a little freaked out, 
but...

562
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:01,118
If you keep me, use me!

563
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,006
I know how to count, I know where I am.

564
00:29:03,131 --> 00:29:04,822
No, I appreciate it, but... 
If you...

565
00:29:04,947 --> 00:29:07,091
I will see. 
... do something...

566
00:29:07,216 --> 00:29:11,158
But really. Because I would 
really like to work with you. So...

567
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:13,577
I won't attack you 
on the board, I promise!

568
00:29:13,702 --> 00:29:17,614
Sorry ! 
It's someone else's turn.

569
00:29:17,739 --> 00:29:19,995
With Bradley, I have to cook,

570
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,655
smile and blink,

571
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,527
because getting to the end 
is all that matters to me.

572
00:29:25,652 --> 00:29:27,712
I have two dependent children.

573
00:29:27,962 --> 00:29:31,425
I imagine receiving the million 
at the Reunion

574
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:34,227
and run to join my children,

575
00:29:34,352 --> 00:29:37,327
then scream because mom 
just won Survivor.

576
00:29:37,452 --> 00:29:40,636
It makes me hallucinate 
to think of this moment,

577
00:29:40,761 --> 00:29:43,261
because I'm only 25 days away,

578
00:29:43,511 --> 00:29:46,777
and I'm so close, 
and I want it so badly, for all of us...

579
00:29:47,947 --> 00:29:50,602
I have to keep my head in the game.

580
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:55,199
For me...Michael.

581
00:29:55,324 --> 00:29:57,462
You can't trust him at all.

582
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,029
No, he's smart.

583
00:29:59,425 --> 00:30:01,179
Nor to Stephanie.

584
00:30:01,304 --> 00:30:03,089
But Jenna is harmless

585
00:30:03,214 --> 00:30:05,062
and will do as Sebastian says.

586
00:30:05,187 --> 00:30:06,700
So go for Michael.

587
00:30:06,825 --> 00:30:09,226
Me too. 
Yes, finally, we...

588
00:30:13,001 --> 00:30:14,852
I am defenseless tonight.

589
00:30:14,977 --> 00:30:16,951
You want me out, I'm out.

590
00:30:17,076 --> 00:30:19,048
If you want to keep me...

591
00:30:19,173 --> 00:30:21,235
...which would make more sense...

592
00:30:22,182 --> 00:30:24,942
We can't keep losing. 
True.

593
00:30:25,258 --> 00:30:27,936
Even if you just keep me 
for the trials...

594
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:30,901
If I haven't proven my loyalty, 
get me out!

595
00:30:31,026 --> 00:30:32,843
But I will prove it.

596
00:30:32,968 --> 00:30:35,170
And win races. 
So it's...

597
00:30:35,673 --> 00:30:37,040
Winner winner.

598
00:30:37,818 --> 00:30:39,409
I think so. 
Yeah.

599
00:30:39,534 --> 00:30:41,748
You understand, I have the impression

600
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:44,181
to have to sell myself. 
Yes, I follow you.

601
00:30:45,742 --> 00:30:47,925
Because I promise, my loyalty is yours.

602
00:30:50,923 --> 00:30:54,780
I do my best to cut 
corners, especially with Bradley,

603
00:30:54,905 --> 00:30:57,916
but you never really know 
what people think.

604
00:30:58,041 --> 00:30:59,970
I may not have a chance.

605
00:31:00,095 --> 00:31:02,770
I gave the best of myself.

606
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:05,684
I'm playing the game I've been waiting 
to play for 10 years.

607
00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:09,883
If I didn't give my all, 
I would never forgive myself.

608
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:15,334
I'm only 18.

609
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:19,451
This game is the best experience 
of my life so far.

610
00:31:19,576 --> 00:31:22,983
And the fact that my options 
seem limited,

611
00:31:23,108 --> 00:31:24,802
it's hard, it's frustrating.

612
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:28,107
I have always been independent.

613
00:31:28,985 --> 00:31:32,025
Someone 
who wanted more for himself.

614
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,572
Getting away from my family 
at a young age

615
00:31:34,822 --> 00:31:38,834
to come and play this crazy game, 
for me, it's...

616
00:31:38,959 --> 00:31:42,179
I want to accomplish things 
as young as possible and...

617
00:31:42,751 --> 00:31:44,448
I really want it.

618
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:51,323
We have a few minutes, 
we have to decide quickly.

619
00:31:52,335 --> 00:31:54,010
It's who we want.

620
00:31:54,608 --> 00:31:56,667
Voting Stephanie is the riskiest.

621
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:59,006
She may have brought something back 
from Ghost Island.

622
00:31:59,146 --> 00:32:00,631
So who, Michael?

623
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,936
I don't know what happened 
to Stephanie on Ghost Island.

624
00:32:06,186 --> 00:32:08,654
and so what she might have.

625
00:32:10,543 --> 00:32:12,180
There is nothing here.

626
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,294
But I'm starting to think to myself 
that nothing happened to him,

627
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:18,349
because I searched his bag 
and there was nothing.

628
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:20,816
I don't know where she could have put it,

629
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:23,668
but she might have an advantage. 
I am not sure.

630
00:32:23,804 --> 00:32:25,202
Nothing.

631
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,099
Safe ? 
Yeah.

632
00:32:27,224 --> 00:32:29,293
As council approaches tonight,

633
00:32:29,463 --> 00:32:32,163
a hundred different variables 
go through your head.

634
00:32:32,413 --> 00:32:34,170
It is therefore necessary to assess

635
00:32:34,295 --> 00:32:38,381
who is the most trustworthy, 
who is the most dangerous,

636
00:32:38,506 --> 00:32:40,976
and which poses the least threat to 
my own game.

637
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,302
But fortunately, we have the majority.

638
00:32:44,427 --> 00:32:47,390
We have control and we lead the dance.

639
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,644
Kellyn. When we left the test,

640
00:33:23,894 --> 00:33:27,136
it seemed clear that it was 
Stephanie, Jenna or Michael

641
00:33:27,261 --> 00:33:30,050
who would leave tonight. 
Does it still feel?

642
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,388
Yes, the afternoon was busy.

643
00:33:32,513 --> 00:33:36,155
Say we all agreed 
all day on who to hang out with

644
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,574
would be lying.

645
00:33:37,699 --> 00:33:40,483
To me, 
that's the beauty of Survivor.

646
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:44,565
And it is also very painful 
for the person who is going to leave.

647
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:47,173
Because a single sentence 
said by one of us

648
00:33:47,298 --> 00:33:49,670
it pu enough to change 
collective opinion.

649
00:33:49,835 --> 00:33:52,155
And that will make all the difference 
tonight.

650
00:33:52,738 --> 00:33:55,381
I look at the three faces 
that hear that.

651
00:33:55,506 --> 00:33:58,479
Stephanie. A sentence, 
a comment,

652
00:33:58,729 --> 00:34:00,214
can make the difference.

653
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:03,541
We feel a little helpless. 
I was on Ghost Island.

654
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:06,618
It scares me: what did I miss 
during my absence?

655
00:34:06,743 --> 00:34:10,828
A lot can happen overnight, 
when you're away from your tribe.

656
00:34:10,953 --> 00:34:14,609
Bradley. Were there concerns 
that Stephanie's stay on the island

657
00:34:14,734 --> 00:34:17,364
could affect 
this vote?

658
00:34:17,614 --> 00:34:20,301
Sure. It would be silly 
not to worry.

659
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,624
Has she played the game? 
Didn't she play it?

660
00:34:23,749 --> 00:34:27,111
I do not know. 
But we have to approach this vote

661
00:34:27,236 --> 00:34:29,114
as if she had an advantage.

662
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:31,872
So is it helping you, Stephanie, 
or is it hurting you,

663
00:34:31,997 --> 00:34:33,814
this potential benefit?

664
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:37,284
It can have both results, 
depending on the nature of the advantage,

665
00:34:37,441 --> 00:34:39,405
if I play it. Lots of "ifs".

666
00:34:40,014 --> 00:34:43,043
Sebastian. What is particularly hard, 
in Survivor,

667
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:45,967
we don't know 
what the truth is

668
00:34:46,092 --> 00:34:48,128
before it is finally revealed.

669
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:52,138
Yes, we cannot be sure of anything. 
We learned that at the last council.

670
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:54,875
But that's pretty simple, Jeff.

671
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,647
We need to take out the three 
who aren't our allies.

672
00:34:57,772 --> 00:34:59,460
Can I intervene? 
Yes.

673
00:34:59,585 --> 00:35:02,042
I think when the merger comes,

674
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,146
you have to have the majority

675
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:08,232
For that, we must 
win the next events.

676
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:11,489
I'm your best card 
to earn them

677
00:35:11,614 --> 00:35:13,922
and achieve majority merger.

678
00:35:14,047 --> 00:35:16,589
Kellyn. What Michael points out, 
it seems to me,

679
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:19,704
is that if you only want 
to win the five against three,

680
00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:20,794
it is done.

681
00:35:21,044 --> 00:35:22,889
But if you want to go all the way

682
00:35:23,014 --> 00:35:24,815
and keep coming out of the strong,

683
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,551
is this the trick to play 
for a clever quintet?

684
00:35:27,824 --> 00:35:31,355
It seems that we are 
on a bad slope,

685
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,226
in terms of tests,

686
00:35:33,351 --> 00:35:36,003
but there are so many ways 
to consider

687
00:35:36,128 --> 00:35:38,658
what is strength in this game...

688
00:35:38,783 --> 00:35:41,615
Bradley. Kellyn says the force 
has many faces.

689
00:35:41,865 --> 00:35:43,548
Michael clearly showed

690
00:35:43,673 --> 00:35:46,285
strategic skills 
at the last council.

691
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,429
That must have alarmed you a bit.

692
00:35:48,554 --> 00:35:49,786
Absolutely.

693
00:35:49,911 --> 00:35:51,766
Coming to the last tip,

694
00:35:51,891 --> 00:35:54,061
I didn't think I was in danger.

695
00:35:54,311 --> 00:35:56,830
And for a moment, 
I thought I was leaving.

696
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,707
So that's a valid argument.

697
00:35:58,832 --> 00:36:02,299
to say that after what he did 
to this council, especially to me,

698
00:36:02,424 --> 00:36:06,353
I would like above all to eliminate it, 
immediately.

699
00:36:06,478 --> 00:36:10,110
Listen. My alliance with Jenna, 
Steph and Brendan was real

700
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:12,121
and I did my best,

701
00:36:12,246 --> 00:36:15,321
using my idol, 
lying a little along the way,

702
00:36:15,446 --> 00:36:18,223
to get my wedding ring 
where we needed to go.

703
00:36:18,348 --> 00:36:20,015
Now I have to change,

704
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,132
but I intend to show you

705
00:36:22,257 --> 00:36:25,343
the same respect I showed 
my original allies.

706
00:36:26,046 --> 00:36:28,724
Stephanie. 
If it's one of you three,

707
00:36:28,849 --> 00:36:31,521
what is the meaning 
of this journey in Survivor?

708
00:36:31,646 --> 00:36:33,834
Why do you have to stay?

709
00:36:36,712 --> 00:36:38,394
I want to be here because...

710
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:40,791
It's my dream, and I...

711
00:36:41,888 --> 00:36:44,718
... Wanted to experience this 
for so many years.

712
00:36:44,843 --> 00:36:47,513
And every time 
I come to the council,

713
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,981
either quite often, 
which is frustrating,

714
00:36:50,106 --> 00:36:53,456
it's harder, because I'm 
on the brink of seeing it disappear.

715
00:36:53,603 --> 00:36:55,422
And I want to keep having

716
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:58,392
opportunities to grow in this game, 
personally,

717
00:36:58,642 --> 00:37:01,745
and live all the experiences 
that I've watched

718
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,187
all these years.

719
00:37:03,312 --> 00:37:07,000
And if this is the end, 
what will remain unfulfilled?

720
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:10,568
This question touches me 
deeply because...

721
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:12,049
For me, I...

722
00:37:12,174 --> 00:37:14,208
I play for my children, and...

723
00:37:14,794 --> 00:37:18,584
It's my game, my moment, 
but they're so close to my heart...

724
00:37:19,216 --> 00:37:22,816
They're the only ones I'm afraid 
of disappointing in life.

725
00:37:23,391 --> 00:37:25,204
I am not ready to leave.

726
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:29,223
I truly believe 
that some of the bonds I've made,

727
00:37:29,473 --> 00:37:32,359
with Malolo and Naviti, 
are very real.

728
00:37:32,536 --> 00:37:35,929
The game is still long and I still have a 
lot of game in me.

729
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,407
Jenna. And for you ?

730
00:37:38,532 --> 00:37:41,101
What drew you 
to Survivor?

731
00:37:41,226 --> 00:37:43,378
Me, I always had this barrier,

732
00:37:43,503 --> 00:37:46,992
that face that says, "I don't want to 
be approached, to be vulnerable."

733
00:37:47,117 --> 00:37:48,543
I open little.

734
00:37:48,668 --> 00:37:51,178
When I know 
they're going to have to eliminate me,

735
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,915
I always have that in mind.

736
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:56,049
It's hard, because I want to make 
ties, I do my best.

737
00:37:56,204 --> 00:38:00,408
I have work to do, this game will push me 
to come out of my shell more.

738
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,562
For the rest, I hope not to 
be in the category

739
00:38:03,687 --> 00:38:05,845
what they want to 
eliminate tonight.

740
00:38:06,497 --> 00:38:09,469
Sebastian. 
If we forget purple and orange

741
00:38:09,594 --> 00:38:11,632
and we just listen to Jenna talk,

742
00:38:11,882 --> 00:38:13,934
she is here to improve

743
00:38:14,184 --> 00:38:15,592
on the social plan,

744
00:38:15,717 --> 00:38:17,539
and she chooses the social game

745
00:38:17,664 --> 00:38:20,041
hardest ever invented 
to do it!

746
00:38:20,166 --> 00:38:23,644
That must make it a bit difficult 
to write his name.

747
00:38:23,894 --> 00:38:25,451
Sure.

748
00:38:25,576 --> 00:38:28,615
It kills me to write any name 
in this game, it sucks.

749
00:38:28,865 --> 00:38:31,951
I realize his experience, 
I understand very well.

750
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:34,515
But there are 
multiple angles for everything.

751
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,551
Michael. 
What does Survivor mean to you?

752
00:38:37,676 --> 00:38:39,819
I've been a fan all my life.

753
00:38:39,944 --> 00:38:42,351
I've been following the show 
since I was 13.

754
00:38:42,476 --> 00:38:46,451
Coming, everyone imagines 
their perfect game, sees themselves at the end.

755
00:38:46,576 --> 00:38:50,976
It's very hard for my game not to 
run as expected.

756
00:38:51,101 --> 00:38:55,651
But I think I was able to show 
that I am authentic.

757
00:38:55,776 --> 00:38:57,751
I play my best.

758
00:38:57,876 --> 00:39:01,276
I strive to be loyal to everyone 
and to go far.

759
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:04,618
Desiree. 
Was there a clear objective,

760
00:39:04,758 --> 00:39:06,351
among the five Naviti,

761
00:39:06,476 --> 00:39:09,656
on whom to eliminate, and why?

762
00:39:09,804 --> 00:39:13,551
Clearly. There's always a good 
reason to eliminate someone.

763
00:39:13,676 --> 00:39:15,551
Just find it.

764
00:39:15,676 --> 00:39:18,124
And I think tonight 
we found the reason

765
00:39:18,249 --> 00:39:19,773
to take out one of the three.

766
00:39:19,898 --> 00:39:21,138
A good reason.

767
00:39:21,376 --> 00:39:23,176
The future will show it.

768
00:39:26,476 --> 00:39:28,558
Good. It's time to vote.

769
00:39:28,683 --> 00:39:30,176
Chelsea, over.

770
00:40:02,626 --> 00:40:04,104
I will count the votes.

771
00:40:13,376 --> 00:40:15,750
If anyone has an immunity idol 
and wants to play it,

772
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:17,641
now is the time to do it.

773
00:40:23,413 --> 00:40:25,651
Good. Once the votes have been read, 
the decision is final.

774
00:40:25,776 --> 00:40:28,251
The eliminated person 
will leave the council immediately.

775
00:40:28,376 --> 00:40:29,729
I will read the votes.

776
00:40:47,176 --> 00:40:49,076
Steph. 
Two votes Stephanie.

777
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:55,176
Stephanie. 
Three votes Stephanie.

778
00:41:01,076 --> 00:41:03,292
Four Stephanie votes, 
one Desiree vote.

779
00:41:05,376 --> 00:41:07,151
Fifth person eliminated 
from Survivor:

780
00:41:07,276 --> 00:41:10,043
Stephanie. Five is enough. 
Bring me your torch.

781
00:41:21,976 --> 00:41:23,731
Stephanie, the tribe has spoken.

782
00:41:28,776 --> 00:41:30,002
It's time to go.

783
00:41:30,127 --> 00:41:31,133
Goodbye !

784
00:41:41,776 --> 00:41:45,512
The five Naviti continue 
to win as an alliance

785
00:41:45,676 --> 00:41:47,251
and to lose as a tribe.

786
00:41:47,376 --> 00:41:48,749
Something has to change.

787
00:41:48,874 --> 00:41:51,123
Take your torches, 
return to your camp. Good night.

788
00:42:05,973 --> 00:42:08,970
Stay with us, to see 
a preview of the next episode.

789
00:42:12,158 --> 00:42:14,573
Next time in Survivor...

790
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,428
The demarcations are established.

791
00:42:16,553 --> 00:42:18,928
Domenick and Chris 
each want to kill the other.

792
00:42:19,071 --> 00:42:20,628
The targets are clear.

793
00:42:20,753 --> 00:42:22,828
I'm afraid I'll be next.

794
00:42:22,953 --> 00:42:24,292
But a bomb explodes.

795
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:25,839
Throw away your bandanas!

796
00:42:26,153 --> 00:42:29,028
A brand new start 
in Survivor Ghost Island.

797
00:42:29,287 --> 00:42:32,053
Why, Jeff? Why do that ?

798
00:42:32,284 --> 00:42:34,828
I waited 36 seasons 
to be able to play.

799
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:37,828
Leaving fifth, 
without having the full experience,

800
00:42:37,953 --> 00:42:39,528
it breaks my heart.

801
00:42:39,653 --> 00:42:41,728
But I played my best.

802
00:42:41,853 --> 00:42:43,628
I played hard and...

803
00:42:43,753 --> 00:42:45,428
I still believe in myself.

804
00:42:45,553 --> 00:42:49,268
At the end of the day, I go back 
to the family that I know.

805
00:42:49,953 --> 00:42:51,881
They will be proud of me.
