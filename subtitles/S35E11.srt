1
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,130
>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON
"SURVIVOR," BEN FOUND AN IDOL

2
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:09,259
AND WAS PLAYING DOUBLE AGENT.

3
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,720
>> I GOT TO GET ASHLEY OUT.

4
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,263
>> MY MISSION IS TO STAY ON THE
INSIDE OF CHRISSY AND RYAN.

5
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:16,808
>> Jeff: WHILE HIS TRUE
ALLEGIANCE WAS TO A CORE FOUR.

6
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,601
>> WE DON'T NEED JOE.

7
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,519
DONE DEAL.

8
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:21,271
>> Jeff: BUT THEY SAW BEN AS
MAJOR THREAT.

9
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,314
>> I AM CONSIDERING GETTING BEN
OUT.

10
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:28,278
>> THIS IS A DIFFICULT DECISION.

11
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:31,448
>> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
RYAN PLAYED HIS IDOL.

12
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,615
>> IT'S FOR ME.

13
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,118
>> Jeff: BUT THE CORE FOUR
STUCK TOGETHER.

14
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,287
11th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE FOURTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

15
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,124
>> Jeff: STUNNING RYAN,
CHRISSY, AND MIKE.

16
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:45,295
JOE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

17
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,172
SEVEN ARE LEFT.

18
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,299
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

19
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:10,278
>> NICE JOB, GUYS.

20
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,446
AGAIN, COMPLETELY IN THE DARK.

21
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,323
AGAIN I GOT BLIND SIDED.

22
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,951
I JUST BELIEVE PEOPLE WHEN THEY
TELL ME SOMETHING, AND EACH AND

23
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,329
EVERY TIME I GET SCREWED.

24
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,706
I'M GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS.

25
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,041
I JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW.

26
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,210
>> GOOD MOVE, THOUGH, GUYS.

27
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,337
>> I WAS FRICKING HOODWINKED.

28
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,338
I WAS JUST DUPED.

29
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,340
APPARENTLY BEN WAS WITH DEVON,
LAUREN, AND ASHLEY.

30
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,342
I HAD NO IDEA.

31
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,636
AND I PLAYED MY IDOL.

32
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,804
I DIDN'T HAVE TO.

33
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:36,971
THEY FLUSHED THAT.

34
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,014
I'M IN AN AWFUL SPOT RIGHT NOW.

35
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:41,351
I HAVE NO ALLIES EXCEPT CHRISSY,
WHO HAS NO POWER.

36
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:45,188
BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT WENT
REALLY WELL.

37
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,524
>> SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT
HAPPENED TONIGHT?

38
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,485
>> YEAH, JOE WENT HOME.

39
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:53,363
MY PLAN DIDN'T LINE UP WITH YOUR
GUYS' PLAN.

40
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,699
AND I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU
GUYS... YEAH, RIGHT.

41
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,869
>> I HAD YOUR BACK SINCE DAY
ONE.

42
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,748
WHAT YOU DID TODAY REALLY SHOWED
YOUR TRUE COLORS.

43
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:07,752
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, LISTEN TO ME,
ANYBODY WHO GOES AGAINST YOU,

44
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,380
CHRISSY, IS ALL OF A SUDDEN THE
BAD MAN.

45
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,382
>> OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE SUCH A
JERK, BEN.

46
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,259
I SERIOUSLY NEVER EXPECTED...

47
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:15,385
>> YOU CAN'T MOTHER ME, CHRISSY.

48
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,386
>> WHY AM I MOTHERING YOU?

49
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,721
I DON'T CALL MY KIDS A JERK.

50
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,182
>> WHEN ANYBODY GOES AGAINST
YOU, YOU START DOING THIS.

51
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:21,891
>> DOING WHAT?

52
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,560
>> IT'S A GAME OF "SURVIVOR."

53
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,228
>> OKAY, GOOD NIGHT.

54
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,521
>> NIGHT, NIGHT.

55
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,439
>> I GET THE FACT THAT THIS IS A
GAME.

56
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:32,360
BUT I FELT VERY CLOSE TO BEN,
AND HIS RESPONSE WAS INHUMAN.

57
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,404
AND HE WASN'T EVEN A FRIEND
ABOUT IT.

58
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,406
HE WAS JUST KIND OF BEING A
JERK.

59
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,284
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING
TO DO.

60
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,912
>> IT LOOKS LIKE MY DAYS ARE
NUMBERED, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO

61
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,080
ROLL OVER AND DIE.

62
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:46,583
I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO
MAKE IT TO THE END FOR MY

63
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,750
FAMILY.

64
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,919
AND IF I GET A CHANCE TO GET
BACK AT BEN, I'M GOING TO TAKE

65
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:57,385
IT.

66
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:09,147
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

67
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,189
ALL RIGHT.

68
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,650
YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S
REWARD CHALLENGE?

69
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,776
>> YEAH.

70
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,486
>> Jeff: IT IS ANOTHER NEW
"SURVIVOR" CHALLENGE, AND YOU

71
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,447
WILL BE RUNNING IN PAIRS.

72
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,281
>> OH, WOW.

73
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,576
>> Jeff: BUT NOT WITH EACH
OTHER.

74
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,368
WITH YOUR LOVED ONES.

75
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,495
>> YES!

76
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,582
>> Jeff: ASHLEY, LET'S GET YOU
SOME LOVE.

77
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,876
HERE'S YOUR DAD, JIM.

78
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:30,960
COME ON OUT, JIM.

79
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,589
>> POPS!

80
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,758
>> I LOVE YOU.

81
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,426
>> OH, MY GOD.

82
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,803
>> I TALK A LOT ABOUT YOU.

83
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:41,971
>> YOU LOOK AWESOME.

84
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,849
>> Jeff: ASHLEY, ONE THING
THAT ALWAYS STRIKES ME IS THE

85
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,352
WAY A DAUGHTER FALLS INTO THE
ARMS OF HER DAD.

86
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:50,647
IT'S LIKE NO OTHER SAFE SPOT IN
THE WORLD.

87
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,815
WHAT IS THAT FOR YOU RIGHT NOW?

88
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,360
>> IT'S EVERYTHING.

89
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,154
I'VE ALREADY TOLD EVERY SINGLE
PERSON BEHIND ME THAT HE'S THE

90
00:03:58,237 --> 00:03:58,613
BEST MAN I'VE EVER KNOWN.

91
00:03:58,696 --> 00:03:59,822
>> Jeff: REALLY?

92
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,868
>> HE'S TAKEN CARE OF US AT THE
HARDEST TIMES OF OUR LIVES.

93
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,079
HE TAKES CARE OF EVERYONE BEFORE
HE DOES HIMSELF.

94
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:09,999
>> Jeff: JIM, SO THIS REALLY
IS A FATHER-DAUGHTER CONNECTION?

95
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,626
>> OH, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

96
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,504
SHE'S SO INDEPENDENT AND STRONG
AND I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD.

97
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,506
>> Jeff: GIVE HIM LAST
SUGGEST.

98
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:22,011
>> I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

99
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:22,679
>> I LOVE YOU.

100
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,930
>> LOVE YOU.

101
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:24,764
>> OH, MY GOD.

102
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,100
>> Jeff: RYAN, WHO DO YOU WANT
TO SEE?

103
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,518
>> MY DAD.

104
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,353
>> Jeff: LET'S GET YOU DAD OUT
HERE.

105
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:41,364
STEVE, COME ON OUT.

106
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:46,035
>> I TOLD YOU I'D GET YOU HERE,
RIGHT?

107
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,329
YOU GOOD?

108
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:48,913
YEAH?

109
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,248
>> Jeff: RYAN, TALK TO ME?

110
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,332
WHY YOUR DAD.

111
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,002
WHY IS THIS THE PERSON YOU
WANTED TO COME VISIT YOU?

112
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,337
>> WE WATCH THE SHOW TOGETHER.

113
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,422
WE'D DISSECT THE EPISODE.

114
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:01,592
I TOLD HIM WE COULD HAVE THIS
MOMENT TOGETHER, AND IT

115
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:01,884
HAPPENED.

116
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,553
I KNOW.

117
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,263
IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.

118
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,015
THIS IS MY DREAM.

119
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:11,519
SHARING THIS MOMENT WITH MY DAD
IS... IT'S THE BEST MOMENT OF MY

120
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,270
LIFE.

121
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,230
>> Jeff: GIVE HIM A LAST HUG,
DAD.

122
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:15,023
>> I LOVE YOU.

123
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,609
>> LOVE YOU, BUDDY.

124
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:23,406
>> Jeff: MIKE, EVERYBODY IS
WONDERING WHO MARRIED YOU.

125
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,742
LET'S MEET YOUR WIFE.

126
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:30,747
MARY, COME ON OUT.

127
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,874
>> MARY.

128
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:42,091
>> I LOVE YOU.

129
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,885
>> OH, WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT
YOU.

130
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,429
>> GOD BLESS YOU, IS ALL I HAVE
TO SAY.

131
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,264
BUT HE'S A GOOD GUY.

132
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:48,765
>> HE IS.

133
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,640
HE IS.

134
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,101
>> Jeff: WHAT DOES THAT FEEL
LIKE, MIKE?

135
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:56,064
AFTER 31 DAYS TO, HAVE THE WOMAN
YOU CHOSE NEXT TO YOU, WHAT ARE

136
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,565
YOU FEELING?

137
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,567
>> I MEAN, COMING OUT HERE I
THINK I ALWAYS KNEW THAT OUR

138
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,695
LOVE WAS SPECIAL, BUT NOW I
REALLY THINK IT'S ONE OF THE

139
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,616
GREATEST LOVES OF ALL TIME.

140
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,787
AND, I MEAN, THIS IS<i> THE</i> MOST
SELFISH THING I EVER DID, SAYING

141
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,497
I'M PACKING UP FOR WEEKS AND
GOING ON "SURVIVOR."

142
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,626
>> IT'S THE ONLY SELFISH THING
HE'S EVER DONE.

143
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,337
HE'S NEVER DONE ANYTHING FOR
HIMSELF EVER.

144
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,090
>> AND SHE LET ME LIVE MY DREAM.

145
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,134
>> Jeff: GIVE HER A LAST HUG.

146
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,260
>> LOVE YOU.

147
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,638
>> Jeff: LAUREN, LET'S GET
YOUR SISTER OUT HERE.

148
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:29,639
SONNY, COME ON OUT.

149
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:35,603
LAUREN NEEDS SOME LOVE.

150
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:39,774
>> WHAT?

151
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:40,650
>> Jeff: WOW.

152
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,360
35 SEASONS I GET A HUG.

153
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,487
>> I STILL LOVE YOU.

154
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:50,785
I MISSED YOU, TOO.

155
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:51,994
>> Jeff: YOU GUYS ARE CLEARLY
SISTERS.

156
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,498
NO OTHER WOMAN WOULD COME OUT
AND GRAB HER SISTER'S STOMACH

157
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,875
AND SAY, HEY, LOSING SOME
WEIGHT.

158
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,629
>> WE'RE LIKE NIGHT AND DAY.

159
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,089
WE HAVE THE SAME DAD.

160
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:06,134
WE GREW UP IN TWO DIFFERENT
HOUSEHOLD, BUT I'M ACTUALLY

161
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,802
LIVING HER DREAM.

162
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:08,511
>> Jeff: HOW SO?

163
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,929
>> SHE'S A HUGE "SURVIVOR" FAN.

164
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:13,724
SHE BEGGED ME FOR TWO WEEKS THE
TRY OUT AT AN OPEN CASTING CALL.

165
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,853
WE WENT TOGETHER, AND I MADE IT
AND SHE DIDN'T, BUT THIS IS A

166
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:22,358
HUGE THING FOR HER, AND I FEEL
LIKE HER BEING HERE, IT WILL

167
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:26,863
MAKE US CLOSER AND WE CAN DEPEND
ON EACH OTHER MORE FROM HERE ON

168
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,363
OUT.

169
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:28,197
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

170
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,198
GIVE HER LAST HUG.

171
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,533
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN MARRIED?

172
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,743
>> ALMOST 20 YEARS.

173
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:33,536
>> Jeff: SHALL WE GET YOU
HUSBAND OUT HERE?

174
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,329
>> YES!

175
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:45,381
>> Jeff: KEITH, COME ON OUT.

176
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:52,346
>> Jeff: KEITH, COME ON OUT.

177
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:56,392
[[INAUDIBLE]
CHRISSY, WHAT IS THE FEELING

178
00:07:56,475 --> 00:08:00,021
RIGHT NOW, KNOWING THIS IS
SOMEBODY YOU KNOW YOU CAN TRUST?

179
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:04,734
>> WHEN YOU'RE OUT HERE FOR 31
DAYS, YOU JUST GET BROKEN.

180
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:08,571
WE'RE TIRED, WE'RE STARVING,
WE'RE DIRTY, AND THEN SOMEONE

181
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:12,700
COMES OUT WHO YOU KNOW YOU
JUST... HE'S MY EVERYTHING.

182
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,578
HE'S MY EVERYTHING.

183
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,705
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, ON THE RARE
MOMENTS WHEN YOU'RE ABLE TO NOT

184
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:20,750
THINK ABOUT THE GAME AND YOU'RE
ABLE TO TRY TO PUT YOUR LIFE

185
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,712
BACK HOME IN PERSPECTIVE, HAVE
YOU REEVALUATED YOUR LIFE AT

186
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:25,213
ALL?

187
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,799
>> YES, DEFINITELY.

188
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:32,136
THE LAST FEW YEARS I'VE JUST
GOTTEN SO CAUGHT UP IN WORK THAT

189
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,723
I THINK I'VE JUST TURNED AWAY
AND ALL I WANT TO DO WHEN I GET

190
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:41,270
HOME IS JUST DEVOTE THE REST OF
MY LIFE TO MY FAMILY, AND I HAVE

191
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,772
THE MOST INCREDIBLE FAMILY.

192
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:46,442
I MEAN, THIS IS THE MOST
INCREDIBLE MAN I'VE EVER KNOWN.

193
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:50,279
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, I DON'T
THINK I'VE SEEN YOU SMILE LIKE

194
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:50,780
THIS FOR 31 DAYS.

195
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:51,614
>> MAYBE YESTERDAY.

196
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,825
I WON IMMUNITY YESTERDAY.

197
00:08:54,909 --> 00:09:00,289
>> Jeff: AN WE'RE BACK TO THE
GAME.

198
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,123
[LAUGHTER]
ALL RIGHT.

199
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:06,921
GIVE HER A LAST GOOD-BYE.

200
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:10,466
>> Jeff: DEVON, WHO DO YOU
WANT TO SEE?

201
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:12,635
>> ME AND MY MOM, PLEASE.

202
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,135
>> Jeff: OKAY.

203
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,638
SONYA, COME ON OUT.

204
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:30,486
DEVON NEEDS SOME LOVE.

205
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:39,495
>> I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU.

206
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:46,002
>> YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

207
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,879
>> Jeff: THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL
TO WATCH.

208
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:53,676
IS IT POSSIBLE, DEVON, TO
EXPLAIN TO YOUR MOM WHAT IT'S

209
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,512
LIKE OUT HERE WHEN YOU DON'T
HAVE THAT FOUNDATION OF LOVE AND

210
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,389
TRUST AND SUPPORT?

211
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:03,853
>> IT JUST MAKES YOU REALIZE
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IN LIFE,

212
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:08,024
AND I JUST REALIZE THAT EVERY
DAY THAT I SPEND AWAY FROM YOU

213
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:13,195
AND THE FAMILY FEELS LIKE A DAY
WASTED.

214
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,363
REALLY.

215
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,907
>> IT'S A LUCKY DAY FOR WHOEVER
GETS TO BE WITH YOU, HONEY.

216
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:17,700
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

217
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:26,500
GIVE HIM A LAST HUG.

218
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:30,588
>> THAT A BOY, DEV.

219
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,548
>> Jeff: BEN, YOU READY THE
SEE YOU WIFE?

220
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:33,215
>> YES, SIR.

221
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:42,892
>> Jeff: KELLY, COME ON OUT.

222
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:46,729
>> YOU SMELL SO GOOD.

223
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:56,572
YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.

224
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:57,114
HOW ARE THE KIDS?

225
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,908
>> GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.

226
00:10:58,991 --> 00:10:59,909
EVERYBODY'S GOOD.

227
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,036
>> Jeff: BEN, I HEARD YOU ASK,
ARE THE KIDS GOOD?

228
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,120
IS THAT MOST WHAT'S ON YOUR
MIND?

229
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:08,376
>> HER, MY SEASON AND MY
DAUGHTER ARE WHY I'M OUT HERE,

230
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,835
BECAUSE I'M DOING THIS ALL FOR
THEM, YOU KNOW?

231
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,589
I'M THE RICHEST MAN EVER JUST
BECAUSE I HAVE THEM THREE.

232
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,760
YOU KNOW, COMING BACK AS A
VETERAN, YOU JUST GO TRUE A . OF

233
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,763
EMOTIONS AND DEPRESSION AND I
HAD ONE FOOT IN THE GAVE.

234
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,433
AND SHE PICKED ME UP AND GAVE ME
LIFE.

235
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,893
YOU KNOW, I'M HERE.

236
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,061
I'M ON THE EARTH BECAUSE OF HER.

237
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:30,272
>> DREW: KELLY, WHAT'S THIS
MOMENT LIKE FOR YOU, TO BE OUT

238
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:30,731
HERE?

239
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:31,941
>> OH, AMAZING.

240
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:32,817
AMAZING.

241
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,945
IT FEELS SO GOOD TO BE NEXT TO
HIM AGAIN.

242
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,615
WITHOUT HIM AROUND IT'S A BIG
HOLE IN OUR WORLD.

243
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:40,658
>> Jeff: HOW OLD ARE THE KIDS?

244
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,952
>> FIVE AND THREE.

245
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,662
>> Jeff: SO THEY'RE LITTLE.

246
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,998
>> THEY'RE REAL LITTLE, AND I'M
MISSIONING THEM A BUNCH.

247
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:48,499
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

248
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,084
GIVE HIM A LAST HUG.

249
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,085
>> I LOVE YOU.

250
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:55,965
>> Jeff: I LOVE YOU, HONEY.

251
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,633
[APPLAUSE]
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

252
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,468
WELL, A HUG IS NICE.

253
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,973
BUT YOU'VE COME THIS FAR, YOU
WANT THE FULL EXPERIENCE.

254
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:08,310
THE ONLY WAY THE GUARANTEE THAT
YOU GET QUALITY TIME WITH YOUR

255
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:14,066
LOVED ONES IS IF YOU ARE REALLY
IN SYNC WITH THEM.

256
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,527
YOU'RE EACH GOING TO HAVE BAG.

257
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,821
INSIDE THE BAG ARE TWO MARBLES,
ONE BLACK AND ONE WHITE.

258
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,449
YOU'RE EACH GOING TO DRAW A
MARBLE.

259
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,160
IF THEY MATCH, YOU STAY ALIVE.

260
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,744
IF THEY DON'T, YOU'RE OUT.

261
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:26,662
IT'S DO OR DIE.

262
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:27,955
THE LAST COUPLE LEFT STANDINGS
WINS REWARD.

263
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:32,293
YOU WILL TAKE YOUR LOVED ONE
BACK THE CAMP WHILE YOU HAVE A

264
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,669
"SURVIVOR" BARBECUE.

265
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:34,170
WORTH PLAYING FOR?

266
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:34,670
>> YES, SIR.

267
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:35,254
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

268
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:38,674
I'LL PASS OUT THE BAGS.

269
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,676
DON'T OPEN THEM YET.

270
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,177
EVERYBODY GOOD?

271
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,845
>> YES.

272
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:43,345
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

273
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,346

JUST LIKE THAT, LAUREN HAS NO
CONTROL IN THIS GAME.

282
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,660
ALL RIGHT.

283
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,078

PULL OUT ONE MARBLE.

286
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,375
MIKE DRAWS WHITE.

287
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,377

NO MATCH FOR MIKE AND BARRY.

296
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,686
RYAN IS DEVASTATED.

297
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,312

00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:49,912
BEN AND KELLY ARE OUR FIRST
LOVED ONES MATCHED.

304
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:50,871
THEY STAY ALIVE.

305
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,958
THEY HAVE A SHOT AT GUARANTEEING
LOVE.

306
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,794
CHRISSY, YOU'RE UP.

307
00:13:56,877 --> 00:14:00,089

00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,597
NOW WE MOVE TO ASHLEY.

312

00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:37,459
BEN AND HIS WIFE, CHRISSY AND
HER HUSBAND, LET'S GET IT ON.

323
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:43,048

KELLY HAS THE MATCH.

328
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,474
SHE DOES NOT.

329
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,144
CHRISSY AND KEITH HAVE TO MATCH
TO WIN.

330
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,146
OTHERWISE WE HAVE ANOTHER ROUND.

331
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,148
CHRISSY, THE DOOR IS OPEN.

332
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,691
BEN AND KELLY DIDN'T MATCH.

IF YOU MATCH YOUR HUSBAND, YOU
WIN LOVE.

334
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,779
YOU'RE IN CONTROL.

335

CHRISSY DRAWS WHITE.

336
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,035

WHITE MEANS CHRISSY AND KEITH
ARE IN CONTROL OF LOVE.

338
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:18,334
BLACK MEANS WE DO ANOTHER ROUND.

339
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,043

340
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,711

CHRISSY AND KEITH, YOU'RE IN
CHARGE OF LOVE.

347
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,897
YOU'RE GOING BACK THE CAMP.

348
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,190
>> AND CAN WE BRING A FRIEND?

349
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,232
>> Jeff: YOU'RE GOING TO BRING
A FRIEND.

350
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:46,862
PICK ONE "SURVIVOR" AND THEIR
LOVED ONE TO SHOW YOU.

351
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:49,698
>> RYAN AND STEVE.

352
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,240
>> Jeff: YOU DIDN'T EVEN
HESITATES.

353
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,202
>> Jeff: COME ON OVER.

354
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:57,206
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

355
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,209
>> Jeff: CHOOSE ONE MORE
AMERICAN AND THEIR ONE TO JOIN

356
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,212
YOU BACK AT CAMP FOR A
ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME EXPERIENCE.

357
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,840
>> DR. MIKE AND BARRY.

358
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:10,219
>> Jeff: DR. MIKE AND BARRY,
COME ON OVER.

359
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,929
>> THANK YOU.

360
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,097
THANK YOU.

361
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,557
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, YOU HAVE ONE
SPOT LEFT AT THE "SURVIVOR"

362
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,141
BARBECUE.

363
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,059
WHO IS YOUR LAST CHOICE?

364
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,020
>> ASHLEY AND JIM.

365
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,064
>> Jeff: NO HESITATION ONCE
AGAIN.

366
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:27,111
LIKE AN ASSASSIN.

367
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,070
ALL RIGHT.

368
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,573
GUYS, TIME TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

369
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,116
>> NINE DAYS, BABY.

370
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,200
>> HANG IN THERE.

371
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,035
YOU CAN DO IT.

372
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,453
BYE.

373
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,081
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, BECAUSE OF
YOU, YOU GUYS ARE ALL GOING BACK

374
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,457
THE CAMP.

375
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,333
ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME EXPERIENCE.

376
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,334
BEN, LAUREN, DEVON, GOT NOTHING
FOR YOU.

377
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,671
GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK,
ENJOY THE AFTERNOON.

378
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,716
>> POOR BEN PICKED THE WRONG
TIME TO PICK A FIGHT WITH ME,

379
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,469
BECAUSE HE DID NOT GET TO SEE
HIS SWEET KELLY.

380
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,222
AND NOW I'M GOING THE MAKE SURE
HE REGRETS THAT HE EVER CROSSED

381
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,307
ME.

382
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:15,951
>> YOU HAVE AN ANT ON YOUR --
>> THERE ARE SO MANY ANTS HERE

383
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:16,618
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

384
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,454
>> HOW MANY ANTS HAVE YOU EATEN?

385
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,663
>> HUNDREDS.

386
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:24,918
>> I HAVE NOT BEEN ALIGNED WITH
MIKE AT ALL, BUT AS OF LAST

387
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,295
NIGHT, HE'S AT THE BOTTOM, AND
US TWO ARE AT THE BOTTOM.

388
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:30,174
>> WHERE DOES ASHLEY STAND WITH
THE OTHER THREE?

389
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,425
>> THAT'S HER GROUP.

390
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:35,429
THE REASON I PICKED ASHLEY IS I
FELT LIKE ASHLEY WOULD BE THE

391
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:41,310
EASIEST OF THE FOUR TO BREAK.

392
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:46,607
IT'S A LONG SHOT, BUT IF I CAN
BRING JUST ONE PERSON OVER TO

393
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,359
OUR SIDE, THEN WE HAVE THE
MAJORITY IN NUMBERS AND CAN

394
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,154
CRIMINAL THE NEXT VOTE.

395
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,280
-- CAN CONTROL THE NEXT VOTE.

396
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,949
>> YOU WANT A FOUR-PERSON
ALLIANCE RIGHT NOW WITH THREE

397
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:56,784
PEOPLE THAT WILL TAKE YOUR
MILLION DOLLARS.

398
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:00,287
YOUR ALLIANCE NOW IS LIKE
POWERHOUSES.

399
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:05,167
SO JUST GIVE SOME THOUGHT AS TO
IF THE THREE OF US CAN HELP YOU

400
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,376
GET RID OF YOUR COMPETITION.

401
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,213
>> UH-HUH.

402
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,005
WHO ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

403
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:12,049
>> BEN.

404
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,343
HE'S PHYSICAL, SOCIAL, HE'S
FOUGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY IN IRAQ.

405
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,346
>> THAT'S TRUE.

406
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:21,475
>> OF COURSE CHRISSY IS GOING TO
SAY ANYTHING SHE CAN TO GET

407
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:24,019
ANOTHER NUMBER ON HER SIDE, BUT
IT IS INTERESTING, BECAUSE SHE

408
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:25,646
MIGHT BE RIGHT.

409
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:29,483
BOTH ALLIANCES KNOW THAT BEN IS
A HUGE THREAT AT THE END, SO DO

410
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:33,153
I JUST GO AHEAD AND INITIATE
THAT RIGHT NOW TO BE ABLE TO SAY

411
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,571
I MADE A BIG MOVE?

412
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:48,377
THAT'S THE QUESTION.

413
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,379
>> RYAN PLAYED AN IDOL AT
TRIBAL.

414
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,799
TRADITIONALLY ONCE AN IDOL IS
PLAYED, ONE COMES BACK INTO THE

415
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,008
GAME.

416
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:58,887
WITH THAT ONE COMING BACK INTO
THE GAME, WE NEED TO FIND IT.

417
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:03,350
SO I DECIDED TO MAKE A FAKE IDOL
AND I'M GOING TO PLANT THAT

418
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:07,062
SOMEWHERE WHILE I'M LOOKING FOR
THE REAL IDOL.

419
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:12,776
FAKE IMMUNITY NECKLACE, REAL
IMMUNITY NECKLACE.

420
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:17,406
IF CHRISSY, MIKE, OR RYAN FIND
THIS FAKE IDOL, THEY'LL STOP

421
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,366
LOOKING, AND THAT WILL GIVE US
MORE TIME THE LOOK FOR THE REAL

422
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:22,870
ONE.

423
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:26,707
>> I TOOK THAT PIECE OF STRING
AND ALL MY SHELLS AND MADE AN

424
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,249
IDOL OUT OF IT.

425
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:31,128
>> OH, MY GOD.

426
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,629
DUDE, YOU DID A GOOD JOB.

427
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:36,550
BEN MADE HIS OWN IDOL, AND IT
LOOK REALLY LEGIT.

428
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,594
TURNS OUT BEN'S PRETTY CRAFTY.

429
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,887
I'M IMPRESSED, BEN.

430
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,306
>> YOU HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO,
THE FAKE IDOL AND SEARCHING FOR

431
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,432
THE IDOL.

432
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,435
BEN'S GOT THIS FAKE IDOL, BUT
WHAT IS IT GOING TO DO?

433
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,896
WHO IS IT GOING TO BENEFIT?

434
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:54,109
>> I HOPE CHRISSY FINDS THAT
DAMN FAKE ADOLL.

435
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:56,361
HE WANTS CHRISSY TO GIVE THAT
FAKE IDOL AND WATCH JEFF THROW

436
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,114
IT IN THE FIRE AND JUST
EMBARRASS HERSELF.

437
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:01,909
THAT'S JUST BECAUSE HE HAS A
PERSONAL THING AGAINST CHRISSY,

438
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,786
AND THAT'S MY PROBLEM WITH BEN.

439
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:12,169
HE'S TAKING ALL THESE FACTORS TO
THE PERSONAL LEVEL.

440
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,128
HEY, I GOT IT.

441
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:13,754
I GOT IT.

442
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:14,254
COME HERE.

443
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,465
I GOT IT RIGHT HERE.

444
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,258
YES, YOU WALKED RIGHT BY IT.

445
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:18,634
IT SAID DIG.

446
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,137
>> NO, WAY!

447
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,640
I FOUND HALF OF A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

448
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,475
NOW YOU JUST NEED TO SECURE THE
OTHER HALF AT NEXT IMMUNITY

449
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,559
CHALLENGE.

450
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:32,272
THERE WILL BE A SEASHELL IN
FRONT OF YOUR PLATFORM.

451
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,275
THIS IS THE OTHER HALF OF YOUR
IDOL.

452
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,320
BUT ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER HAS NO
POWER AT ALL.

453
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:42,824
AT THIS POINT THE ONLY PART I
HAVE IS A LEATHER STRING.

454
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,994
SO AT THE NEXT IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE, I HAVE TO GET THAT

455
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,080
SHELL TO MAKE IT COMPLETE FOR IT
TO BE IN PLAY.

456
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:13,522
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

457
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,439
ALL RIGHT.

458
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,526
SHALL WE GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE?

459
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,487
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, FIRST THINGS
FIRST, GOT TO TAKE BACK THE

460
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,196
NECKLACE.

461
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:24,366
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HELP AT ALL.

462
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:24,700
NOPE.

463
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:28,245
THANK YOU.

464
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:29,538
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.

465
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,874
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE YOUR ARMS

466
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,711
STRETCHED OUT WITH YOUR
FINGERTIPS PRESSED AGAINST TWO

467
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,547
WOODEN DISKS.

468
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:43,385
IF AT ANY POINT YOUR DISKS DROP,
YOU'RE OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

469
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:48,015
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS
IMMUNITY, GUARANTEED A ONE IN

470
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,767
SIX SHOT AT GETTING TO THE END.

471
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,562
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BECOME THE FIFTH

472
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,272
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

473
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,398
TAKE YOUR SPOTS.

474
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,734
WE'LL GET STARTED.

475
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:07,951
IT'S GOING TO HURT.

476
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,202
ALL RIGHT.

477
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:15,292
EVERYBODY IS IN POSITION, AND
THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.

478
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,545
THIS WILL HURT.

479
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:19,671
>> WILL?

480
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,589
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT HURTING?

481
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,216
>> IT ALREADY HURTS.

482
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,593
>>ING IN FEELS GOOD RIGHT NOW.

483
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:29,389
>> Jeff: EACH OF THESE
STATIONS MADE SPECIFICALLY FOR

484
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:38,106
YOU, AND THE DANCE BEGINS,
BODIES START TO SHIFT,

485
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,275
REPOSITIONING, A LITTLE SLIP
FROM CHRISSY.

486
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,277
THAT CHIME REPRESENTS HOPE.

487
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,612
YOU WANT THE HEAR THOSE THINGS
CLANGING.

488
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:49,451
BECAUSE WHEN THOSE DISKS DROP,
THOSE CHIMES STOP, AND YOU'RE

489
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:54,581
OUT.

490
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:59,419
ONE OF THE HOTTEST DAYS SO FAR
HERE IN FIJI THAT.

491
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:07,094
SUN POUNDING DOWN.

492
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,678
RYAN MOVING HIS DISKS AROUND.

493
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:09,805
BEN NOW REPOSITIONING.

494
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:14,184
A BIG STRETCH FROM BEN.

495
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,352
MORE MOVEMENT BY CHRISSY.

496
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:24,820
SHE DIGS INCH BEN READJUSTING
AGAIN.

497
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,154
RYAN DROPPING AGAIN.

498
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,491
VERY CLOSE TO THE EDGE OF DEATH.

499
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,493
CHRISSY NOW STARTING TO DROP.

500
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:36,331
THERE IS NOBODY THAT IS NOT
HURTING.

501
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:36,998
RYAN MOVING.

502
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,166
A LOT OF PEOPLE MOVING NOW.

503
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,336
WE'RE REACHING THAT CRITICAL
SPOT WHERE PEOPLE WILL START TO

504
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,212
DROP.

505
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,005
YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE YOU.

506
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,759
YOU HAVE TO DIG IN RIGHT NOW.

507
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,846
BEN ALL OVER THE PLACE SLIPPING.

508
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,180
MORE MOVEMENT.

509
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,348
ANOTHER NICE RECOVERY.

510
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,642
MORE MOVEMENT FROM BEN.

511
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:58,687
BEN IS FIGHTING TO STAY IN THIS.

512
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:03,525
AND RECOVERS AGAIN.

513
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:08,655
RYAN MOVING AGAIN.

514
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,407
BEN CANNOT HANG IN ANY LONGER.

515
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,992
BEN IS THE FIRST ONE OUT.

516
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:16,663
WE ARE DOWN TO SIX.

517
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,373
CHRISSY DROPS.

518
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,374
CHRISSY IS NOW OUT.

519
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:20,834
NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.

520
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,712
AND WE ARE DOWN TO FIVE.

521
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,548
RYAN WITH ANOTHER NICE RECOVERY.

522
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,675
STRETCHED TO YOUR LIMIT.

523
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:29,509
RYAN DROPS.

524
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,177
HE'S OUT.

525
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,054
WE'RE DOWN TO FOUR.

526
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:38,393
DEVON, ASHLEY, MIKE, AND LAUREN.

527
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:39,352
MIKE NOW WITH MOVEMENT.

528
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,188
>> GO AHEAD, MIKE.

529
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,566
DROP IT, DROP IT, MIKE.

530
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:49,571
>> NEVER!

531
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,407
>> Jeff: LAUREN JUST QUITS.

532
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:52,782
DIDN'T EVEN DROP.

533
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:53,742
>> I CAN'T.

534
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,745
MY SHOULDERS ARE DONE.

535
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:57,621
>> Jeff: LAUREN IS OUT.

536
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,873
YOU CAN TAKE A SEAT ON YOUR
PLATFORM.

537
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:02,918
AN WE ARE DOWN TO THREE.

538
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,003
DEVON, ASHLEY, AND MIKE.

539
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:33,281
NO WAY YOU COULD HAVE DREAMED IT
WOULD HURT THIS MUCH.

540
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:38,453
MOVEMENT FROM ASHLEY FOR THE
FIRST TIME IN THIS CHALLENGE.

541
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:39,788
>> HULA.

542
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,122
DO THE HULA.

543
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,749
>> Jeff: DEVON DOING A NICE
LITTLE HULA?

544
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,669
>> YEAH.

545
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:51,967
GOT TO MAKE SOME FUN OF THIS,
BECAUSE THIS SUCKS.

546
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,302
>> Jeff: MIKE DROPS AND WE ARE
DOWN TO TWO.

547
00:25:54,386 --> 00:26:00,475
IT IS DEVON AND ASHLEY, SIDE BY
SIDE, FIGHTING FOR IMMUNITY.

548
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:03,144
>> DO YOU WANT TO JUST FIGHT IT
OUT?

549
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,272
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?

550
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,649
>> Jeff: DEVON, WHY ARE YOU
BRINGING THIS UP?

551
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,651
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU KIND
OF WANT TO HAVE IT BE OVER?

552
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:14,739
>> ASHLEY AND I, IT'S KNOWN
ACROSS THIS WHOLE TRIBE, THAT WE

553
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,867
ARE STRONG ALLIES, AND EITHER
ONE OF US WEARING THAT NECKLACE

554
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,369
IS JUST AS GOOD IN MY EYES.

555
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:22,497
>> DREW: WOW, BEN, THAT IS A
BOLD STATEMENT ON DAY 33.

556
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:28,003
>> YEAH, YOU KNOW, IT COMES DOWN
TO BEING COMFORTABLE IN YOUR

557
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:28,795
ALLIANCE.

558
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:34,968
>> SHOULDER MASSAGES FOR THE
LOSER?

559
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:35,927
>> ALL RIGHT.

560
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:36,303
MASSAGE?

561
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,429
>> MASSAGE.

562
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,849
>> Jeff: DEVON NEGOTIATES HIS
WAY OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.

563
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:45,020
ASHLEY WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.

564
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,730
>> OH, MY GOD.

565
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:50,525
>> Jeff: ASHLEY, COME ON OVER.

566
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,235
>> I CAN'T FEEL MY FINGERS,
JEFF.

567
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:52,861
>> Jeff: TOTALLY NUMB?

568
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,029
>> OH, YEAH.

569
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,531
>> Jeff: ASHLEY ONCE AGAIN
SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

570
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:57,866
CANNOT BE VOTED OUT OF THIS
GAME.

571
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:01,411
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 33
VERY, VERY TOUGH DAYS, SOMEBODY

572
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:04,873
GOING HOME TONIGHT, WILL BECOME
THE FIFTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

573
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:05,290
CONGRATS.

574
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,207
>> THANK YOU.

575
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,878
>> PICKING UP THE SHELL
COMPLETED THE IDOL.

576
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:16,384
SO WITH SEVEN OF US AND FOUR OF
US VOTING THE SAME WAY, SO CASE

577
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:16,885
CLOSED.

578
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,012
RYAN GOING HOME.

579
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:32,400
>> WAY TO GO.

580
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,027
>> GOOD JOB, ASHLEY.

581
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,570
>> NICE JOB DEVON ALSO.

582
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,906
>> YOU WERE RIGHT THERE.

583
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:42,077
>> I HAD A FEELING YOU WERE
GOING TO WIN ANYWAY, SO I WAS

584
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,244
LIKE, MIGHT AS WELL GET DOWN.

585
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:47,290
>> HAVING THE IMMUNITY NECKLACE
AT TRIBAL WILL FEEL AMAZING.

586
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,541
I SEE MYSELF IN A GREAT
POSITION.

587
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,752
I HAVE AN ALLIANCE THAT I CAN
TRUST, AND WE HAVE THE NUMBERS,

588
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:55,590
BUT I REALIZED I MAY NOT HAVE
THAT MANY BIG MOVES ON MY

589
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:59,636
RESUME, AND FOR ME TO WIN THIS
GAME, I GOT TO GET RID OF THE

590
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,931
STRONGER PLAYERS.

591
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:08,144
I'VE GONE BACK AND FORTH ON
WANTING TO DO THIS.

592
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:08,853
SHOULD WE JUST GET RID OF BEN?

593
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,939
HONESTLY I'M LEANING TOWARD BEN.

594
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,858
>> I THINK CHRISSY IS MORE OF A
CHALLENGE THREAT THAN BEN?

595
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:17,779
>> WELL, IF THEY'RE BOTH GOING,
I JUST WISH WE WOULD VOTE BEN

596
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:18,613
OUT FIRST.

597
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:21,408
>> ASHLEY STILL WANTS TO VOTE
OUT BEN.

598
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,952
SHE SEES HIM BEING THE BIGGEST
THREAT IN THIS GAME.

599
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,830
BUT I SEE CHRISSY BEING A
THREAT, TOO.

600
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:32,085
DUE THE CHALLENGE CAPABILITIES
AND BEING SOMEONE WHO THE JURY

601
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:34,921
MIGHT WANT TO SEE WIN THE
MILLION DOLLARS IN THE END.

602
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:39,134
I SAY CHRISSY BEFORE BEN, BUT I
AGREE WITH YOU THAT BEN SHOULD

603
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:44,305
GO.

604
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,473
>> OH, MAN.

605
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:49,811
>> I CAME UP ON THE WELL AND I
SEE DEVON, ASHLEY, AND LAUREN

606
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,062
TALKING UNDER THEIR BREATH.

607
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:54,649
I HEARD MY NAME, AND THEN THEY
SEEN ME COMING AND THEY STOPPED

608
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:55,483
TALKING.

609
00:28:55,567 --> 00:29:02,657
THE WHOLE THING WAS REALLY
SUSPICIOUS.

610
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:02,949
>> IS EVERYTHING ALL GOOD?

611
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:08,788
>> YEAH.

612
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:12,959
>> SO WHO IS DO YOU WANT THE SEE
GO?

613
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,836
>> CHRISSY.

614
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,171
>> FINE WITH ME.

615
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,007
>> SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY GOING
ON AROUND HERE.

616
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,843
THEY'RE SAYING IT'S CHRISSY, BUT
I FEEL LIKE THERE IS A CHANCE

617
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,344
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE ME.

618
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,973
SO I GOT TO DO WHATEVER I HAVE
TO DO TO KEEP MYSELF IN THE

619
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,893
GAME.

620
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:33,771
>> I'M GETTING PARANOID.

621
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:38,359
>> I FEEL LIKE WE'RE VERY CLOSE.

622
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,196
>> AND LAUREN IN ON THAT.

623
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,156
SO ARE YOU WILLING TO MAKE A BIG
MOVE WITH ME?

624
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:46,367
>> I'M ALWAYS WILLING TO MAKE A
BIG MOVE, YOU KNOW THAT.

625
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:50,079
>> WELL, DURING THE FAMILY
VISIT, LAUREN FOUND THE IDOL.

626
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,998
IT WAS A TWO-PART IDOL.

627
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,876
ONE OF IT WAS AER CORD, AND THEN
THE OTHER PART WAS AT THE

628
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,880
CHALLENGE TODAY, THAT SEASHELL
SHE PICKED UP.

629
00:29:58,963 --> 00:29:59,839
THAT IS AN IDOL.

630
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,550
SO SHE IS TOO POWERFUL IN THIS
GAME RIGHT NOW.

631
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,719
SHE HAS AN IDOL AND AN EXTRA
VOTE.

632
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:08,348
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS THROUGH, BUT
LAUREN HAS ALL THESE ADVANTAGES,

633
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,016
SO BEN WANTS TO GET RID OF HER.

634
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:13,770
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I FEEL LIKE
I'M BACK ON TOP.

635
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,898
SO NEVER UNDERESTIMATE DR. MIKE.

636
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:17,565
SO LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS.

637
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:22,237
WE GOT CHRISSY AND YOU, RIGHT?

638
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,196
ME AND THEN MIKE.

639
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,322
THAT'S FOUR VERSUS THREE.

640
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,573
AND SHE GOES HOME.

641
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,074
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, DUDE?

642
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,617
>> OKAY.

643
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,618
>> TRUST ME ON THIS.

644
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:29,077
>> OKAY.

645
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,246
>> I WAS SHOCKED.

646
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,747
BEN WANTS THE VOTE OUT LAUREN.

647
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:36,918
NOW HE WAS VERY VAGUE, BUT
THAT'S ALL I NEEDED TO HEAR,

648
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,462
BECAUSE AS LONG AS THE TARGET IS
NOT ON ME, I'M DOWN.

649
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:44,092
THE PROBLEM IS, FOR THIS TO
WORK, WE NEED CHRISSY, WHO HATES

650
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,218
BEN.

651
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,095
>> HERE'S THE THING, I DON'T
WANT IT TO BE ME TONIGHT.

652
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,305
>> I KNOW.

653
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,266
>> IF YOU CAN JUST HEAR ME OUT.

654
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,434
>> YEAH.

655
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,103
>> THERE ARE BIG THREATS IN THIS
GAME.

656
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,479
>> I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.

657
00:30:56,563 --> 00:31:00,066
>> OKAY.

658
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:03,945
>> CHRISSY VOTING DEVON?

659
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:07,240
>> DEVON, WHY DO YOU THINK I
WOULD TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT

660
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,534
OUR CONVERSATION CONSIDERING
WHAT HAPPENED AT THE LAST TRIBAL

661
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:10,702
COUNCIL?

662
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,245
>> I WAS TRYING THE TALK TO
CHRISSY, AND SHE JUST BLEW ME

663
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:13,329
OFF.

664
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,957
SHE'S HOLDING A GRUDGE IN THIS
GAME, AND TAKING IT TOO

665
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,666
PERSONAL.

666
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,793
HALF OF ME WAS LIKE, SCREW IT.

667
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:20,128
I HAVE AN IDOL.

668
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:24,340
ON THE OTHER HAND, I'D RATHER
SAVE IT FOR THE FIVE, AND TO DO

669
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,092
THAT, I'M GOING TO NEED CHRISSY.

670
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,302
>> ALL RIGHT.

671
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,847
I'M SORRY IF I OFFENDED YOU IN
ANY WAY, BUT MOVING FORWARD, I

672
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,140
STILL WANT TO WORK WITH YOU IN
THIS GAME.

673
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:36,936
>> BEN, I HAVE BEEN TOTALLY
BLIND SIDED AT THE LAST TWO

674
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,270
TRIBALS.

675
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,438
>> RIGHT.

676
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:41,274
>> YOU HAVE GIVEN ACADEMY
AWARD-WINNING PERFORMANCES, AND

677
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,985
NOW I LOOK BACK AND REALIZE THE
THING WAS A TOTAL SHAM.

678
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:48,448
>> YOU CAN VOTE WHICHEVER WAY
YOU WANT TO, BUT LAUREN HAS AN

679
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,824
EXTRA VOTE.

680
00:31:49,907 --> 00:31:51,492
LAUREN ALSO HAS AN IMMUNITY
IDOL.

681
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,702
SHE HAS TOO MUCH POWER IN THE
GAME.

682
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:56,998
>> I WAS READY TO GO TO TRIBAL
AND VOTE FOR BEN, BUT, OH, MY

683
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:00,376
GOD, IF BY VOTING OUT LAUREN
THAT WILL KEEP ME SAFE, I HAVE

684
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,337
TO CONSIDER IT.

685
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,883
>> IF WE GET LAUREN OUT, ME,
YOU, RYAN AND MIKE WILL HAVE

686
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:07,675
CONTROL OF THE GAME.

687
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,343
>> OKAY.

688
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,677
>> WE'RE BACK IN IT TOGETHER.

689
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,178
>> OKAY.

690
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:10,845
THANK YOU, BEN.

691
00:32:10,928 --> 00:32:12,513
>> I'M GOING TO GO THIS WAY.

692
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,014
>> OKAY.

693
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,265
I'M GOING TO GO BACK.

694
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,352
>> THE PROBLEM IS FOR SIX DAYS
BEN HAS LIED TO ME AND USED ME,

695
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:22,357
SO HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO TRUST
HIM KNOWING THAT HE MIGHT JUST

696
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,526
COME BACK TO CAMP AND SAY, HA,
HA, I DUPED YOU AGAIN.

697
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,864
>> I KNOW YOU'RE MAD AT BEN, AND
SO AM I, BUT IF WE CAN BLINDSIDE

698
00:32:29,947 --> 00:32:33,242
SOMEBODY WITH AN IDOL AND AN
EXTRA VOTE, THAT'S A HUGE PLUS.

699
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,702
>> THIS GAME IS SO HARD.

700
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:35,662
>> I KNOW.

701
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,372
>> RIGHT NOW I'M LEANING TOWARD
VOTING BEN.

702
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,832
>> CHRISSY WON'T COMMIT TO
TAKING OUT LAUREN.

703
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,250
THIS IS VENGEANCE MORE THAN
ANYTHING ELSE.

704
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:44,045
SHE'S PLAYING EMOTIONALLY AT
THIS POINT.

705
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,005
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN TONIGHT.

706
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:52,095
SO IT'S "SURVIVOR" RULE NUMBER
TWO, HAVE A PLAN "B."

707
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,389
>> WHAT DID HE TELL YOU?

708
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,265
>> THINGS YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME.

709
00:32:56,349 --> 00:33:02,313
IDOLS, ADVANTAGES, AND LAUREN
HAS TO GO.

710
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:05,233
>> WHAT?

711
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,193
WOW.

712
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:11,614
>> THINGS ARE GETTING CRAZY.

713
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,741
BEN IS TRYING THE BLIND SIDE
YOU.

714
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,410
APPARENTLY HE'S TOLD EARN ABOUT
EVERYTHING.

715
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,954
>> HE TOLD CHRISSY ABOUT THE
IDOL.

716
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,080
>> AND YOU ADVANTAGE.

717
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,041
>> I JUST HEARD THAT BEN IS
TRYING THE BLIND SIDE ME.

718
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,459
I'M LIKE, WHAT THE HELL IS GOING
ON.

719
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:28,089
SO YOU KNOW, I HAVE THAT EXTRA
VOTE, BUT FIRST I WANT TO SEE IF

720
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:31,092
I CAN'T GET THE NUMBERS BACK ON
MY SIDE.

721
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:34,095
HERE, YOU CAN HAVE THE OTHER
HALF OF THAT.

722
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:38,099
THAT'S THE PART I GOT TODAY.

723
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,517
>> THANK YOU.

724
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,563
>> LAUREN GAVE ME A PIECE OF THE
IDOL TO SAY, LOOK, I TRUST YOU.

725
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:47,233
AND IT FALLS INTO THOSE LIKE
STUPIDEST MOVES EVER IN

726
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,484
"SURVIVOR" HISTORY.

727
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:52,947
AND THE ONLY QUESTION IS DO THE
"SURVIVOR" GODS MAKE HER PAY FOR

728
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,074
IT OR NOT.

729
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:14,677
>> Jeff: WE NOW BRING IN THE
MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

730
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:26,314
DESI, COLE, J.P., AND JOE VOTED
OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

731
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:30,276
SO LET'S START WITH TODAY'S
IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

732
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,821
DEVON AND ASHLEY WERE VERY UP
FRONT ABOUT SAYING, WE'RE A

733
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,323
PAIR, EVERYBODY KNOWS IT, IN
FACT, THEY NEGOTIATED A DEAL.

734
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,325
DEVON STEPPED DOWN IN EXCHANGE
FOR A SHOULDER RUB.

735
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,494
ASHLEY WINS IMMUNITY.

736
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,369
NOBODY SEEMED TO MIND.

737
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:43,039
>> JEFF, LET ME CLEAR THINGS UP.

738
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:46,334
I WAS JUST SENDING MY MESSAGE OF
TRUST TO MY ALLIANCE.

739
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:50,463
IT WOULDN'T HAVE MATTERED IF IT
WAS LAUREN OR ASHLEY.

740
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:51,506
>> I THOUGHT I WAS PART OF THAT,
TOO.

741
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:55,843
SO NOT HEARING MY NAME IN THAT
IS KIND OF CONCERNING.

742
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,303
>> Jeff: ASHLEY, YOUR EYES ARE
HUGE.

743
00:34:57,386 --> 00:35:00,890
>> YEAH, JEFF, IT'S SAFE THE SAY
THAT THE PRESSURE OF THIS GAME

744
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,683
IS GETTING TO SOME PEOPLE.

745
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,686
AND NOW PEOPLE THAT WERE AT THE
BOTTOM ARE MAYBE SAFE TONIGHT

746
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,357
AND PEOPLE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN
VERY SAFE ARE POTENTIALLY NOT.

747
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,566
>> Jeff: OKAY.

748
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:14,862
BECAUSE OF WHAT BEN SAID, THE
ONLY THING I COULD DEDUCE FROM

749
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:15,988
THAT CRYPTIC ANSWER IS BEN.

750
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,490
>> I'D SAY YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT.

751
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:21,160
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, THEN LET'S GET
THE PLAYING THE GAME.

752
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:24,413
>> WHAT, WHAT PART OF A GAME
MOVE WAS YOU TELLING PEOPLE

753
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,207
ABOUT THE IDOL?

754
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,375
WHERE WAS THAT A GAME MOVE?

755
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,168
>> THAT WAS PART OF MY GAME.

756
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,754
>> WE GOT A GAME FOR YOU, TOO,
SO GO AHEAD.

757
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,381
>> THAT'S WHAT I MEANT BY
MESSING UP YOUR OWN GAME,

758
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,384
>> EXACTLY, BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN
PARANOID.

759
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,344
IF YOU'RE IN AN ALLIANCE, YOU
NEED TO HAVE TRUST WITH THAT

760
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,428
ALLIANCE.

761
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,305
>> LIKE AT THE WELL WHEN YOU
SENATORS SHOULD EXPECT OFF

762
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,515
WHISPERING.

763
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:46,394
>> WE'RE NOT WHISPERING, AND YOU
TRYING TO PORTRAY ME HAS NOT

764
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,270
REALLY GOT YOU ANYWHERE.

765
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,354
>> I WAS DEFINITELY GUNNING FOR
YOU TODAY.

766
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:52,567
>> WELL, I HOPE YOU GOT A LOT OF
AMMUNITION.

767
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,068
>> Jeff: WOW.

768
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,236
IT'S ON.

769
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,113
>> WELL, I THINK ONE OF THE
REASONS THAT LAUREN BECAME THE

770
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,407
TARGET IS BECAUSE LAUREN HAS THE
ADVANTAGE THAT ALLOWS HER AN

771
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,533
EXTRA VOTE.

772
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:03,411
I PERSONALLY WOULD RECOMMEND
THAT YOU JUST FORFEIT THE

773
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,330
ADVANTAGE AND GIVE IT TO JEFF...

774
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,915
>> IT'S BEEN RIPPED UP.

775
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:08,624
THE ADVANTAGE WAS...

776
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,126
>> YOU RIPPED THE ADVANTAGE OF.

777
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,836
>> WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE
IDOL.

778
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,087
>> YOU STILL HAVE THE ADVANTAGE.

779
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:13,880
>> THE ADVANTAGE IS AT CAMP.

780
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,215
I HAVE TO PHYSICALLY HAVE IT
HERE.

781
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,259
>> SO RIGHT NOW YOU CANNOT USE
THE ADVANTAGE.

782
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,260
>> I CANNOT USE THE ADVANTAGE.

783
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,722
>> SO THEORETICALLY WE COULD
VOTE 4-3 AGAINST YOU.

784
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:26,225
>> DO WHATEVER YOU ALL FEEL THE
NEED TO DO.

785
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,270
>> Jeff: SO I'M STILL UNCLEAR
ON THE IDOL.

786
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,522
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE EVERYBODY
KNOWS EVERYTHING.

787
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,775
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THERE ARE
ANY SECRETS.

788
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,444
>> HE HAS PART OF IT.

789
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:41,449
BUT MIND YOU, YOU HAVE BEN BACK
THERE WHO IS PLAN WAS TO TAKE

790
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,409
HIS FAKE IDOL AND GIVE IT TO
CHRISSY.

791
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:47,121
>> I TOOK THE FAKE IDOL OUT OF
PLAY BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE

792
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:49,081
A PERSONAL ATTACK AGAINST
CHRISSY.

793
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,249
>> WHOA NOW.

794
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,753
>> AS FAR AS FAKE IDOLS GO,
THAT'S A PRETTY DARN GOOD FAKE

795
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:54,962
IDOL.

796
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,466
>> THIS IS THE REAL IDOL, AND I
WANTED TO DO THIS FOR LIKE 15

797
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:12,271
YEARS, IT WILL NEVER BE PLAYED.

798
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:16,150
>> Jeff: MIKE, VERY INTERESTED
YOU DECIDED, WE DON'T WANT

799
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:19,487
IDOLS, WE DON'T WANT ADVANTAGES,
BUT YOU'RE TEMPTING THE

800
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,489
"SURVIVOR" GODS WHEN YOU HAVE
THE MOST VALUABLE THING IN THE

801
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:25,660
GAME AND YOU THROW IT IN THE
FIRE WILLINGLY, WHAT'S THE

802
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,827
REASONING BEHIND THAT?

803
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,497
>> AN IDOL ANDERSON ADVANTAGE IS
A BLESSING AND A CURSE.

804
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,999
SO PEOPLE ARE SHUNNING THEM AND
TRYING TO GET RID OF THEM.

805
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,501
>> BUT THE CURSE HE MENTIONS IS
BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE KNOWN

806
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:34,251
ABOUT IT.

807
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,712
THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN EXPOSED
TODAY.

808
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:41,342
>> JEFF, HERE'S WHAT'S PEOPLE
ARE SAYING AT HOME: DON'T REVEAL

809
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,636
YOU HAVE AN IDOL OR AN
ADVANTAGE.

810
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,805
>> THE EXTRA VOTE IS NOT BEING
PLAYED.

811
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:48,474
>> YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT
IT'S REALLY HARD ONCE WE GET TO

812
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:48,933
SIX...

813
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:49,767
>> DO YOU WANT IT?

814
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,395
YOU CAN HAVE IT
>> GIVE IT TO CHRISSY.

815
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,438
>> I'LL TAKE IT.

816
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:58,025
>> HOW DO WE KNOW THAT'S
ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN.

817
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,695
>> WHY DON'T WE LEAVE IT TO
LAUREN AND SEND HER HOME.

818
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,489
>> LAUREN WITH AN EXTRA VOTE
ISN'T AS DANGEROUS AS YOU

819
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:04,573
TELLING EVERYONE EVERYTHING.

820
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:05,533
WHO TRUSTS YOU?

821
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:06,617
NO ONE.

822
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,245
AT THIS POINT, NOT A SINGLE
PERSON HERE TRUSTS YOU.

823
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,372
>> YOU HAD AN ALLIANCE THAT WAS
GOOD UNTIL

824
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,040
>> YOU'LL SEE.

825
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:13,624
>> I DIDN'T TRUST YOU THREE.

826
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,668
THAT'S WHY I...

827
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:16,585
>> EXACTLY.

828
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,421
I HAVEN'T HAD AN ALLIANCE.

829
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:21,424
>> I'M INTO IT RIGHT NOW.

830
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,384
ADMIT TO YOU THROWING HER
NAME...

831
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,219
>> I DON'T TRUST YOU ANYMORE.

832
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:25,886
>> OKAY.

833
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,888
THAT'S FINE.

834
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:32,309
>> Jeff: CHRISSY, PLAQUE MAIL
FOR AN EXTRA VOTE, WHAT MIGHT BE

835
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,894
AN IDOL BURNING IN THE FIRE.

836
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,604
IT REALLY IS ABSOLUTE CHAOS.

837
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:39,942
>> IT IS, AND HEARING THEM
TALKING ABOUT HOW TIGHT THEIR

838
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:44,071
ALLIANCE IS MAKES ME MORE SURE
THAT AT THE NEXT TRIBAL IT WOULD

839
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,281
BE ME.

840
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,199
>> YOU'RE THE BIGGEST THREAT IN
THE GAME, LAUREN.

841
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:53,539
>> OBVIOUSLY WE'RE ALL THREATS,
SO WHAT THE HELL?

842
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,458
>> LET'S GET RID OF BEN?

843
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,251
>> YOU CAN GO.

844
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:57,877
I DON'T CARE.

845
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:03,924
>> I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

846
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,427
>> Jeff: WE DON'T NEED
CHRISSY.

847
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,388
LET'S JUST GET IT OVER WITH.

848
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,806
>> GET RID OF BEN?

849
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,475
>> NOPE, NOPE, NOPE.

850
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:15,061
>> WOW.

851
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,395
>> SHE HAD THE ADVANTAGE.

852
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,605
>> WHY WOULD YOU USE THAT...

853
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:21,233
>> BEN, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS
GOING ON OVER HERE.

854
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:25,279
>> THEY'RE DECIDING WHETHER TO
SPEND ME OR LAWN HOME.

855
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:26,447
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M DOING?

856
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,115
I'M WRITING HER NAME DOWN.

857
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:28,783
I'LL SAY IT.

858
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,284
>> WE KNEW THAT A LONG TIME AGO.

859
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:31,452
>> OH, I KNOW.

COUNCIL IN WHICH EVERYTHING WAS

OUT IN THE OPEN, AND YET THE ONE
THING THAT HAD THE MOST POWER

PRETTY MUCH HERE IS MY DUMB-DUMB

SELF GAVE MIKE A PIECE OF A
HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
