choice.

You have to choose somebody from

>> No. I thought this would be,

like, I'm out.

239
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,386
Now would be a good time to

exit.

241

>> PROBST: Well, so I guess you

242
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,597
just told these guys that you're

243
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,558
fine going home.

out your head, you'll come back

260
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,538
wanting to play.

261
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,540
The good news, Lisi, whether you

262
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,958
think so or not, you won't be

263
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,293
going to Tribal Council, which

264
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,544
means you can't be voted out.

265
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,503
You will return after the next

266
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,755

268
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,301
and had to vote somebody out.

269
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,303
Also, there is another clue to

270
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,387
the whereabouts of a hidden

272
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:52,805
Perhaps you'll find it, won't

273
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,807
want it, we'll give it to

274
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:55,850
somebody who does.

Which group is going to live on

the luxurious Moto Beach...

284
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,243

Do it.

00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,441
>> Y'all eat, y'all serve your

383
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,901
own selves first.

384
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,403
>> Eat slow so you don't, you

385
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,445
know, you don't get sick.

386
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,406
>> This is real food. Man!

387
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,865
>> Oh, this is good cheese.

388
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:40,991
>> Anything is good at this

389
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:41,700
point.

390
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,284
>> I'm trying to just, like,

391
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,869
keep myself contained.

392
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,080
>> After I survey the land and

393
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,415
look at the situation a little

394
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,916
more, um, I will be looking for

395
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,000
the Immunity Idol.

396
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:50,793
Yau and I have an upper hand,

397
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,337
'cause we're the only ones that

398
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:53,963
know about Exile Island and the

399
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,840
clues and what's going on.

400
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,883
So I am not worried, not at all,

401
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,553
about someone else trying to

402
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,178
find the idol, 'cause they have

403
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,264
no idea that it's even on this

404
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:03,764
island.

405
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:07,560
(chattering and whooping)

406
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,811
>> I'm gonna have a mimosa.

407
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:09,145
>> Oh, a mimosa?

408
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,272
Don't you dare have a hangover.

409
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,106
>> Guys, cheers.

410
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:12,648
>> Yummy.

411
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:13,649
>> To the new Moto.

412
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,151
>> OTHERS: To the new Moto.

413
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,235
>> New Moto.

414
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,321
>> Moto-licious, baby.

415
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:32,710
>> Oh, my God, let's eat!

416
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:33,502
Let's eat!

417
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,504
>> Big morale went up.

418
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,088
Don't let this morale go down.

419
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:36,964
>> Well, I'll tell you, it's

420
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,507
rough out here.

421
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,383
>> I want to say something,

422
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:39,633
though.

423
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,010
There was two choices-- either

424
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,178
had that tribe over there...

425
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,345
>> Don't worry about it.

426
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,180
Don't worry about it.

427
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,181
>> No, no, no, but I'm saying,

428
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,348
like, we're gonna be way

429
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,475
stronger in challenges, and if

430
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,100
tomorrow we have a challenge, we

431
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:48,976
kick ass, man.

432
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,352
>> Yeah.

433
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,437
>> We're gonna kick some ass.

434
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,563
It's men now.

435
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:52,980
(several talking)

436
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:56,233
>> Men! Yeah!

437
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,318
>> Showing up here, you know,

438
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,527
it's really not that bad.

439
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,529
>> Whoa!

440
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,030
>> Yeah, I had a strong

441
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,907
alliance-- it was Boo, Stacy,

442
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,950
Lisi and myself-- um, but I

443
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,577
always felt there was kind of a

444
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,495
power struggle.

445
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,329
The girls were difficult to

446
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:08,954
predict.

447
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,289
I wasn't sure where Boo stood

448
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,291
half the time.

449
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,751
So being in a tribe where I feel

450
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:14,293
like, you know, we're all

451
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,128
gung-ho, we're all warriors,

452
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,254
we're ready to take these guys

453
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,215
on, I'm very happy with it.

454
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,633
(whooping)

455
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:21,217
And this may sound weird, but,

456
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,093
like, I'm glad that there are no

457
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:23,469
women here, man.

458
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,803
The women are just politics

459
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:25,763
and it's just, like...

460
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:26,722
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

461
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:27,556
>> That's why... that's why

462
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,974
every person that's been voted

463
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,392
off has been a woman, you know

464
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,352
what I mean?

465
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,102
>> It's just, like, I was

466
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,687
getting so sick of dealing with

467
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:33,938
them.

468
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:34,522
>> I-I only need to ask one

469
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,439
question.

470
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,441
How was Sylvia in camp, man?

471
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,484
(laughter)

472
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:39,068
>> Shoot myself in the face...

473
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:39,860
>> That's why she was out.

474
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,279
>> Just excited to, you know, be

475
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:42,988
eating, hanging out with some of

476
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,323
the boys.

477
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,741
No offense, I love women, I love

478
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,368
'em, I love to touch 'em and

479
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,370
make out and have conversations

480
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,371
with 'em, get along well.

481
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,039
But, uh, you know, in this type

482
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,249
of environment, this type of

483
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,833
game, you don't need any, like,

484
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,126
stupid, like, girl stories or

485
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,711
distractions or any stupid

486
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:58,420
things like that.

487
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,463
>> There's a little quote that

488
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,089
gets me through, like, a lot of,

489
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,507
like, rough times.

490
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,800
I don't know if you ever seen

491
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:03,968
<i>The Count of Monte Cristo,</i> the

492
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:04,426
movie.

493
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:04,843
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

494
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,136
>> It starts out, there's a line

495
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,098
in it that goes, um... "Life is

496
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:09,890
a storm, my young friends.

497
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,058
One day you're battered in the

498
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,977
sunlight, and you're shattered

499
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,936
on the rocks the next.

500
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,312
But it's what you do when that

501
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,730
storm comes that makes you a

502
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:17,231
man.

503
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,816
So shout, do your worst, for I

504
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:19,400
shall do mine, and the fates

505
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,277
will know you as a man."

506
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:21,485
>> Yeah.

507
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,027
>> I remember that scene.

508
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,070
That scene was awesome, too.

509
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,322
We'll say that every time we go

510
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,408
to a challenge.

511
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,036
(laughter)

512
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,579
>> Yeah, we have different

513
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,121
strategies, my friend, but I

514
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,164
assure you, the result is the

515
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,165
same.

516
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,792
>> Yes.

517
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:37,167
(thunder rumbles)

518
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,752
>> What's going on?

519
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:39,503
Yeah, what's the situation out

520
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:39,962
here?

521
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,006
(indistinct conversation)

522
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:42,965
>> We have tons of coconuts,

523
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,466
tons of crabs.

524
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,092
So we go crabbing and snails.

525
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,135
>> We should light a fire before

526
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,011
that, or...?

527
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:47,928
>> Yeah, light a fire, get one

528
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,014
going, and then go fishing and

529
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:50,514
catch some hermit crabs.

530
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,182
>> You want to have Anthony just

531
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,601
get the fire going and we'll go

532
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,184
fishing or...?

533
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,227
>> Yeah. If you don't mind,

534
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:55,811
Anthony?

535
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:56,270
>> Is that cool?

536
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,104
>> All right, let's do it.

537
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,105
>> Hey, let's all grab some wood

538
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:58,981
on the way back, though.

539
00:14:59,064 --> 00:14:59,690
>> All right.

540
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,026

everybody's life, in high

want to call it.

00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,331
>> So we'll use that line.

570
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,374
I think that's the thinnest

571
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:58,582
line.

572
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,084
I'm gonna use these two.

573
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,586
>> Yeah, there's two more...

574
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,963
>> This switch threw a couple

575
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,049
of roadblocks into my million,

576
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,509
but this game is full of

577
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:08,801
roadblocks.

578
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,010
I was counting my million.

579
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,137
(laughs)

580
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,722
I had it tight, my plan was

581
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,933
tight, but it's changed.

582
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:16,517
It might come full circle if

583
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,560
things work out like I want.

584
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,145
We'll see.

585
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,480
>> Hopefully, we can have some

586
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,440
fish, potatoes and rice for

587
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,316
breakfast.

588
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,192
Is that a nice, big, energetic

589
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,819
breakfast with some coffee?

590
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,821
>> Uh-huh.

591
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,280
>> There's three old Moto and,

592
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,240
uh, three old Ravu on the new

593
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,076
Team Moto that I started.

594
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,328
And I know that makes Boo a

595
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:36,912
little nervous.

596
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:38,664
So I know the game is really

597
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:39,665
beginning.

598
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,041
They're gonna try to get a swing

599
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,669
vote... from somebody.

600
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:44,712
But everything is gonna have to

601
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,297
go through me. Everything.

602
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,591
My plan was always to have your

603
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,802
friends close and your enemies

604
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,887
closer.

605
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,738
>> Earl.

606
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,155
>> Delivery service.

607
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:14,074
>> (laughs): It's not much.

608
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,242
I got you guys a little shot

609
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,120
each.

610
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,246
>> Thank you, ma'am.

611
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,458
>> You're welcome.

612
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,792
(sighs): Ah.

613
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,794
>> Wow, coffee!

614
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,879
>> This place is definitely

615
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,047
positive for me than the last

616
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:28,964
camp.

617
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:29,548
I felt, as far as alliances, I

618
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,300
was on the out.

619
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,635
I like Earl a lot.

620
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,304
I like, um, Yau-Man a lot.

621
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,680
You know, I'm a free agent right

622
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:37,139
now.

623
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,599
I'm really just gonna try to see

624
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,893
how the cards fold over the next

625
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:41,268
couple of days.

626
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,395
>> Cassandra, do you think Boo

627
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,188
feels nervous?

628
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,981
>> Oh, very. He had a lot of

629
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:47,232
allies on the other team.

630
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,359
>> It's a different chemistry

631
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,694
and dynamic now, so...

632
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:51,528
>> Mm-hmm.

633
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,071
>> You could be a swing vote.

634
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:53,530
>> I know.

635
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,948
>> You could change everything.

636
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:55,741
>> Oh, I know.

637
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:56,909
>> And Boo could be gone.

638
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:57,826
>> I know.

639
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,744
>> Just like that.

640
00:17:58,827 --> 00:17:59,912
>> I know.

641
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:00,829
>> Just like that.

642
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,873
>> Mm-hmm. (laughs)

643
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:03,415
>> A word or two here and

644
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,250
there in the right situation,

645
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,543
you paint the picture the right

646
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,294
way, she could be right on my

647
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,880
side.

648
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,006
Appreciate you bringing the

649
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:11,632
coffee.

650
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:12,216
>> Sure, sure.

651
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,760
You guys keep fishing.

652
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,053
>> Yeah, we're trying to do

653
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:16,804
<i>something.</i>

654
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:17,179
>> (laughs)

655
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,847
>> It'd be nice to have a little

656
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,475
meat.

657
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:24,853
I have Yau-Man, I have Michelle.

658
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,356
They're all about the team.

659
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,024
All you need is that one vote,

660
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:29,608
and then who has all the power

661
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,986
then?

662
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,404
That would be me.

663
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,167
>> I got my work cut out for me.

664
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,378
'Cause right now I guess I've

665
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,587
replaced Yau-Man as the fire

666
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,382
tender and the water tender.

667
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,884
And right now I feel pretty

668
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:56,927
alone.

669
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:57,386
I got nobody to trust.

670
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,303
I have absolutely no one to

671
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,348
trust over here.

672
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,349
And... I got to see if I can

673
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,101
change that.

674
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,269
But unfortunately, I'm left back

675
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,645
here at the homestead to tend

676
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,439
the fires, while... the big men

677
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,816
go off and Cookie's still here

678
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,569
at the campfire.

679
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,322
>> Look at this, man.

680
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:17,739
Look at all these...

681
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,575
Hey, Rocky, come here.

682
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,325
>> What's that?

683
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,326
>> Look at all these crabs.

684
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,369
>> I'll hold the stick up here

685
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,621
and I'll shove 'em off.

686
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:25,998
>> That's your shell, buddy.

687
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,250
>> Ooh!

688
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,168
>> He's right there.

689
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,003
>> Oh, oh, oh!

690
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,129
>> He's right here.

691
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,088
He's right here.

692
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:33,380
Step on him.

693
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,257
>> You like that, don't you,

694
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:35,465
crab?

695
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,259
>> Hey, hey, hey.

696
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,469
>> I mean, what I felt these

697
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,972
guys needed-- um, Anthony, Rocky

698
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,557
and Mookie-- they just needed a

699
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,224
kick-start.

700
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,893
Now, food notwithstanding, these

701
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:46,476
are men that I think are true

702
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,228
competitors, and if I was losing

703
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,564
every single time, I mean, I

704
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:51,815
mean, that would definitely do

705
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:52,941
something to my psyche.

706
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:53,609
>> Wait, so how is Anthony

707
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,359
holding up?

708
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:54,818
Is he doing all right?

709
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,361
>> He's doing all right.

710
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,404
>> I'm not gonna say...

711
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,697
He looked a little flustered at

712
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,324
some of those challenges.

713
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,409
>> Uh, he's a little effeminate.

714
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,660
You know?

715
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,037
>> There's nothing wrong with

716
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,662
that.

717
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,080
>> No, no, I'm not saying that

718
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,040
anything's wrong with it, it's

719
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,416
just, you know... sometimes it's

720
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,293
hard for him to carry his own

721
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,753
weight.

722
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,004
>> Who-who... If y'all had three

723
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,047
people going to merge, who would

724
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:15,756
it have been?

725
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:16,965
>> I mean... all strategy

726
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:17,549
changes, you know what I mean?

727
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,301
>> Yeah. It's crazy now.

728
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:23,013
Everything is crazy now.

729
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,723
>> There's a lot of crab...

730
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:25,724
Coming into this, it's

731
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:26,350
three-three.

732
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,476
Majority rules always in

733
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,185
<i>Survivor.</i>

734
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,811
So I knew that I needed to bring

735
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,395
in one person from the other

736
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,563
tribe.

737
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,648
Rocky, I don't know very well,

738
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,024
but I know he doesn't get along

739
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,233
with Dreamz, and I know he's

740
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:35,859
sort of a volatile personality.

741
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,861
Anthony does not strike me as a

742
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:38,862
particularly strong player in

743
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:39,404
this game.

744
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,906
And Mookie and I had clicked

745
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,282
before, and I knew it would be

746
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,450
in Mookie's best interest to

747
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,535
join up with us.

748
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,462
>> But, oh, a huge fish.

749
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,172
Right there, right there, Mook.

750
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,258
Mook, look at it!

751
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,471
>> Got him.

752
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,264
>> You got him.

753
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,307
>> Oh, a huge fish!

754
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,433
Yeah, baby!

755
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,518
>> Oh, we gonna feast, baby!

756
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,565
Oh, yeah!

757
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,819
How is this?

758
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:01,361
>> Can we eat this guy?

759
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,070
He's so ugly.

760
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,321
>> Yeah, but we gonna eat him.

761
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:03,655
>> He's ugly.

762
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,116
>> Ugly.

763
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:06,491
>> (laughing)

764
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,493
>> How can we eat this?

765
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,494
We got the big boy.

766
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:09,745
>> Yeah!

767
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,330
>> Oh, yeah!

768
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,123
Yeah!

769
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:13,915
>> Oh, yeah!

770
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:14,541
>> We did it.

771
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,502
>> Whoo!

772
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,588
>> (clamoring)

773
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,882
>> I'll be honest, I-I was

774
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:22,507
pretty upset that we were going

775
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,218
back here again to nothing, but,

776
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,928
um, to get a fish?

777
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:27,596
I mean, that just does so much

778
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,806
psychologically and mentally.

779
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,600
Now you know you can get fish.

780
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,977
Now you know you can get food.

781
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,771
And these guys, they came from

782
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,023
Moto, are really positive and

783
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,900
they brought life, new life to

784
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:40,567
Ravu.

785
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,234
>> Who's happy?

786
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:41,443
>> Wow!

787
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,569
Wow!

788
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:43,153
>> It's like your first time,

789
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:43,820
isn't it?

790
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:44,196
>> That's right.

791
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,697
>> They caught five fish in less

792
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:46,656
than two hours.

793
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,244
Big, huge fish, with teeth.

794
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,496
It's over.

795
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:53,789
It is over.

796
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,540
The bad times are about to go.

797
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,541
I think we're going to do big

798
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,209
things.

799
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,418
I think we're going to, I think

800
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,336
we're going to rock.

801
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:02,214
>> That's for sure, man.

802
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:02,798
>> Ravu!

803
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:03,507
>> Ravu, baby!

804
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,551
>> Right now, on paper, we're a

805
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:06,843
superpower.

806
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,512
A superpower.

807
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,388
I said it again.

808
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,474
We look good.

809
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:31,576
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

810
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,160
You guys ready to get to your

811
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:32,786
first challenge as new tribes?

812
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,121
>> Yeah.

813
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:34,704
>> Yeah.

814
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:35,288
>> Yeah, let's do it, baby.

815
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,414
>> PROBST: First things first.

816
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,500
Michelle.

817
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,007
Once again, immunity is back up

818
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,008
for grabs.

819
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,635
Today's challenge is going to

820
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,679
test how effectively you

821
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,013
communicate with your new

822
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,056
tribe mates.

823
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,225
Each tribe will be belted in to

824
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:58,979
a large, six-point, sliding hub.

825
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,939
By shifting, sliding and

826
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,774
adjusting each other, you're

827
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:03,817
going to maneuver through a

828
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,651
field of bamboo poles.

829
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,279
As you go, you must pass

830
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:10,282
through five gates.

831
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,616
Making things more difficult,

832
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,618
the tribe paths intersect, which

833
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,871
means the two tribes could and

834
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,290
probably will collide before you

835
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:19,624
reach the finish line.

836
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,126
The first tribe to get all

837
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:21,751
their members across the finish

838
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,503
line wins immunity.

839
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,505
Guaranteed at least one more

840
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,464
day in this game.

841
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,466
Losers, Tribal Council tonight.

842
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,676
Somebody<i> will</i> be voted out.

843
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:30,677
Everything clear?

844
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,303
>> Yup.

845
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,053
>> Yes.

846
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:32,721
>> PROBST: Give you a minute to

847
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,806
strategize, we'll get started.

848
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,560
Here we go.

849
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,686
It is the new Moto taking on

850
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,938
the new Ravu.

851
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:42,689
For immunity.

852
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:45,609
Survivors ready?

853
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,819
Go!

854
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,487
This challenge is all about

855
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,865
communicating, how well you

856
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,074
work together.

857
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:53,617
>> Okay, y'all slide.

858
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,159
>> Wait, wait.

859
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,285
>> Go slide, slide.

860
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:55,994
Go slide, slide.

861
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:56,870

through their first gate.

863
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,081
Ravu has cleared their first

864
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:00,832
gate.

865
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:04,502
>> Okay, move forward, Ed.

866
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:05,086
This way.

867
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,087
>> PROBST: Michelle getting

00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,548

hub.

870
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,927
A bit of a standstill.

871
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,346
Moto gonna let Ravu have this.

872
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,096
>> Climb on, quick.

873
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,972
>> Twist.

874
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:16,890
Start to twist.

875
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:17,432
>> Move back.

876
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:18,516
>> Watch out, watch out!

877
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,018
>> All right, come on.

878
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,186
>> That way, that way, that way.

879
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,520
>> Move up, move up, move up.

880
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,230
>> Both of them, man.

881
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,064
>> Go through.

882
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,523

00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:44,728
>> Run.

949
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:45,353
>> PROBST: Now Moto's free to

950
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,521
move on.

951
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:47,689
>> Mookie, Mookie, back up.

952
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,191
>> PROBST: After a big impasse,

953
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,776
this challenge is back on.

954
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,986
>> And pull, and pull, and pull.

955
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,738
>> PROBST: Both tribes at their

956
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:55,613
fourth gate.

957
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,157
>> Back up, back up.

958
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,534
>> Right here, right here!

959
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:00,201
In the ring.

960
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:00,827
>> PROBST: Moto is through

961
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:01,202
their fourth gate.

962
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:01,828
>> We're through!

963
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,955
>> Come forward, come forward,

964
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:04,289
come forward.

965
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,166
>> PROBST: Ravu now through

966
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,334
their fourth gate.

967
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,376
We are neck and neck with one

968
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,586
gate left!

969
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:10,378
>> No, under it.

970
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,629
>> No, under it!

971
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,173
>> Go!

972
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,550
PROBST: Michelle, blocking Ravu.

973
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:16,885
Moto trying to steal the lead.

974
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,595
>> Go back!

975
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,221
No, the other way, the other

976
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:20,889
way.

977
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,223
Push, push through.

978
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:22,849
Now get on the outside.

979
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,809
Go, go, go, go.

980
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,771
Yau, come in, Yau.

981
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:28,813
>> PROBST: Dreamz now the one

982
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,607
stuck in the middle.

983
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,858
>> Pull!

984
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,069
(all shouting)

985
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:34,652
>> Hold up!

986
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:35,528
Aw!

987
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:36,321
>> PROBST: The challenge has

988
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,822
become very physical.

989
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:38,907
Nobody wants to go home tonight.

990
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,992
>> Get that pole.

991
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,243
>> Come on, baby!

992
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,370
>> PROBST: You are going to

993
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,955
have to work this out.

994
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,419
A major roadblock.

995
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,880
We are dead even.

996
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:56,716
>> Ow!

997
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,386
>> Come on, take it, man!

998
00:27:59,469 --> 00:27:59,928
>> Okay, let me in.

999
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,013
Okay.

1000
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:02,806
>> PROBST: They've worked it

1001
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:03,598
out.

1002
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:04,099
Ravu now back on the move.

1003
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:04,849
Moto on the move.

1004
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,227
>> Other side, other side!

1005
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,144
>> PROBST: Ravu at their fifth

1006
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,187
gate.

1007
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,022
Both tribes trying to maneuver

1008
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,357
through a very narrow

1009
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,858
passageway on that fifth gate.

1010
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,736
>> You can go through, Alex.

1011
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,780
>> PROBST: Ravu jammed up.

1012
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:19,739
Moto with a chance to catch up.

1013
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,742
>> Back up!

1014
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,244
>> Come through.

1015
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,286
>> PROBST: Moto making a little

1016
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,579
progress.

1017
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:27,831
>> Go!

1018
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:28,415
>> PROBST: Ravu making some

1019
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:29,749
progress.

1020
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:30,667
>> Come through.

1021
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,084
Let him go first.

1022
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,377
>> PROBST: Yau-Man is through.

1023
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,211
Boo is through. Michelle is

1024
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:33,795
through.

1025
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,131
Earl is through.

1026
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,132
Cassandra the last member to

1027
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:37,799
get through the fifth gate.

1028
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:38,800
Moto has cleared their fifth

1029
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,343
gate.

1030
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,594
They're heading per the finish.

1031
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:41,845
>> Go, go.

1032
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,471
>> PROBST: Ravu has cleared

1033
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:43,847
their fifth gate.

1034
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,391
They're heading for the finish.

1035
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,642
We're neck and neck as we go to

1036
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:49,227
the finish.

1037
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,812
Stacy is across the line for

1038
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,147
Moto.

1039
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,440
Everybody's got to be across

1040
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:54,357
the finish line.

1041
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,859
>> Come on!

1042
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:58,528
>> PROBST: Alex now across for

1043
00:28:58,611 --> 00:28:58,862
Ravu.

1044
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:02,115
It's going to be very close!

1045
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,534
Moto closer.

1046
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,077
>> Turn, turn!

1047
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,288
>> Get back, get back!

1048
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,957
>> Go!

1049
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,085
>> PROBST: Moto wins immunity!

1050
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:14,836
>> Whoo!

1051
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,921
>> Yeah!

1052
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:20,341
>> That's the way to hold it

1053
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,385
together, team.

1054
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:23,219
>> Way to be strong.

1055
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,305
Way to be strong.

1056
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:28,558
>> PROBST: Moto...

1057
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:29,476
congratulations.

1058
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,269
As a tribe, still Moto is

1059
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,479
undefeated.

1060
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,397
You are safe tonight.

1061
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,649
Ravu, great effort.

1062
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,193
Unfortunately, same result.

1063
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,569
Ravu still winless.

1064
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:40,820
Tribal Council tonight.

1065
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:41,779
One of the six of you is going

1066
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:41,988
home.

1067
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:42,822
Grab your stuff, head back to

1068
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,908
camp, see you at Tribal.

1069
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,627
>> I got strength now to carry

1070
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,712
the flag.

1071
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:11,351
>> So we lost the challenge

1072
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,520
again.

1073
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,313
And now old Cookie has been

1074
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,648
left by the fire to tend the

1075
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:17,690
fire and make the water while

1076
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,651
the boys go out hunting and

1077
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,736
fishing.

1078
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,280
So I'm a little bit in panic

1079
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,033
mode right now.

1080
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,576
Cinderella, a black, male

1081
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:28,910
Cinderella.

1082
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,912
What kind of whacked-out stuff

1083
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:31,704
is that?

1084
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:32,455
Can I go fishing with the boys?

1085
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,832
No.

1086
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:35,750
You can't tell underneath this

1087
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,502
calm demeanor, but right now

1088
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,878
Anthony is a turmoil of waves

1089
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,089
and emotions and worried sick

1090
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,048
that he's getting voted out

1091
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:42,840
tonight.

1092
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,926
>> Like I said, bro, we made it

1093
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,678
this far.

1094
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,680
I don't know how.

1095
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,431
I'm serious, guys.

1096
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,349
Like, I like him.

1097
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,183
He's a good kid.

1098
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,601
You know, he's not a bad guy.

1099
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,520
But, like...

1100
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,860
So you gotta go backwards

1101
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:03,319
before you go forward

1102
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,863
sometimes, buddy.

1103
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,949
Philosophy in the ocean today.

1104
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,076
>> I can tell you now if they

1105
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:10,952
bring up a name, it's probably

1106
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,996
going to be me.

1107
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,879
>> Anthony talked to me today.

1108
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:22,463
He wanted me to tell him if it

1109
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,215
is him or not, which I don't

1110
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,425
know if I'm going to do that

1111
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,384
either because I pretty much

1112
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,719
know that it's either going to

1113
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,721
be him or Rocky, so...

1114
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,514
I think Rocky should go because

1115
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,974
he's so emotionally driven and

1116
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:33,224
he's lazy.

1117
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,726
He don't do nothing around the

1118
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:35,476
camp.

1119
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,060
Anthony makes the water, you

1120
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,730
know; he keeps the fire going.

1121
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,732
But Anthony being weaker than

1122
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,443
Rocky in challenges is

1123
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,777
probably going to have a lot of

1124
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,196
effect on the rest of the team.

1125
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,297
>> You know, Rocky's got a lot

1126
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,923
of emotion.

1127
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:06,424
He's got a lot of heart.

1128
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:09,093
Sometimes he blows up, man.

1129
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:12,055
>> You are right about that.

1130
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,182
>> And I can tell you that

1131
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,934
caused a whole lot of headache.

1132
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,020
>> I see.

1133
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,149
>> Mook, help me with this real

1134
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:23,358
quick.

1135
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,026
So I don't... I don't put out

1136
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,111
the fire.

1137
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:29,822
>> Ow!

1138
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,158
I just burned my foot!

1139
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:32,450
>> Come on!

1140
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,493
>> Chill out.

1141
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:34,285
>> See what I'm saying, Mook.

1142
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,536
That's why I wanted you to help

1143
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,622
me out, bro.

1144
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,053
>> Anthony!

1145
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,097
>> Rocky has a few screws loose

1146
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,099
in his head.

1147
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,017
>> Yeah!

1148
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,352
Huh!

1149
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:00,853
It's over!

1150
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:01,979
>> He yells at people and tells

1151
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:02,397
people what to do.

1152
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,022
I noticed that since I got in

1153
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,065
here.

1154
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,066
>> Anthony!

1155
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,026
Which is the drinking water?

1156
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,778
>> I mean, Anthony is his

1157
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:09,404
little bitch.

1158
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,113
"Anthony, make the water.

1159
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,615
Anthony, put the fire."

1160
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:13,700
>> Put another log on the fire

1161
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:14,951
there, Anthony?

1162
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,036
>> I see myself really far

1163
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,330
from, from being friends, or

1164
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:19,747
liking Rocky a lot.

1165
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,499
>> Oh, this food thing...

1166
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,333
I might have to eat my

1167
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,292
portion of bread and cheese,

1168
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,168
bro.

1169
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,712
>> And I wouldn't want him

1170
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:26,838
making the merger because all he

1171
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,589
would cause is a lot of turmoil

1172
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,300
and you know, a mess.

1173
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,510
>> So I don't know, man.

1174
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:33,136
I talked to Alex, and he told

1175
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,178
me he didn't know who he was

1176
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,389
going to vote for yet because

1177
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,558
of the...

1178
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:39,100
Of the Rocky situation.

1179
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,018
>> The thing is, Rocky's really

1180
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,186
bold though.

1181
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,771
Rocky's really bold.

1182
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:44,105
>> But, uh...

1183
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,857
>> Watch out, man.

1184
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,858
>> I'm going to break something.

1185
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,276
>> Just a bit harsh...

1186
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,277
>> No, I mean, I'll tell you the

1187
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,945
truth, man.

1188
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:52,155
My vote right now, it will be

1189
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,615
50-50 right now between and you

1190
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,658
Rocky.

1191
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:56,242
So, but I mean, this is...

1192
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,201
That's my decision, man, and

1193
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,120
it's not going to change until

1194
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,329
we get there, so...

1195
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,415
>> It's all good.

1196
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,808
>> Am I going to miss Anthony

1197
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:21,559
when he's gone?

1198
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:22,602
We had a couple of good times,

1199
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:24,896
you know, when we started like

1200
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:25,229
not really...

1201
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:28,191
Not really, no.

1202
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,358
If he had a drop of social

1203
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,860
skills, it might-- it might

1204
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,737
make this decision hard.

1205
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,197
But he hasn't had any since day

1206
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:34,947
one.

1207
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,949
Anthony, where is the flint?

1208
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:37,950
And then when he tries to,

1209
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:38,534
like, finagle his way through

1210
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,203
things, he has to go

1211
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,162
like, go around-- no offense--

1212
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,288
like a girl.

1213
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,289
Like a little female.

1214
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:46,042
( whining ) Whining and trying

1215
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,585
to work on your sympathy.

1216
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:48,836
You know what I mean?

1217
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,922
It doesn't work.

1218
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,860
>> PROBST: Edgardo, tell me your

1219
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,237
first impressions when you got

1220
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,571
to Ravu Beach and saw your new

1221
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:16,781
home.

1222
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,115
>> I thought it was going to be

1223
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,742
a worse place, you know, no

1224
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,577
crabs, no anything.

1225
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,079
So I was like, you know, for 15

1226
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,580
days it wasn't even really,

1227
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,498
like you know, trying to

1228
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,165
survive, so in my mind I was

1229
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,668
like now I'm going to actually

1230
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,920
start playing<i> Survivor.</i>

1231
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:31,796
>> PROBST: Mookie, tell me

1232
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:32,588
about today.

1233
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,756
After you're done talking

1234
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,549
about the challenge, you got

1235
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,050
to get back to life, right?

1236
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:36,884
>> Yeah, we got back from the

1237
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:37,844
challenge, and right away we're

1238
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,804
hungry, so Dreamz and Rocky,

1239
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,180
Edgardo, Alex and I go out

1240
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,808
fishing over on some other part.

1241
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:44,392
Anthony is working the fire,

1242
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,269
boiling some water, filling up

1243
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,520
the canteens.

1244
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:48,771
Everyone is doing everything,

1245
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:49,313
you know, so it's... it's

1246
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,356
pretty good.

1247
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,441
>> PROBST: So, Anthony, does it

1248
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,526
concern you at all that with

1249
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,986
Tribal Council looming, the

1250
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,404
entire tribe is somewhere else,

1251
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,115
and you're boiling water?

1252
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,116
>> You know, I'm not going to

1253
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:00,616
lie.

1254
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,409
I was concerned.

1255
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,535
I mean, you don't know what

1256
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:03,286
everybody else is saying

1257
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,245
because you're isolated, but

1258
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,538
you do what you get assigned to

1259
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:06,622
do.

1260
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,498
>> To be honest with you,

1261
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:08,583
Anthony, this is the best

1262
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,333
advice I can give you.

1263
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:09,917
Put your cards on the table.

1264
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,210
If you're upset the way you're

1265
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,087
getting treated, you got to put

1266
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:13,588
your foot down and say,

1267
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,172
"Hey, guy, you know, I don't

1268
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:15,590
mind doing the fire.

1269
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,009
I need help real quick and

1270
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:18,509
then do what you want."

1271
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,343
Let people know what's going

1272
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,262
through your mind.

1273
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,221
Because if you don't tell them,

1274
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,389
how are they going to know?

1275
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:24,098
You know what I mean?

1276
00:36:24,181 --> 00:36:24,765
No one's a mind reader.

1277
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:25,641
At least I'm not.

1278
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:26,642
I don't know about you boys.

1279
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,435
So maybe if you take some of

1280
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,227
those words and you can use

1281
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,437
them later on in your life or

1282
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,564
tomorrow or the next day or ten

1283
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:32,982
minutes from now, whenever you

1284
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:35,568
want to, you know what I mean?

1285
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:36,861
>> PROBST: Anthony, pretty

1286
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,237
candid advice, and still,

1287
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,239
you're just sitting there.

1288
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,408
What is so hard for you about

1289
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,368
speaking up and owning your own

1290
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,329
space?

1291
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,371
>> You know, I tried to own my

1292
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,497
space early on, and, you know

1293
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,582
what, I got... I got knocked

1294
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:50,249
back.

1295
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,626
>> You can't give up, bro.

1296
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,668
You can't give up.

1297
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:53,294
>> Who says I gave up?

1298
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:53,878
>> You get knocked back, you

1299
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:54,503
stand up and take another knock

1300
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,297
in the mouth.

1301
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:56,797
You can't back down from

1302
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,507
nobody at any point in time in

1303
00:36:58,591 --> 00:36:59,800
your life 'cause you won't get

1304
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:00,301
respect.

1305
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,093
That's the problem.

1306
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,011
>> Rock, let me tell you...

1307
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:02,637
>> I'm trying to help you out.

1308
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,262
I'm giving a life lesson here,

1309
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,597
buddy.

1310
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,389
>> I'm going to tell you the

1311
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,265
truth-- the only person that I

1312
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,143
really have not felt I've gotten

1313
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:10,478
any respect from has really been

1314
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:10,645
you.

1315
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,063
>> No, guy, you got to

1316
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:12,980
respect... first you got to

1317
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:13,773
comfortable...

1318
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,565
>> I do respect myself.

1319
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,149
>> You have to be comfortable

1320
00:37:15,232 --> 00:37:15,983
in your own skin.

1321
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:16,692
You're not.

1322
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:17,443
You can't sit up here and tell

1323
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:18,861
these people how you feel or

1324
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,488
back at camp or anything like

1325
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:20,655
that.

1326
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,198
You have poor social skills.

1327
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,366
>> Oh, I got poor social skills?

1328
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:23,866
>> You have poor social

1329
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,284
skills, bro, yes!

1330
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,494
>> Dude, Please, please, please,

1331
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,286
Rocky.

1332
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:27,912
>> I'm not going to debate with

1333
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:28,537
you.

1334
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,121
I'm trying to help you out.

1335
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,206
>> Do you know anything about

1336
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:30,539
me?

1337
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,290
>> No, because you don't tell

1338
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,124
me nothing, bro.

1339
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,125
>> Have you asked?

1340
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:33,793
Have you asked me?

1341
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:34,710
>> Please don't raise your

1342
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:35,920
voice in my ear.

1343
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,254
No, guy, here's the thing:

1344
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,339
I talk to people who talk to me;

1345
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:38,756
I sit down like men.

1346
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,257
>> You're talking I'm not a

1347
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,092
man again.

1348
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:41,676
>> I didn't say that.

1349
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,885
Grow a spine, bro.

1350
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,011
>> You've done it before, Rocky.

1351
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,346
>> Seriously, like a jellyfish.

1352
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,098
Toughen up.

1353
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:47,932
I don't know what's going on in

1354
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,100
your mind, guy, but you act

1355
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:49,684
like a little girl sometimes,

1356
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,769
okay?

1357
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:52,561
You're effeminate.

1358
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,646
>> Oh, I'm effeminate.

1359
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:54,563
>> Extremely effeminate, yes.

1360
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,773
>> I'm sorry, please.

1361
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,108
>> Toughen up, toughen up.

1362
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:57,858
>> No, no, no.

1363
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:58,192
>> Toughen up.

1364
00:37:58,275 --> 00:37:59,193
>> This is why I don't say

1365
00:37:59,277 --> 00:37:59,652
anything.

1366
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:00,069
>> Keep going, man!

1367
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,612
Fight for what's yours!

1368
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,738
Take the skirt off a little

1369
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,573
bit; let's go!

1370
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:07,159
>> PROBST: Alex, why were your

1371
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,327
hands buried in your head.

1372
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,453
Why is this bad?

1373
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,037
>> You know, I was thinking to

1374
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,789
myself, wow, that is some tough

1375
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,165
love.

1376
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,375
I feel bad because I think what

1377
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:14,875
he said might have hurt

1378
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,544
Anthony's feelings.

1379
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,670
To be honest, that would hurt

1380
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,255
my feelings.

1381
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,881
So I just felt bad for the guy.

1382
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:21,882
And that's... all I felt was

1383
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,676
empathy, that's it.

1384
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:24,427
>> PROBST: Anthony, Rocky could

1385
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,679
easily just kiss your ass and

1386
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,055
say you're a good guy,

1387
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,056
Anthony, don't worry about it,

1388
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,599
and write your name down.

1389
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,393
What are you feeling right now?

1390
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,520
>> I appreciate all of the

1391
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:35,396
advice about standing up for

1392
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:35,646
myself.

1393
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,523
What I don't appreciate is the

1394
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:38,858
name-calling.

1395
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:39,692
>> PROBST: Do you want to be in

1396
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:40,943
this game?

1397
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:41,652
>> Yes, I want to be in this

1398
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:41,861
game!

1399
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,195
You know why I want to be in

1400
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:43,863
this game?

1401
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:44,989
Because I worked for so much.

1402
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,073
I've popped myself, hurt myself

1403
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:46,490
in these challenges.

1404
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,367
I held back from myself for

1405
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,578
giving people of myself, I held

1406
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,413
back from giving Rock of myself.

1407
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:52,955
You know why I haven't said

1408
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:53,998
anything?

1409
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:54,540
'Cause I want to make sure

1410
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:57,335
that the team works so we can

1411
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:58,252
win a freaking challenge.

1412
00:38:58,335 --> 00:38:59,295
I was trying to keep people

1413
00:38:59,378 --> 00:38:59,920
cool, keep people calm, keep

1414
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:00,546
people happy, but you know what,

1415
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,131
screw that.

1416
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:02,757
If it means I have to piss

1417
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,758
people off to stay here, which

1418
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:04,842
doesn't make any friggin' sense

1419
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,510
to me, then fine, so be it.

1420
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,553
But I'm here, all right?

1421
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:08,429
I'll be brutally honest with

1422
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,430
people.

1423
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:09,889
But I need to be here.

1424
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,390
I deserve to be here.

1425
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:11,640
I want it.

1426
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,184
And if you guys want it, you

1427
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:13,893
need it, you want to keep me

1428
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:14,477
here because I'll help you get

1429
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,436
there.

1430
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,480
Oh, I'll help you get there.

1431
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:23,360
>> PROBST: Okay, it is time to

1432
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,111
vote.

1433
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,197
Mookie, you're up.

1434
00:39:34,371 --> 00:39:35,915
>> I was getting respect back

1435
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,708
before you got... man.

1436
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,502
And, uh... watch your mouth.

1437
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,679
>> It's time to go.

1438
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,389
I don't know, I hope you can

1439
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,808
take this experience and learn

1440
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,184
from it, and I think you'll be

1441
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:56,560
all right if you can do that.

1442
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:59,188
Have a good one, buddy.

1443
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,155
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1444
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,241
votes.

1445
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,458
Okay, once the votes are read,

1446
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,626
the decision is final.

1447
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:21,460
The person voted out will be

1448
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,002
asked to leave the Tribal

1449
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,546
Council area immediately.

1450
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,965
I'll read the votes.

1451
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,177
First vote: Rocky.

1452
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,263
>> Huh.

1453
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,391
>> PROBST: Anthony.

1454
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,308
One vote Rocky,

1455
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:39,311
one vote Anthony.

1456
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,188
Anthony.

1457
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,274
Two votes Anthony.

1458
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,070
Anthony.

1459
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,321
That's three votes Anthony.

1460
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,407
One vote Rocky.

1461
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:54,994
Sixth person voted out of

<i>Survivor: Fiji:</i> Anthony.

1463
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:58,664
That's four; that's enough.

1464
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:01,333
You need to bring me your torch.

1465
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:09,592
Anthony, the tribe has spoken.

1466
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,430
Time for you to go.

1467
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,515
>> Good luck.

1468
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,818
>> PROBST: Well, tomorrow, Lisi

1469
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,195
joins this tribe as a new

member.

1471
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,239
The job you do in welcoming her

1472
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,407
will certainly have a big

1473
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,617
impact on how well this tribe

1474
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,576
does.

1475
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:35,951
Grab your torches.

1476
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,620
Head back to camp.

1477
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,330
Good night.

1478
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:51,258

>> PROBST: Lisi joins the Ravu

1484
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:00,351
boys' club.

1485
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,352
>> Back at Moto I didn't like

1486
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:02,478
her and she didn't like me.

1487
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:03,020
So she should be worried.

1488
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:03,729
>> Bye, Yau.

1489
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:04,647

search for the hidden idol.

>> I'm always the target but if

1492
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,236
I have the immunity idol, I

1493
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,987
can go quite far.

1494
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,113
>> PROBST: And things get rough.

1495
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,199
>> Follow that ramp...

1496
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,330
>> I'm a little pissed off.

1497
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:22,122
I'm a lot pissed off.

1498
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,123
I'm mad at myself for

1499
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:23,749
apparently not screaming to the

1500
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:26,001
world, being a jerk.

1501
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:26,919
That's what you need to prove

1502
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:27,711
that you're out for a million

1503
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:28,629
dollars.

1504
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:29,213
Regardless of what Rocky says,

1505
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,464
I have great social skills.

1506
00:42:30,547 --> 00:42:31,215
I'm not what was wrong with

1507
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:31,757
that tribe.

1508
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,258
It was Mookie and James.

1509
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,676
Those are the problem with Ravu

1510
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:34,802
and that's why they're losing.

1511
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,136
They're going to continue to

1512
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:36,804
lose until both those guys are

1513
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,722
gone.
