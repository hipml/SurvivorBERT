00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,753
>> PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:06,464
<i>Survivor:</i>
At Yasur, Eliza had some

3
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,591
explaining to do.
>> How the hell did the

4
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,760
vote switch to Dolly?
>> I thought she was

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,220
writing my name down.
>> How about clueing us in,

6
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:14,931
Eliza?
>> I'm not so sure Eliza

7
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:16,766
is in with us.
Even then I don't know if I

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,102
trust her, but I've got a backup
plan.

9
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,563
>> PROBST: At Lopevi, Rory was
fed up with Sarge's military

10
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:23,690
ways.
>> Do you feel I'm not

11
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,275
pulling my weight?
>> I saw you going on a lot

12
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,277
of walks.
>> Sarge wants to dictate

13
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,740
when people take a crap, when
you sit down, when you work, and

14
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:34,117
I don't take orders real well.
>> PROBST: At Yasur, Twila and

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,829
Mia had it out over the
division of labor.

16
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:39,289
>> You take the martyr
and you play on that role!

17
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:43,585
>> You stay here five minutes
and then your ass goes down...

18
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,336
I'll whup the little scrawny
bitch's ass.

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,798
I ain't here to make no friends.
>> PROBST: At the challenge, the

20
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,635
tribes got a big surprise.
Today you are playing for both

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,097
reward and immunity.
Here's the twist.

22
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:59,100
Both tribes will vote out one
member tonight.

23
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,478
>> No!
>> PROBST: Separate Tribal

24
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,980
Councils, two people going
home.

25
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:06,149
In the first of two rounds
Lopevi won the reward.

26
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:10,320
Lopevi, congratulations.
You now have a Hawaiian sling,

27
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:14,115
fishing gear and a mask.
The men also won the

28
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,201
opportunity to play for
individual immunity while the

29
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:19,287
women sat out.
It was John K. who won the

30
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,624
necklace and a little something
extra.

31
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:28,004
John, you're now going to leave
and go back to camp with Yasur.

32
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:31,174
You'll be gathering information
for a very big decision,

33
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,010
because tonight when your
Tribal is over, you will stay

34
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,304
behind.
You will give your immunity to

35
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:39,349
one member from Yasur.
>> PROBST: At Yasur, John

36
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,310
witnessed a tribe divided.
>> You just keep saying you

37
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:45,563
don't want there to be a tie.
>> I don't trust you, Eliza.

38
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:49,025
>> Don't trust me.
>> I could care a less who gets

39
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:51,194
voted off of this tribe.
I just want them to not be mad

40
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,196
at me for whoever gets voted
off.

41
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:57,033
>> PROBST: At Lopevi's Tribal
Council John K. reunited with

42
00:01:57,116 --> 00:02:00,245
his tribe, and even though Rory
got three votes the alliance of

43
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:04,999
elders held and J.P. was voted
out.

44
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:09,212
J.P., the tribe has spoken.
John K. stayed behind for

45
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,673
Yasur's Tribal Council.
You know who you're giving it

46
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,716
to?
>> Yeah.

47
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,552
>> PROBST: Give it up.
And in an attempt to

48
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,345
not ruffle any feathers John
gave immunity to Ami who was

49
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:21,182
not in danger of being voted
out.

50
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,185
When it came time to vote it
was Lisa who betrayed the young

51
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:28,398
girl's alliance by helping to
vote out Mia.

52
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:35,238
Mia, the tribe has spoken.
14 are left.

53
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:39,242
Who will be voted out tonight?

CBS PARAMOUNT
NETWORK TELEVISION

55
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,279
>> You talk about telling
the truth.

56
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,364
>> I told you that.
>> That was before I thought

57
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,367
that there was somebody who was
going to flip.

58
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,661
I'm sorry I ever
apologized almost.

59
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,789
>> I'm sorry you took it
that way and that's how it is.

60
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:12,168
It is what it is.
>> The vote at Tribal Council

61
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:15,672
shocked the hell out of me.
Lisa was supposedly in an

62
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:20,468
alliance with me, Julie and Mia,
so when she voted against Mia,

63
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:25,890
that totally blindsided me and
I was like, "That bitch."

64
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,184
>> You know what, honest
the truth, I didn't trust you,

65
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:30,979
so there you go.
Really, it all comes down to

66
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,439
you, Eliza.
It all comes down to you.

67
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,901
>> The night before, I had
voted for Dolly behind Lisa's

68
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,988
back and then I apologized,
apologized, apologized.

69
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,949
Finally, she forgave me and then
she did the exact same thing.

70
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,368
That makes you seem like kind of
a hypocrite.

71
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,536
>> You know what, I had
a right and I changed my mind.

72
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,163
I'm not going to be
confrontational.

73
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,456
I did what I did and I'm not
going to argue with you.

74
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,334
I told you I didn't trust you
and I meant it.

75
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,502
I've been giving the truth all
along.

76
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:58,172
>> Except today.
>> You have the nerve.

77
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,259
You have your nerve.
>> You know what, guys?

78
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,386
My environment is a little
polluted here.

79
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,429
I'm going to go to bed.
I love all of you and I'll

80
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,389
talk to you tomorrow.
>> I just want us all to

81
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:10,935
become a strong team.
If we want to beat these guys,

82
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,022
we need to be tough and we need
strong inner and outer.

83
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,524
I don't know how to get there,
but we need to get there and

84
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,152
I'm going to sleep because I'm
tired.

85
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,654
>> I wasn't surprised
about Eliza or Julie getting mad

86
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:26,409
at me, but I voted for who I
felt like I needed to vote for

87
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,412
last night, so let them get mad.
I would much rather be in an

88
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:33,583
alliance with the older group.
>> Guys, I'm going to have to

89
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,252
switch with somebody.
>> I'm furious.

90
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,963
I do not trust Lisa, not one
bit.

91
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:42,050
I'm going to be civil to her and
and pretend to be unified

92
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,594
because that's what everybody
wants, but if she were gone

93
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:50,349
tomorrow I would be thrilled.
She repulses me now.

94
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,492
>> That was hairy for me
last night, getting three votes.

95
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,953
>> It's a gut check.
>> Getting those three votes.

96
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:15,458
I took three votes last
night in Tribal Council, and

97
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:20,088
yet that doesn't really bother
me a whole lot.

98
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,590
>> Our five strong is
invincible.

99
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,801
We need to stay the course and
we have no worries.

100
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,511
It's all about the numbers,
baby.

101
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,721
>> The fact of the matter
is, I've got an agreement with

102
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:33,476
Chad, Travis, Sarge and Chris.
That's already a numbers game

103
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:43,861
that works for me.
>> I can't stand the

104
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,281
way that this tribe ended up.
The good young guys that have

105
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,618
great personalities and are
good athletes are all gone.

106
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:54,956
Why are we letting fat dudes
run the show?

107
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,499
This doesn't make any sense to
me.

108
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,669
I don't know what these guys
are doing.

109
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,753
>> Yeah.
Setting us up for losing

110
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:05,216
challenges and such.
>> I don't blame Rory for doing

111
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,677
it, but Bubba and Chad.
>> Just because it's easy

112
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,347
and a sure thing.
It's an easy numbers game right

113
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,515
now.
They don't have to think very

114
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:16,352
far down the road.
I don't know why they think

115
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:18,563
their plan will work.
None of them are very athletic,

116
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,691
and the bottom line is a lot of
these challenges are physical

117
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:33,244
so we'll see what happens.
>> The fab five, as long

118
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,371
as they got their five, which
they have had since day one

119
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:36,706
there's not much left up in the
air.

120
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:41,502
The only thing I can physically
do myself I think is the

121
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:45,715
fishing.
If I can endear myself enough

122
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:49,093
with the fishing, that may
change one or two people's

123
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,929
minds.
Wish me luck.

124
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,557
>> Good luck.
>> Good luck.

125
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,906
Got one already.
>> Yeah.

126
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:15,995
I got him.
Give it a chance to grow up.

127
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,459
>> I got little fish and
its brother littler.

128
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,461
The seem like the only fish
dumb enough to get hit by the

129
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:27,506
spear are the small ones.
>> Good job, brother!

130
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,927
I wouldn't shoot something
that small because that

131
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,096
wouldn't even fill one person.
>> You know what if they

132
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,767
are offering themselves up to
me, we can at least throw them

133
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,810
in there.
John and I, it's getting

134
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:44,065
down to the nitty-gritty.
Hopefully we'll figure out a

135
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:47,109
way to shake up the game and
change the dynamics of what's

136
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,821
going on right now because
something's got to happen.

137
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:03,292
>> Tree mail.
>> Oh, my God, look.

138
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:07,421
Oh... oh, my God.
"So you think you're living

139
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,132
like the natives, but are they
as hungry or as cold?"

140
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,635
>> "Frustrated by your
lack of food, your shivering

141
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,012
must get old."
>> "Well, put your minds

142
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,306
together and maybe you'll
discover...."

143
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,851
>> "Help is on the way,
and you'll find it under cover."

144
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,312
>> Pig.
>> Pig roast.

145
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:27,149
>> Shell... piggie.
>> It's a memory thing.

146
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,068
>> I am so friggin' good at
this.

147
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,946
>> Really?
>> I think we have a lot

148
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,323
better memory than the men do.
>> Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

149
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,867
>> There's a rainbow.
>> Oh, my God!

150
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:41,122
>> Yay, that means we're
going to win.

151
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:54,302
>> PROBST: So catch me up.
Yasur, how is life at camp?

152
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:58,514
>> Peaceful, good
relations, nice rest.

153
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:00,349
>> PROBST: Scout, how could life
be better?

154
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,809
>> If we knew a little
bit more about finding food and

155
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:05,146
making something different, that
would be great.

156
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,732
>> PROBST: Lopevi, what's going
on with your camp?

157
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,817
>> Once we finally got
that spear, just spent a lot of

158
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,154
time out in the water and taking
a lot of shots you eventually

159
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,739
hit some fish.
Most of them are, you know, a

160
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,741
bite or two, but I'm getting
better at it.

161
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:19,994
We're going to have more fish.
>> PROBST: Okay.

162
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,038
Shall we get to today's
challenge?

163
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,040
>> Mm-hmm.
>> Let's do it.

164
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,792
>> PROBST: It's for reward and
it's a very simple memory test.

165
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,087
There are 15 pairs of items
covered in the field.

166
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,049
Your goal, pair up matching
items, one tribe member at a

167
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,218
time.
First tribe to pair up five

168
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:40,389
matching items wins reward.
Want to know what you're

169
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,058
playing for?
>> Yeah.

170
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,102
>> All right.
>> PROBST:<i> Da, mith.</i>

171
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,983
>> All right.
We're going to learn something.

172
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,236
>> PROBST: This is Da.
Da's from the Amberian tribe.

173
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,406
He's going to spend the next 24
hours with the winners of this

174
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,409
challenge.
Put it simply, Da is a rock star

175
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,204
when it comes to living on the
island.

176
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,789
He doesn't speak a lot of
English.

177
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,750
You're going to have to draw
information out of him, but he

178
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,878
knows how to find food, how to
catch food and how to cook food.

179
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,880
He knows how to better your
shelter, how to improve overall

180
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,883
your living situation.
You've only been out here nine

181
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:19,220
days, you still have 30 days
left if you make it all the

182
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,597
way.
This could completely change

183
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,932
the way you live from here on
out.

184
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,226
Worth playing for?
>> Yeah.

185
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,644
>> Sure.
>> PROBST: All right.

186
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,563
Take your spots.
Wait for my go.

187
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,068
Okay, Lopevi won the right to go
first.

188
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:42,368
Chad, you're up.
Wooden pig.

189
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:50,918
Tamtam.
>> Tamtam.

190
00:11:51,001 --> 00:12:01,345
>> PROBST: Lisa.
Shrimp trap.

191
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,764
>> PROBST: It's a guess at this
point.

192
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,475
Coconut.
Four items revealed.

193
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,646
No matches.
Rory.

194
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:13,315
Starting to get to know the lay
of the land.

195
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:19,321
Tribal drum.
Still no matching items.

196
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:23,325
Wooden idol, not to be confused
with the tamtam.

197
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:30,166
>> Scout, you're up.
>> PROBST: It's a gourd.

198
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,835
And a nautilus shell.
Not a match.

199
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,172
Somebody is going to match up
soon.

200
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:40,134
Bubba, feeling lucky?
Grapefruit.

201
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,386
Bubba is thinking about one
thing.

202
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,472
>> Eating it.
(laughs)

203
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,349
>> PROBST: Looking for another
grapefruit.

204
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,519
>> Oh, there you go.
>> PROBST: Tribal drum.

205
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,979
The first item that could be
matched up.

206
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:56,025
Ami, ready to go match up the
drums.

207
00:12:56,108 --> 00:13:03,574
Ami has the first tribal drum.
Ami has a match.

208
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:09,163
First match for Yasur.
One pair for Yasur.

209
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:15,377
Lopevi you're up.
Brady reveals a palm frond.

210
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:19,089
Not too excited by the palm
frond.

211
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,926
>> All right.
Got it.

212
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,179
>> PROBST: The other grapefruit.
Second item could be matched

213
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:28,724
up.
Eliza pulls off the first

214
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:32,520
grapefruit and the second
grapefruit.

215
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:36,190
Yasur with another match.
They are up 2-0.

216
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,359
>> Nice grapefruits.
>> PROBST: Yasur with two

217
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:41,195
matching pairs, Lopevi with
none.

218
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,699
Chris, pig jaw.
Is he going to go back to

219
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,202
something familiar or something
new?

220
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,454
>> Shrimp trap.
Lopevi reveals another

221
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,040
potential match.
Julie, looking for matching

222
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:56,919
shrimp traps.
Julie has the first shrimp

223
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,214
trap.
She has to remember where the

224
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:04,385
last one was.
Chris just revealed it.

225
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,429
And she has it.

226
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:13,477

227
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,105
Oh, yeah.
He stumbled on to something,

228
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,400
the pig jaw.
The other pig jaw has been

229
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,944
revealed.
Can John remember where it

230
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:29,577
sits?
Nope, the wooden pig.

231
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,372
That's the second wooden pig.
Leann.

232
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:42,631
She has the first pig jaw.
Another match for Yasur.

233
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:46,969
They lead 4-zip.
They are one pair away.

234
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:51,307
Sarge, getting his first shot
at the course, wasting no time,

235
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:57,980
goes back to the wooden pig and
Lopevi has their first match.

236
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:01,817
They are finally on the board.
That's 4-1.

237
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,986
Yasur needs just one more match
to win it.

238
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,281
>> Oh, yes!
>> PROBST: Coconut.

239
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:10,242
Where's the other coconut?
We've seen it.

240
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,499
Nope.
Not a match.

241
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,043
After four in a row Yasur
misses.

242
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:26,634
Guys, still alive.
There's the first coconut and

243
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,510
he did it.
Lopevi back in it.

244
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:32,348
4-2.
Lisa, Yasur with their second

245

need to match up one more pair,

246
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:40,356
and they win the services of
Da.

247
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:44,693
There's the nautilus shell.
Lisa stumbled upon the nautilus

248
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,153
shell.
Can she remember where the

249
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:49,073
other one is?
She's seem very confident with

250
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:54,620
her skip.
There it is.

251
00:15:54,703 --> 00:16:03,504
Yasur wins reward.
>> You are just the girl to

252
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:06,757
bring it home.
Good job.

253
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,052
>> PROBST: Lopevi.
I got nothing for you.

254
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,888
No reward.
Heading back to camp.

255
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:15,391
>> Good job, Yasur.
>> Thanks.

256
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,394
>> Good job, ladies.
>> PROBST: Yasur, you want to

257
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,021
meet Da?
>> Yes!

258
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,191
>> PROBST: Da, come on in.
>> Hey.

259
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:27,611
>> Hello, Da.
>> PROBST: You guys have won the

260
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,030
chance to benefit from the
knowledge of a native tribesman

261
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,907
for 24 hours.
>> All right.

262
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,576
>> PROBST: You guys head back to
camp.

263
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:44,628
He has his own way of getting
there.

264
00:16:44,712 --> 00:17:01,228
He has his own way of getting
there.

265
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,147
He'll meet you there.
>> You guys, I see him coming.

266
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,108
Should we be on the beach to
welcome him?

267
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,194
I'm so excited.
>> At the challenge today we won

268
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:14,241
an island expert for 24 hours.
His name is Da, and he's

269
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,201
supposed to know everything
about these islands, how to

270
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:20,289
hunt, fish, cook, shelter,
anything we need to know, he's

271
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:24,251
supposed to know it so we want
to learn from him, busy when

272
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:29,256
he's gone, that's it.
>> Hello.

273
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:39,767
>><i> Hola.</i>
>> Da, came up on the

274
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,686
beach, we all came to greet him.
We were going to stop and

275
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,273
introduce ourselves.
No time for that.

276
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:54,323
He came in here with a purpose.
>> Oh, my God.

277
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,168
>> Hurry.
>> Wow.

278
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:10,172
>> Good.
>> That would take us about a

279
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:19,223
half an hour.
>> (speaking native language)

280
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:25,395
half an hour.
>> (speaking native language)

281
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,232
>> Watch how he does that.
Holy Toledo.

282
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:32,402
>> It was right there.
>> Da, he like pulled up

283
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,823
a root and he's like, have you
been eating this?

284
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:39,243
We're like no, and he chops it,
and he's like, here you go.

285
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:42,871
>> Keep an eye on him and
he just keeps walking and we

286
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,040
were just chasing to keep up to
him.

287
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,209
>> Cut it off?
Cook 'em and eat 'em.

288
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,212
>> Yeah.
>> Who knew we had all

289
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,339
this food in our backyard and we
thought it was all gone.

290
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:57,177
We just didn't know what to
eat.

291
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,222
>> There's something else.
>> It looks like bamboo.

292
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:05,727
>> In between the long
cornstalks.

293
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:11,233
>> Sugar cane.
Sugar.

294
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,402
>> We've got sugar cane,
which is just unbelievable.

295
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:17,948
That's everybody's favorite.
>> That's the best thing ever.

296
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,534
>> What is that?
>> Eat.

297
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:29,293
>> Nut.
>> Da seemed to understand us

298
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,754
more than we could understand
him.

299
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,090
He had to kind of use his hands
a lot.

300
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:38,260
Eventually we got it.
>> Face is right there.

301
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:45,434
>> Eyes, nose.
>> Look at that.

302
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:49,271
All right.
>> Da, he's just amazing.

303
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,441
We're all in awe, I mean just
watching... taking in the

304
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:56,445
knowledge that he's giving us
and he's cooking us a great

305
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,281
dinner.
It's a godsend, it's a blessing,

306
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:05,287
it really is.
>> Da was like a big breath

307
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,081
of fresh air.
He really took our focus off

308
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:12,085
each other and focused more on
what's going on around us.

309
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,296
I definitely feel more confident
that I can find food by myself,

310
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:18,467
I could cook it by myself and
I think he really boosted team

311
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:23,555
morale that we all have that
confidence and that's huge.

312
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,318
>> Bubba getting tired
of plantains.

313
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,321
>> Yeah.
>> I bet old Da could have told

314
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,531
a few more things to eat.
>> I bet they will

315
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:45,369
have a hell of a meal tonight.
>> Today's reward

316
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:48,330
challenge would have really been
fabulous because every creature

317
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,333
comfort we could have come up
with could have been at our

318
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:56,505
fingertips right there.
>> I'm fixing to go

319
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,632
through withdrawal.
>> What?

320
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,842
>> Food.
>> Camp morale at this

321
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,136
point is low.
Bubba for one is not liking this

322
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,389
day-to-day plantain thing, he's
just not into it and it's

323
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:11,478
really affecting his mood.
>> I'm going to start

324
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:17,442
carving my wife's and children's
name on my pole.

325
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:22,364
I'm from the country.
Every meal was a celebration.

326
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,367
You know, you eat with your
family.

327
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:33,208
My biggest concern is how my
family is doing.

328
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:43,218
You know, are they missing Dad?
You know they are, but my boys

329
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:51,518
are my life.
They are everything.

330
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,571
>> I'm worried about Trav.
>> The thing is, he'll

331
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,407
just let his thoughts get the
best of him, you know?

332
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,745
>> It's becoming obvious
that Bubba's weakness is

333
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,663
definitely his family.
I'm just telling you

334
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:15,459
personally it's going to really
affect you physically if you

335
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:19,755
don't put that ... behind you.
It's a weakness, man.

336
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,591
People start to question
whether or not you're tripping.

337
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:26,595
That's going to affect people's
perceptions of you.

338
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,430
>> Like I'm trying to be
a loner.

339
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:32,601
All right, hey, appreciate it.
>> Okay.

340
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,479
>> The thing with Rory
is, a lot of times I think he's

341
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,606
really misunderstood.
>> Whoa, man, we don't want

342
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:41,151
dirt all over it.
>> There was already dirt

343
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:43,570
all over it.
>> Everybody's got

344
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,448
strong personalities here and
Rory is no exception.

345
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,283
>> Man, don't use clean
water cleaning our food.

346
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:51,620
>> Sarge, you are so
difficult to keep happy, man.

347
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,790
>> With Sarge and Rory,
it's just an ongoing barrage of

348
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,500
bickering.
>> All the canteens have to

349
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,627
be done in a line, too.
>> Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

350
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,630
>> Whether it's this
filling the canteens full of

351
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,590
water, how much wood to put on
the fire, how to cook something,

352
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:06,802
it's a lot of bickering and I'm
tired of it.

353
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,804
>> You could have handed it
to me.

354
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,764
>> There's always rocks on it.
>> Okay, okay, okay.

355
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:11,640
>> Damn.
>> I'm just saying, you

356
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,643
don't have to throw at me
like a bone.

357
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,937
>> All right, play
nicely or you're both going to

358
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,814
time out.
Right now we just need

359
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,274
harmony on the team and today
that definitely wasn't

360
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:33,203
happening.
>> Right now Da is making

361
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:38,667
our beds comfortable.
>> The man took bamboo and kept

362
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,461
chopping and chopping and
chopping and then split it open

363
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:45,006
and flattened it out and all
those humpity-bumpity bumps we

364
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,510
had in the bed-- they're gone.
>> It's like a mattress.

365
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:54,641
This is going to be so good.
Thank you.

366
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:57,185
Okay.
Fishing.

367
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,021
>> Fishing?
>> Fishing.

368
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:08,321
>> Okay.
>> That night, Da made

369
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,699
torches out of dry palmetto,
lit them up and we took off down

370
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:17,664
the beach crab hunting.
He was good to do anything that

371
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:20,709
we asked and I thought it was
just extremely gracious of him.

372
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:25,839
>> (speaking native language)
>> Not a good night to try?

373
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:28,717
There were no crabs.
He said the tide needed to be

374
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,554
further out, but to find ways
that we can learn from each

375
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:36,391
other and speak to each other
and cross cultures, it was

376
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,894
touching to have an example of
that happening in this exotic

377
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:42,731
place.
>> It was a good day.

378
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,733
I think a lot of feelings were
healed, and I think our tribe

379
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:48,737
kind of came back together.
It was just a very wonderful

380
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:55,118
day for everybody.
>> What did he get?

381
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:59,080
>> It looks like a crab.
>> Oh, wow, a crab.

382
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:03,251
>> Thanks, Da.
This is wonderful.

383
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,254
Having Da here was
absolutely incredible, and I

384
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,882
was surprised how emotionally
attached we all got to Da just

385
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,718
within 24 hours.
We were all like, you know,

386
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,720
practically crying when he
left.

387
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:23,772
>> Thanks, Da.
>> Bye.

388
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:39,287
>> Thanks, Da.
>> Bye.

389
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,582
>> Bye, Da.
>> That was a great

390
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,293
>> This was the best reward
we could have won.

391
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,255
It was a morale booster, and,
oh, my God, it couldn't have

392
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:51,007
come at a better time, because
next time we have to go to

393
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:56,888
challenge we'll be ready in a
big way.

394
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:15,490
>> I have absolutely no idea how
to use a Hawaiian sling.

395
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:20,662
I know the concept, but I don't
have any aim, any direction,

396
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,373
but it's the first day.
We'll see how it goes.

397
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:26,001
>> You going fishing?
>> Yeah.

398
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:31,214
>> Just be really careful
you don't break a point.

399
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:36,803
Rory took the spear and just
milled around for hours today.

400
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:39,848
I've been trying to figure out
a way for the last few days

401
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,851
here for a little bit of a
rift between Sarge and Rory.

402
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,520
I think it's doable because I
think the Sarge gets put off by

403
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:48,273
him a little bit, too.
Look at that.

404
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:51,192
He takes off with the spear so
he can walk around and have fun

405
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,820
poking through the reef.
>> Looking for sea shells

406
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,864
for his little kids?
>> That's not helping

407
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,159
get us dinner at all.
He's never going to put any

408
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:02,329
fish in this fire.
It's never going to happen.

409
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:06,082
I was maybe a little bit
sharper with the tongue today.

410
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:09,419
I was trying to just shake
things up just a little bit and

411
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:13,006
figure out if there's any room
to go one way or the other.

412
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,883
Who do you think is going to
consider Rory a threat?

413
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:18,553
>> Nobody.
>> Exactly.

414
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:21,348
So who is going to vote against
Rory?

415
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,391
Nobody.
He's not going to have anybody

416
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,768
vote against him so who do you
think is going to be there in

417
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:28,396
the end?
I planted my seed.

418
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,564
I did what I thought I could
do.

419
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,483
I think our efforts should be
on doing better as a tribe and

420
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,069
winning.
Maybe if we start strengthening

421
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:37,781
our tribe instead of making it
weaker, things will improve.

422
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:44,662
>> Tree mail.
>> Cool.

423
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:48,083
>> "Many hands make light
work, so the saying goes.

424
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,919
Fail to put your minds together
and add to your tribe's woes.

425
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:55,382
In a test of mental agility,
it's anybody's game.

426
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,884
Tribal Council for the losers,
one more will lose their flame."

427
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:02,097
>> Put your minds together.
>> We need to win this

428
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,932
immunity because Julie and I are
the only two people left who

429
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:07,602
voted the opposite way of the
majority at the last Tribal

430
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:10,605
Council so we both feel very
vulnerable and feel like this

431
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:19,656
win is essential.
>> PROBST: Come on in!

432
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,458
All right, Let's get to today's
challenge.

433
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,127
We're at an interesting point
in the game.

434
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,338
We're still even, seven members
each in a game that is all

435
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,632
about numbers.
This is what guarantees you the

436
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:38,925
numbers.
Let me explain the challenge.

437
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:42,971
Both tribes are going to solve
a tile puzzle.

438
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:47,517
There are four Vanuatu symbols,
each symbol in four different

439
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,647
colors for a total of 16 tiles.
Arrange the tiles so that none

440
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,941
of the same symbols, none of
the same colors are in the same

441
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:58,987
row or same column.
You'll select up person to be

442
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,448
your eyes.
They will have a vantage point

443
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:02,991
above on a tower.
First tribe to complete the

444
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,619
puzzle correctly wins immunity.
Losers going to Tribal Council

445
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,497
tonight.
Yasur, who is going to be your

446
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,666
set of eyes?
Eliza.

447
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:13,042
Lopevi, who is going to be your
set of eyes?

448
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:16,838
>> Rory.
>> PROBST: Rory.

449
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:20,675
All right, take your spots.
Wait for my go.

450
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:26,681
Here we go, guys, for immunity.
Survivors ready.

451
00:29:26,764 --> 00:29:28,391
Go.
>> Start flipping, start

452
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,518
flipping.
>> PROBST: First thing you've

453
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,188
got to do is find out what
you're dealing with.

454
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,732
Four different symbols,
each symbol comes in four

455
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,067
different colors.
Cannot have the same symbol or

456
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:42,030
the same color in any row or any
column.

457
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,698
>> Don't start moving them
around quite yet.

458
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:45,033
>> Don't move them
around quite yet.

459
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:48,703
Just flip 'em over.
>> Leave that one there, Sarge.

460
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:52,665
Chad, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny,
get the brown pig and take it up

461
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,043
to the brown skull.
Let's get the colors

462
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,170
straightened up first.
>> Leave it there, Sarge.

463
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:58,713
>> Okay.
>> Twila, start switching

464
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:01,841
this and those.
These two in the second column.

465
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:04,677
Switch those two.
No, no, no.

466
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,971
Julie, switch the one in front
of you and the one you're on.

467
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,057
>> PROBST: There is a key to
figuring this out.

468
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:13,019
>> Chad, bring the pig
down here where the brown palm

469
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:16,231
tree is.
>> Okay.

470
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:19,067
>> The red, the brown, okay.
Are there any colors that are in

471
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,069
the same column or the same
row.

472
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,905
>> No, no, let's work on
symbols.

473
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:24,948
>> Now all we need to do
is work on the symbols.

474
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:28,576
>> All right.
>> We got it.

475
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,747
>> So I need a blue volcano.
>> Move that down to the pig.

476
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:36,584
>> Switch like colors, right?
>> Work with your light colors.

477
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:41,631
>> Okay, than that right here.
>> That with the brown.

478
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:44,592
>> No, no, no, no.
Chris, don't...

479
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,762
>> PROBST: You guys need to work
together.

480
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:49,472
You're never going to solve
this.

481
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,432
>> Listen, listen.
Okay, Leann, come here.

482
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,811
We need a diagonal of the same
color all the way across and a

483
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,146
diagonal of every opposite shape
all the way across.

484
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:03,945
The pigs were all in a diagonal.
>> Diagonal is this way.

485
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:07,115
>> We need a same color.
>> You guys got to start

486
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,451
working here, guys.
>> Don't stand on the symbols.

487
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,995
>> Look, knucklehead, geez.
>> Look, guys, guys.

488
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:15,248
>> Listen to Rory.
>> Guys, guys, guys!

489
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,584
>> PROBST: Rory may have lost
control of this.

490
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,002
>> What if we did this
one diagonal, too?

491
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:23,673
>> Scout, exactly what
Scout just said.

492
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,925
Perfect.
>> PROBST: Yasur working

493
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,135
together well.
>> Check it out.

494
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:30,138
We need a blue palm tree, blue
palm tree right here.

495
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,432
>> I need a volcano.
Orange volcano.

496
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:33,975
You're trying to do is one at a
time.

497
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:38,104
>> Go with a red pig.
>> Orange volcano right here.

498
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,981
>> You've got two skulls,.
>> I know, man.

499
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:43,443
We're not done yet.
>> PROBST: Lopevi, total chaos.

500
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:46,654
>> No, no, do what she is
saying, switch 'em back.

501
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,531
Let's do what she's saying.
She's got the eyes.

502
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,991
>> Okay, girls, now
where's the yellow skull?

503
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,952
Okay.
Yellow skull, brown skull,

504
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,996
switch it, switch it, switch it.
>> Put it there. We got it.

505
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,165
>> PROBST: Eliza thinks she's on
to something.

506
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,500
>> I think we got it.
>> Make sure.

507
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,209
Check every one.
>> Two volcanoes in the

508
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,670
same row.
>> Okay, okay, okay.

509
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,714
>> And two skulls in the
same row?

510
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,924
Can we switch them?
We ought to switch these two.

511
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,510
>> Take the black skull
and put it where the black

512
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,013
volcano is.
>> Hey, guys, hear me out.

513
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:15,558
>> I think we got it, Jeff.
>> PROBST: Lopevi, hold up.

514
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:29,280
Yasur wins immunity.
Their second challenge in a row.

515
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:40,500
Yasur, congratulations.
No Tribal Council tonight.

516
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,877
Guaranteed at least one more
day out here.

517
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,212
Lopevi, never good to go to
Tribal Council.

518
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,715
Somebody is going home tonight.
You have the afternoon to

519
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,760
figure out who that is going to
be.

520
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:54,430
Go back to camp and see you at
Tribal.

521
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,917
>> The challenge today for
immunity was pretty much

522
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,211
pandemonium.
It was a mess.

523
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:28,089
We didn't even come close.
>> There was just people

524
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:31,551
screaming orders, and it was
just a cluster.

525
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,594
>> And we all had our plan,
but we said Rory would do the

526
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,430
talking and that's what messed
us up.

527
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,265
I mean right off the bat, I seen
a way to do it, but I didn't

528
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,267
want to interfere with Rory.
>> Most of us were

529
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,436
sitting around most of the time,
not saying anything, waiting for

530
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,231
direction.
>> It was the worst

531
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:49,444
performance as a team unit that
we've had and I pretty much take

532
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,280
that on my shoulders.
>> It didn't really

533
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,490
matter who was on the podium.
We had people screaming orders

534
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,451
and nobody was listening to
nobody.

535
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,577
>> There's a lot of yelling
going on.

536
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,120
If you looked up, Rory just
sitting looking with a blank

537
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,457
stare like he couldn't figure
it out.

538
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,251
>> So is the reason
Rory still in because he's not

539
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:08,963
seen as a threat.
>> No. He's supposed to

540
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,133
be real good at puzzles.
>> He didn't do better

541
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,469
than anyone else today.
>> I know.

542
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,972
Maybe he just had a bad day.
What if they vote for Brady

543
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,308
tonight.
Would you vote that way?

544
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,311
Maybe it will show people
that you're willing to work

545
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,312
with us.
You see what I'm saying?

546
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:27,815
>> The way I look at
it, bro, what does your group

547
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,276
have to offer that's going to
beat those girls?

548
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,487
Me and Brady are more athletic
than anyone here.

549
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,322
You really think you guys
are going to win some immunity

550
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,325
challenges?
>> Let me ask you something.

551
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:41,829
This little alliance we have
going on, who do you think is

552
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:47,502
the leader?
>> You. Sarge?

553
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:52,131
>> He's called every shot.
>> Man, I hope the five of

554
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:56,844
us really are together because
if not I'm dead right now.

555
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,180
If anybody turned around
in our alliance and went

556
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,350
against me it would be Sarge,
and it really scares the hell

557
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,352
out of me.
Sarge just likes to dictate

558
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,979
what goes on.
I don't know if you've noticed

559
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,565
that or not.
>> Yeah, I've noticed.

560
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:12,360
It's hard to miss.
Within our alliance we do

561
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:16,364
have some conflict.
Sarge could at the last second

562
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:20,034
make a change.
Sarge does like to be in

563
00:35:20,117 --> 00:35:25,039
control.
>> Pull yourself up.

564
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:28,376
If Brady gets voted out, okay,
I'm going to lose a real good

565
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,920
work partner.
There you go, get up there,

566
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:33,381
get up there. There you go.
I would keep him here to the

567
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,509
end because he's one of the
strongest.

568
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:39,345
Don't let that son of a
bitch win.

569
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:43,391
My background tells me have
the strongest warriors with you

570
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,893
when you go to a battle.
There you go, all right, all

571
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,229
right.
The pack wants Brady gone

572
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:51,399
but Rory is a bad seed and you
don't need bad seeds on a team

573
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:54,735
when you're fighting for
survival.

574
00:35:54,819 --> 00:36:04,829
Hey, we'll see what happens.
>> PROBST: Welcome to Tribal

575
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:20,428
Hey, we'll see what happens.
>> PROBST: Welcome to Tribal

576
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,097
Council.
Before we get to the vote let's

577
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,600
talk about today's challenge.
Rory, you got zero respect

578
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,393
today.
How does it make you feel?

579
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:31,230
Every Tribal we've come to,
you've gotten votes.

580
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:35,276
Then today you're leading the
tribe, which is odd to me, and

581
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,237
then even weirder, nobody
listens.

582
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:41,449
>> I am the leading vote-
getter at this point, Jeff, and

583
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,785
I'm scared as hell right now, as
a matter of fact.

584
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,830
>> PROBST: The last two days
have seen a huge shift in

585
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,458
momentum, with the women clearly
in control.

586
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,628
They win the reward challenge
improve their camp life

587
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,838
dramatically.
They win the immunity challenge

588
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,633
today and force you guys to
vote out yet another member.

589
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,468
Bubba, can you guys sense that
shift happening?

590
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:04,555
>> Yeah, Jeff, they really
kicked us in the groin today.

591
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,850
We really took it hard, but the
thing of it is I really think

592
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:11,437
that we're going to be a whole
new ball team come next game, I

593
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,106
really do, Jeff, I really
believe that.

594
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,943
>> PROBST: Based on what I'm
looking at, I don't buy it at

595
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,444
all.
Brady, do you think it's

596
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:21,530
possible that you guys started
playing an individual game way

597
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,824
too soon?
>> I think at the very,

598
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,495
very beginning, day one, maybe
even hour one, individuals

599
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,539
started thinking about where
they were going to be six, eight

600
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:35,378
challenges down the road, and I
think that mindset took apart a

601
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,881
lot of our team concept right
from the very beginning.

602
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,800
>> PROBST: Chris, the obvious
problem with playing an

603
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:43,678
individual game you is may last
longer than the guy next to you,

604
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,888
but you're not going to last
longer than the women.

605
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,807
>> Yeah, but you don't
necessarily know where the women

606
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,642
are coming from.
You don't necessarily know if

607
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,019
the women are going to be
playing numbers or how are the

608
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,855
women playing?
We don't know how they are

609
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,691
playing.
>> PROBST: What on Earth would

610
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,567
make you think they're going
to do anything but stick

611
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,527
together?
>> There's nothing that

612
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,530
makes me think they wouldn't
stick together.

613
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,865
But I'm just saying, look,
you're a team at first, you're a

614
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,159
tribe, you have to no choice,
but the bottom line is looking

615
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:11,163
ahead individually, you've got
to make sure you do what's right

616
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,708
for you.
I mean, anything can happen.

617
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,710
>> PROBST: Chad, as Chris was
saying that, you were shaking

618
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,545
your head in agreement.
>> If things within the

619
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,714
tribe starts happening where
there's a sense that people are

620
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,425
starting to go individual, what
are you going to do as an

621
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:25,219
individual if you feel that that
is starting to happen, you have

622
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:27,930
to jump on.
Ideally the tribe will come

623
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:30,975
first, but this individual thing
has to be your backup plan.

624
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,560
It's the only way to save your
own butt.

625
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,730
>> PROBST: John, are you
concerned tonight you might be

626
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,606
going home?
>> I'm extremely worried.

627
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,401
The past two guys that were
voted out were two of the more

628
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,570
athletic guys in our group so,
yeah, I'm scared.

629
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,572
I mean, There's not much more I
can do.

630
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,324
I'm not going to back down and
pretend I'm not a good athlete.

631
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,869
>> PROBST: Brady, why are you
voting the way you're voting

632
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,871
tonight?
>> I'm voting first and

633
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,707
foremost to make sure our team
doesn't lag behind the other

634
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,543
team.
I want this team to stop that

635
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:00,087
momentum slide, turn it around
and go into the merge with some

636
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,505
momentum, that's the way I'm
voting.

637
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,884
>> PROBST: With that, it's time
to vote.

638
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:14,935
Chris, you're up.
>> Brady, you caught the

639
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:23,944
Chris, you're up.
>> Brady, you caught the

640
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:27,823
first fish, you even climbed the
pole, but the spirits sometimes

641
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:31,702
dictate that it's time for you
to go.

642
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:42,755
>> Maybe the third time's
the charm.

643
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,821
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
votes.

644
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,544
Once the votes are read the
decision is final.

645
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:24,672
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the Tribal

646
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,675
Council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.

647
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:33,973
First vote...
Brady.

648
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:38,727
Brady.
Two votes Brady.

649
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:44,650
Rory.
Two votes Brady, one vote Rory.

650
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:54,368
Three votes Brady.
The fifth person voted out of

651
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:56,745
<i>Survivor Vanuatu,</i> Brady.
That's four votes, that's

652
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:59,707
enough.
Please bring me your torch.

653
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:14,722
Brady, the tribe has spoken.
It's time for you to go.

654
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:23,689
>> Good luck, fellas.
>> PROBST: Well, based on your

655
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,608
first three Tribal Councils, it
would appear that you're voting

656
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:29,069
out tribe members that you
think might become an

657
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,238
individual threat later in the
game.

658
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,782
Only potential problem with
that strategy-- it's still early

659
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,868
in the game.
See how it plays out.

660
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:38,871
Grab your torches and go back
to camp.

661
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:59,600
Stay tuned for scenes from our
next episode.

662
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,269
Next time on<i> Survivor:</i>
>> There are people

663
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,063
coming in on a canoe.
>> Are you serious?

664
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:06,440
>> I'm dead serious.
>> PROBST: Lopevi and Yasur

665
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:08,275
face a shakeup.
All right, everybody,

666
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,778
drop your buffs.
And then...

667
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:15,282
>> Holy ...
>> Oh, my gosh.

668
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:21,789
>> Whoa!
You feel that earthquake?

>> Well, how much did that suck?
Can't help but feel like a bit

673
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:32,675
of a loser, but in the back of
my mind I'm hoping there was

674
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:35,678
one of those things where they
said Brady is one of those

675
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,805
guys that he makes it to the
merge, he's going to kick my

676
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,683
ass, so I'll take that little
bit of self-encouragement along

677
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,726
with me.
