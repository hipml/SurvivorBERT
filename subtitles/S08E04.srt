>> JEFF: Previously on<i> Survivor:</i>

2
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:06,256
>> Oh, my God!
>> JEFF: The tribes competed

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:09,467
to build the best shelter, which
led Chapera to question Rob C's

4
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,177
work ethic.
>> Where have you been?

5
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,430
>> I got lost in the jungle.
>> ROB M.: it seems like he's on

6
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,724
a never-ending coffee break.
>> ROB C.: You want to get more

7
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,058
rocks?
>> ALICIA:<i> You</i> want to get more

8
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,226
rocks.
>> ROB C.: Okay.

9
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,645
>> JEFF: At Saboga, Rupert and
Jerri clashed over Rupert's

10
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:23,773
underground shelter design.
>> JERRI: I don't feel digging

11
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:27,277
into the ground is a good idea.
>> RUPERT: I know what I can do.

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,654
I'm 40 years old.
I've built houses for 20 years.

13
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,949
>> Let's just... do it.
>> JEFF: On judgment day,

14
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:35,452
Rupert's stubbornness cost his
tribe.

15
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:39,289
You would not want to live here?
>> Oh, no.

16
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,124
>> ETHAN: I don't think he likes
it.

17
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:44,335
>> JEFF: Chapera's shelter
secured them a victory and a

18
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:48,465
bounty of comfort.
>> ROB M.: Get that wine open,

19
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,467
let's go.
>> JEFF: At the celebration,

20
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,177
Rob and Amber's alliance heated
up.

21
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,304
>> AMBER: If you're going to
kiss me, kiss me now because I'm

22
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,805
not kissing you with nasty
breath later on.

23
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:59,684
>> ROB M.: Whoa.
>> JEFF: At Mogo Mogo, Jenna

24
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:03,480
started to fade from the game.
>> JENNA: I have a lot to lose

25
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:07,484
being here, like my mom.
She's had cancer for a long time

26
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:11,488
and I'm just afraid that she
might pass away while I'm here.

27
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,656
>> JEFF: When the tribes
arrived at the immunity

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,326
challenge, Jenna made a tough
decision.

29
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,498
>> JENNA: Due to someone who's
very ill at home right now, I

30
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,625
need to pull myself out of the
game.

31
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,669
>> JEFF: This is a big action,
and it could have a big impact

32
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,173
on this game.
With Jenna's departure, Mogo

33
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,842
Mogo lost their first member.
15 are left.

34
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:37,722
Who will be voted out tonight?

Rio Pequeño.
That's the name of the camp

41
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,961
today.
>> ALICIA: I knew that it was

42
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,131
rainy season in Panama, but I
didn't realize that rainy season

43
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:38,593
meant, like, torrential
downpours that flood your whole

44
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,971
entire camp.
>> SUE: Who would have ever

45
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,849
thought?
You can actually see it flowing

46
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:49,020
through the studs of the house.
>> AMBER: We have constructed a

47
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,314
shelter that is pretty
unbelievable.

48
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,651
We used everything possible that
we got from our reward.

49
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:59,697
We put the parachute as a wall,
we have the tarp on top.

50
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:07,121
>> ROB M.: The shelter held up
pretty good.

51
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,998
The water was a little bit
excessive, though.

52
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,792
It ended up coming up through
the floor.

53
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,379
We weren't really predicting for
that to happen.

54
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:18,007
However, I slept almost all
night long, 'cause I was under

55
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,511
the blanket.
I was warm, and I just slept the

56
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:31,437
whole night.
>> AMBER: You're so warm.

57
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:42,782
>> TOM: Rob and Amber were
laying on the thing kind of

58
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:46,995
getting a romantic mood.
Maybe the rain was just an

59
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:51,708
excuse to maybe snuggle a little
closer.

60
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,086
>> ROB C.: Boston Rob and Amber
are going to do it.

61
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,714
I don't know when, but they're
going to do it.

62
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,008
They've got the mat, the
pillows.

63
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:03,720
Everything is in place, and I
really wish those two the best

64
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:13,771
of luck.
>> RUPERT: Our beach is

65
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:34,459
of luck.
>> RUPERT: Our beach is

66
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:39,255
destroyed, that stupid shelter
that I built is destroyed.

67
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:43,301
Digging into the sand is the
dumbest idea I've ever had in my

68
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,929
life.
And we paid dearly tonight for

69
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:51,059
it.
It's now underwater, and we are

70
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:56,647
homeless.
And I got to build us another

71
00:05:56,731 --> 00:06:09,410
shelter today, something today.
>> JERRI: We've been shivering

72
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:17,502
in the rain probably five or six
hours, if not more.

73
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:23,716
It's a disaster.
The rain just started pouring,

74
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,428
and the whole shelter filled up
with water.

75
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:32,975
The entire thing.
The hole that Rupert thought was

76
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,979
so brilliant to dig, filled up
with water.

77
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:42,110
This never would have happened
if they hadn't dug that hole.

78
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:52,161
(sobbing): It's not worth it.
>> RUPERT: That storm was

79
00:06:52,245 --> 00:07:18,896
(sobbing): It's not worth it.
>> RUPERT: That storm was

80
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,025
insanely hard.
It was rough this morning, it

81
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:30,032
was rough last night.
>> ETHAN: Other than the time

82
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:34,370
father passed away, I think that
was the worst night of my life.

83
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:36,205
Hands down.
It was horrible.

84
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,500
Some of us thought people were
going to come and rescue us.

85
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,877
I'm like, "They're not going to
rescue us.

86
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,879
What are you, nuts?"
I'm like, "This is<i> Survivor."</i>

87
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,382
It's our own fault this we built
a crappy old shelter.

88
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:49,427
>> JENNA L.: It's not raining at
out there.

89
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,556
Come on.
You have to start warming up.

90
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,558
I promise you it's warmer out
here.

91
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:59,729
I'm in a bathing suit.
It's dripping and wet in here.

92
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:07,737
>> JERRI: I don't have a clue
what's going on at camp, other

93
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:14,785
than disassembling our old
shelter.

94
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,914
I don't know where they plan on
moving it, or what they plan on

95
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,917
doing with it.
As far as I'm concerned, I

96
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,002
couldn't give a rat's ass at
this point.

97
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:26,881
I don't even care.
>> RUPERT: You want any?

98
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,758
>> JENNA L.: Drink some.
Come on.

99
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,261
It's good for you.
>> RUPERT: It is good for you.

100
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,598
If Jerri warms up and feels
better and soaks a little of

101
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,809
daylight in her, she'll be fine,
too.

102
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:42,438
But the plan today is, we got to
make shelter, we got to make

103
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:47,360
fire, and we got to get it
together now.

104
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,957
>> SHII ANN: Look how much it
rained.

105
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,792
>> COLBY: I'm glad we set that
out.

106
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,001
>> KATHY: Oh, good.
>> LEX: Good, good, good.

107
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,962

of those moments when you

108
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:10,341
realize Mother Nature can be one
forceful bitch.

109
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:13,636
>> KATHY: We'll have to come up
with a really good lean-to and a

110
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:17,848
way to keep an ember, you know?
>> COLBY: Yeah.

111
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,476

you're a veteran at this game

112
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,187
and living in the environment
after doing a<i> Survivor,</i> but, uh,

113
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,606
you know, we should have known
better, and we do now.

114
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,442
When we woke up, the fire was
gone, but we got our flint out,

115
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,320
and we made some, uh, fluff out
of the twine that came in our

116
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,990
Home Depot box.

121
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:51,007

124
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:13,029
fishing day.
To come back today with three,

125
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,031
you know, meat-chunked moray
eels.

126

>> Whoo!

130
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,086
>> LEX: After we cooked and
cleaned these eels, there must

131
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:33,049
have been at least five or six
pounds of meat.

132
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,092
It tastes really good.
>> KATHY: It's good.

133
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,219
>> LEX: It's grilled fish, but
really good.

134
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,888

>> RICHARD: I don't know what it

135
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,515
is, but, boy, I bring a fish in,
they're blown away by my feeding

136
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,726
them.
I mean, I could sit around and

137
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,395
do absolutely nothing, and
they're just thrilled that I'm

138
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,523
there to provide 'em fish.
It's great.

139

phenomenal job of providing us

That said, one of the reasons
I'm looking so forward to

143
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,245
getting the third key to that
rice box is that once we have

144

rice, we won't need to rely so
heavily on Richard for food.

160
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,187
eat bugs."
>> ALICIA: Oh!

161
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,482
>> ROB C.: No, I'm just kidding.
>> SUE: I could eat this whole

162
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,317
pot!
Girl, I'd eat whatever they put

163
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,486
in front of my face.
>> ROB C.: Sue, I was kidding.

164
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,447
I was kidding about that.
>> SUE: Huh?

165
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,823
>> It was a joke.
>> ROB C.: Just relax.

166
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:29,915
No sweat, this one.
>> JEFF: Come on in, guys.

167
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,007
How's everybody doing?
>> Good.

168
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,675
>> Super.
>> JEFF: Another tough storm.

169
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:43,220
Some of the worst weather we've
ever had on<i> Survivor.</i>

170
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,556
How are you guys doing, Mariano?
>> ROB M.: We're doing good.

171
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,348
>> JEFF: Shelter holding up,
Rob?

172
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,183
>> ROB M.: Yeah, so far, so
good.

173
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,143
>> JEFF: Saboga, how are you
guys doing?

174
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,854
Down a couple of members.
The rain has been awful.

175
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,857
How did the shelter hold up?
>> RUPERT: It could've weathered

176
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,358
a little better.
>> JENNA: But we all got

177
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,318
showers.
>> RUPERT: Yeah.

178
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,361
>> JEFF: What's going on with
Mogo Mogo? Lex?

179
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,822
>> LEX: Richard actually caught
three more eels: one four-foot,

180
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,575
one three-foot, and one probably
two-foot, so... it's a good

181
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,368
life.
It's really good.

182
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,578
>> KATHY: He's like King Neptune
out there.

183
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,622
>> SUE: That must be better
eel than what you caught when I

184
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,540
was with you, 'cause that was
all bone.

185
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,708
>> RICHARD: I was feeding you,
honey.

186
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,376
>> SUE: That was all bone.
>> RICHARD: That's why I gave it

187
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,377
to you.
>> SUE: 'Cause you have no bone

188
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,130
to give me, Richard.
>> RICHARD: That is absolutely

189
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,382
true, honey.
>> JEFF: Well, I'm glad you to

190
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,510
see you guys are in a good mood.
Should make for a fun challenge.

191
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:26,055
We thought for today's reward
challenge, we would give you a

192
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:29,391
chance to finally interact while
testing your memory skills.

193
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,519
Here's how it's going to work:
each tribe member will have

194
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,938
their own station.
Inside each station are four

195
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:38,025
items relating to island living.
Your goal is to find another

196
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,528
tribe member who has a matching
item.

197
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,697
Every time you get a match, you
score a point for your tribe.

198
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,075
You can match an item with
somebody from your own tribe.

199
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,118
You can match an item with
somebody from another tribe.

200
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,204
Doesn't matter.
When you find a match, you score

201
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,456
a point.
The tribe who scores the most

202
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,043
correct matches wins reward.
One more thing: you let somebody

203
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,586
peek inside your container, it's
your problem.

204
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,088
Want to know what your playing
for?

205
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,758
>> Of course.
>> JEFF: It is a<i> Survivor</i>

206
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,260
bathroom.
>> Wow!

207
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,220
>> SUE: Oh, my god!
>> ALICIA: Oh, my God, it's a

208
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,596
little john.
>> JEFF: Got a solar shower,

209
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,560
nice toilet... a little toilet
paper.

210
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,395
>> ROB C.: Toilet paper's nice.
>> JEFF: Look at this, a little

211
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,604
Scope.
>> ALL: Wow.

212
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,814
>> JEFF: How good would this be?
Some Crest and a, uh... on a

213
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:21,527
toothbrush, scrub your teeth.
Body wash. Everything you need

214
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,404
to get good and clean, smell
good again.

215
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,489
In addition, first place and
second place get another clue

216
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,784
to their lock box.
In the lock box, rice.

217
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:32,329
So that means for Mogo Mogo and
Chapera, this would be your

218
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,623
final clue, which means you
could theoretically have rice

219
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,625
tonight.
Chapera, you have to two extra

220
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,460
members.
You're sitting two people out.

221
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,545
Who's sitting out?
>> SUE: Me.

222
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,171
>> ROB C. Mom and Dad.
>> JEFF: Big Tom and Sue, you're

223
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,132
sitting out.
Mogo Mogo, you have one extra

224
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,300
member.
Who's sitting out?

225
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,801
>> COLBY: I'll sit out, Jeff.
>> JEFF: Donaldson's sitting

226
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:46,969
out.
Take a spot on the bench.

227
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,971
Everybody else, take a spot
behind one of your stations.

228
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:55,311
Wait for my go.
Okay, we randomly drew numbers

229
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,605
to decide who would go first.
Chapera won.

230
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:01,275
Mariano, you're up first.
>> ROB M.: Pretty boy.

231
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,652
>> JEFF: Who's pretty boy?
>> ROB M.: Wow, he looked right

232
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,903
at me.
Must be a sign.

233
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,322
>> JEFF: Ethan?
>> ROB M.: You got a rock in

234
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,281
there?
>> ETHAN: I think you got a

235
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,825
couple up here, don't you?
>> ROB C.: Oh, snap.

236
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:12,161
>> ETHAN: I'm sorry, my friend,
I don't.

237
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,329
>> JEFF: No match.
Richard Hatch?

238
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,456
>> RICHARD: Hey, Mariano, you
got a rock?

239
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,166
>> JEFF: That's how the game
works.

240
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,794
>> RICHARD: Thanks, bud.
>> JEFF: Nice job.

241
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,714
First match for Mogo Mogo.
Rupert?

242
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,508
>> RUPERT: You got a sponge?
>> AMBER: I do have a sponge.

243
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:30,846
>> JEFF: A match for Saboga.
Amber?

244
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:32,056
>> AMBER: Kathy, do you have a
seed?

245
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:37,853
>> KATHY: Me? By God, I do.
Damn it.

246
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:41,357
>> JEFF: Look at Amber covering
that box.

247
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,362
Chapera on the board. Kathy?
>> KATHY: Hey, Cesternino.

248
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,031
>> ROB C.: Kathy, big fan.
>> KATHY: I love you, too, even

249
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,367
though you're a snake.
Give me your shell.

250
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,204
Reach in there and get it for
me. Whoo!

251
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,373
I can just read your mind,
buddy.

252
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,209
>> ROB C. Can you read it now?
(laughter)

253
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,295
>> JEFF: Ethan?
>> ETHAN: Shii Ann, do you have

254
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,172
any coral?
>> JEFF: How are you guys doing

255
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,632
this?
>> This is unbelievable.

256
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,217
>> SHII ANN: Yes, I do.
>> KATHY: No food makes you more

257
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,468
psychic.
>> ETHAN: You've got to make

258
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,513
these boxes a little thicker.
>> JEFF: All right, Cesternino.

259
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:16,558
>> ROB C.: Lex, do you have any
coral?

260
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:21,522
>> JEFF: Unbelievable.
We're tied up, each tribe with

261
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,857
two matches. Lex?
>> LEX: Jenna, could you tickle

262
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,068
me with your feather?
>> JENNA: No.

263
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,029
>> JEFF: Finally, a real human.
>> ALICIA: Lex, do you have a

264
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,198
feather?
>> LEX: Oh...

265
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,076
>> JEFF: Another match for
Chapera.

266
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,870
>> JERRI: Rich, do you have a
coconut shell?

267
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:40,249
>> RICHARD: Hell no, but I'll
pretend I do.

268
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,626
>> JEFF: Dickie...
>> ROB M.: Dickie, give me your

269
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,003
driftwood.
>> RICHARD: I knew I lifted it

270
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,757
too high.
>> SUE: Good job, Boston Rob.

271
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,593
>> JEFF: Mariano with another
match for Chapera.

272
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,387
>> RICHARD: Rob, give me your
sea sponge.

273
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,431
>> ROB C.: You will never get my
sea sponge.

274
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:59,226
>> RUPERT: Okay, Jenna, I'll
take your rock.

275
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,145
>> ETHAN: Jenna, why don't you
just leave it open?

276
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,605
(<i> laughing</i> )
Here, leave it open and turn

277
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,482
it around.
>> JEFF: Saboga and Chapera tied

278
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,985
at four.
Mogo Mogo at two.

279
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,112
>> ROB. C: Ethan, do you have a
coconut shell?

280
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:13,115
>> ETHAN: How'd you know?
How did you know that?

281
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,159
>> TOM: Good job, Robbie.
>> JEFF: Lex?

282
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,368
>> LEX: Jenna.
>> JENNA: Lex?

283
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,578
>> LEX: How'd you feel about
giving me a little sponge bath?

284
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,497
>> JEFF: Lex, do you know that
because she left her box open?

285
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,958
>> LEX: That's right.
Aw, thank you, sweetheart.

286
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,753
Easy, easy.
>> ROB C.: I already know what

287
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:26,587
you have.
I don't need...

288
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,006
>> LEX: Oh, shut up.
You know nothing.

289
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,133
>> JEFF: Alicia?
>> ALICIA: Hey, Lex, do you have

290
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,343
a coconut husk?

00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:37,014
>> JEFF: And Lex is empty.
>> Yay!

292
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,683
>> ALICIA: You're my man.
Never forget it.

293
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,268

>> SHII ANN: Alicia.

294
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,644
>> ALICIA: Yes.
>> SHII ANN: Do you have a

295
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,479
feather?
>> ALICIA: I already gave my

296
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,481
feather.
>> RUPERT: Shii Ann, you got a

297
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,816
feather?
>> JEFF: Rupert with another

298
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,819
match for Saboga.
Chapera at six, Saboga at five,

299
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:55,157
Mogo Mogo at three. Amber.
>> AMBER: Jenna, do you have any

300
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,325
driftwood?
>> JENNA: Yes.

301
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,953
>> JEFF: Amber with another
match for Chapera. Nicely done.

302
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,206
Jenna's box is empty.
She's out of the game.

303
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,666
Amber's box is empty.
She's out of the game. Kathy?

304
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,002
>> LEX: Come on, kitty cat.
>> KATHY: Okay, Cesternino, you

305
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,379
got a rock?
>> ROB C.: I do have a rock.

306
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,340
>> JEFF: Mogo Mogo with another
match.

307

308
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:14,802

00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,183
have a shell I could have?
>> JEFF: Mogo Mogo with another

312
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,684
match.
>> JERRI: Alicia, do you have a

313
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,020
piece of coral by any chance?
>> ALICIA: No.

314
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:26,855
>> JEFF: No means yes?
>> ALICIA: No means yes in this,

315
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,649
uh, situation.
>> JERRI: Thank you.

316
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,025
>> JEFF: Jerri with a match for
Saboga.

317
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:32,653
Very tight game.
There are only three matches

318
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,571
left. Rupert?
>> RUPERT: Kathy, do you have

319
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,865
driftwood?
>> KATHY: No, really?

320
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,702
>> RUPERT: Oh, my gosh.
Thank you.

321
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,870
>> JEFF: Rupert now out of the
game.

322
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,206
Kathy now out of the game.
That leaves Boston Rob, Richard,

323
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:48,210
Alicia and Jerri.
Mariano.

324
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:52,631
>> ROB M.: Richard, please tell
me you got the sea sponge.

325
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,886
>> JEFF: A match for Chapera.
Richard's out of the game.

326
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,764
Mariano's now out of the game.
Here's where we're at Alicia.

327
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:01,723
You get this right, Chapera
wins.

328
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,686
Game over. Saboga in second.
>> ALICIA: Gotcha.

329
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:12,776
Jerri, do you have a seed?
>> JERRI: I do have a seed.

330
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,449
>> JEFF: Nicely done.
Chapera, rice tonight.

331
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,202
In addition, when you're done
with the rice, take a shower,

332
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,454
get cleaned up.
You guys can head back to camp.

333
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:29,626
Chapera, this is yours to take
back with you.

334
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:42,556
Wait, wait, wait. Smell.
(<i> cheering</i> )

335
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,142
>> ROB M.: Oh, man.
>> ROB C.: Tommy john, come on,

336
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,269
let's go.
>> ALICIA: We are going to be

337
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,979
clean.
>> ROB M.: This is a little bit

338
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,606
insane.
We had to carry everything that

339
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:54,818
we won back to our camp, and,
uh, Big Tom put the toilet over

340
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,613
his head.
I'm willing to bet it's not the

341
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,324
first time Big Tom's had his
head in the toilet.

342
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,951
>> We're taking a bath in the
ocean.

343
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:08,498
>> Oh, oh, so nice.
>> ROB C.: After 11 days out

344
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,793
here, it was nice to take a
bath.

345
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,880
(<i> groans</i> )
(<i> laughs</i> )

346
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,257
>> ROB M.: Amber and I, we're
not so sure if it's a good idea

347
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,469
if we bathed each other, because
the, uh, tribe might get the

348
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:24,139
wrong idea.
However, soap and scrubs with

349
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:26,516
the women...
>> AMBER: Let's just do this all

350
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,938
day long every day.
>> TOM: Winning the bathroom

351
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,773
products-- it boosted our
morale.

352
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,816
And the other thing about
winning the challenge is we got

353
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,861
another clue for the key that
would unlock our box for the

354
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,988
rice.
"Not in search of keys, but

355
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,492
you've all been there before.
Every day, a place for you to go

356
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,495
to find out what's in store."
>> ROB C.: Tree mail.

357
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,372
>> TOM: "Stand in front and face
it.

358
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,666
It will point the way.
"Start your count behind, and

359
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:55,504
you're just ten paces away.
"Once that's done, you will

360
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,131
surely see.
It's in a shallow grave, so dig

361
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,343
carefully."
>> ROB M.: Six, seven, eight,

362
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:08,642
nine.
It's right here. It's got to be.

363
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:13,689
A big root.
How much is a pace?

364
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:17,359
>> TOM: I think what threw us
off the most was how far is a

365
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,778
pace?
You know, my pace is different

366
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,698
than a midget's pace.
>> ROB M.: How much is a pace?

367
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:26,201
>> ROB C.: I would think it's a
step.

368
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:30,372
The search for the key turned
out more like the search for the

369
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:36,586
Holy Grail meets the opening of
Al Capone's safe.

370
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,382
>> ROB M.: I think you're going
the wrong way.

371
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:44,761
I think we got to dig this way.
>> ROB C.: You can dig that way.

372
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,931
This is my chance to be the
hero.

373
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,851
I've never been the hero before.
Before this day is over, I'm

374
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:56,523
going to dig up this whole
entire beach.

375
00:21:56,606 --> 00:22:00,610
>> ROB M.: It's in the back.
It's got to be in the back.

376
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,447
I look over, the kid's building
a friggin' sand castle on the

377
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,407
beach.
It looks like he's 12 years old.

378
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,410
You know, he's got his shovel
there, and he's just putting it

379
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,162
together.
This kid's living in, like,

380
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:13,040
la-la-land.
Right here.

381
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,542
It's got to be right here.
>> ALICIA: Fingers crossed.

382
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:20,088
>> ROB M.: I think it's deep.
I got it.

383
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:24,801
I got it!
(<i> whooping</i> )

384
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:28,555
Yeah, baby!
>> ALICIA: Shake it.

385
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,933
(<i> key rattles in bottle</i> )
>> ROB M.: We got it.

386
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,062
(<i> sighs of relief</i> )
There it is.

387
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,605
>> SUE: Oh.
>> AMBER: Is this water?

388
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,482
What is this?
>> ALICIA: You guys, that's

389
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:39,441
alcohol.
That's whiskey.

390
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,069
>> ROB C.: Oh, my god.
>> ALICIA: It's whiskey.

391
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,613
(<i> Amber yells happily</i> )
>> AMBER: We got rice!

392
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,281
>> ROB M.: We're rolling in this
game.

393
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,826
>> ALL: One, two, three, rice!
>> TOM: For us to have rice in

394
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,912
our system, it's just like gas
in the tank.

395
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,998
And I think it's going to give
us a little bit of, just that

396
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:58,251
little more hoochie.
>> ALICIA: Oh, my god.

397
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,588
I don't know how anybody's going
to stop us at this point because

398
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,424
we're so far ahead of the other
tribes now, it's insane.

399
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,301
I feel sorry for them.
Not.

400
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:16,394
(giggles)
>> RUPERT: We got some sleep

401
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:24,152
(giggles)
>> RUPERT: We got some sleep

402
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,155
last night in that new shelter.
It was nice to get a few hours

403
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:34,621
uninterrupted, relaxing sleep.
We all feel<i> at least</i> 100% better

404
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:40,919
than yesterday morning.
(<i> laughing</i> )

405
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:46,007
>> JERRI: I slept in this
morning.

406
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:51,680
I needed to.
I'm in such a better space now.

407
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:55,308
Saboga's looking up.
Rupert's out trying to get more

408
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,812
oysters and snails and trying to
catch some fish.

409
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,857
I was working on improving the
roof so that when the heavy rain

410
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,192
comes again, it'll be ready to
be waterproof.

411
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,529
Jenna got water.
We're all just trying to set up

412
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:11,366
a comfortable surrounding.
(<i> Jenna gasps</i> )

413
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:15,871
(<i> Rupert laughs</i> )
>> ETHAN: Oh, that's a nice one.

414
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,331
>> JENNA L.: So, we got fire,
shelter and a big meal, so it

415
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,875
was really redemption, sort of.
It felt really good.

416
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:23,628
>> RUPERT: You guys ready?
>> JENNA L.: That's a lot

417
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,046
of seafood.
Mm, this one's tough.

418
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,840
>> RUPERT: Yeah, they're kind of
chewy.

419
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,884
A few more shrimps.
>> JENNA L: Rupert, thank you so

420
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:29,926
much.
Ethan, thank you.

421
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,219
>> RUPERT: You're very, very
welcome.

422
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:36,933
>> JERRI: I'm already looking so
far ahead of now and that's, I

423
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:41,354
think, what's keeping me sane
'cause yesterday morning, I

424
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:45,192
about lost it after that storm.
I didn't think I was going to be

425
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:48,528
able to snap out of it.
I literally experienced a moment

426
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:52,741
where I realized how people go
mad.

427
00:24:52,824 --> 00:25:00,749
And it was scary.
>> JEFF: Come on in, guys!

428
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,967
How's everybody doing?
>> Good.

429
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,928
>> Good.
>> JEFF: You ready for today's

430
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,763
immunity challenge?
>> JENNA L.: Yes.

431
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,015
>> JEFF: For today's challenge,
we will test how well you

432
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,099
communicate within your own
tribe.

433
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,936
One person will be your eyes.
They will be the guide.

434
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,063
The other tribe members will be
blindfolded.

435
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:26,149
Using only verbal commands, the
guide will direct their tribe to

436
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,110
find 15 pieces of the puzzle
scattered out along the beach.

437
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,947
You'll bring back the pieces and
place them in your team's

438
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,949
square.
Once all the pieces are inside,

439
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,952
take off your blindfolds, start
putting the puzzle together.

440
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,621
The first two tribes to complete
their puzzle win immunity.

441
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,457
Who's going to be the guide for
Saboga?

442
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,166
Jerri.
Chapera?

443
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,252
Alicia.
How about for Mogo Mogo?

444
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,671
Richard Hatch.
Chapera, you have two extra

445
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,756
members.
Who's sitting out today?

446
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,133
Amber and Rob.
Mogo Mogo, who's sitting out?

447
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,802
Shii Ann.
Sit outs, over here.

448
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:58,014
Everybody else get blindfolded,
wait for my go.

449
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,436
Callers in place, tribes are
blindfolded.

450
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,273
For immunity, survivors ready?
Go!

451
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,691
>> ALICIA: To your right, to
your right.

452
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:08,858
Keep side stepping right, Sue.
Side step right, Sue.

453
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,820
>> JERRI: Coming to the hill.
You're going to go down the

454
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,363
hill, down the hill, in the
water.

455
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,865
>> RICHARD: Kathy, left!
Kathy left!

456
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,702
You got it, Kathy, right there.
>> ROB M.: Alicia?

457
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:21,663
>> ALICIA: Rob, side step right!
Side step right!

458
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,040
Good, good.
Go forward, Rob, go forward.

459
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:30,338
Grab it.
You got it.

460
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,757
Keep going, keep going!
Big Tom, go forward!

461
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,884
Go forward, go forward, go
forward!

462
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:38,513
Big Tom, you've got it!
Tom, come to my voice!

463
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:41,057
>> ROB M.: Alicia!
>> ALICIA: Drop it, drop it.

464
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,476
Turn around and go straight.
>> JEFF: Chapera with their

465
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,353
first piece.
>> RICHARD: Kathy, keep coming.

466
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,355
You got it.
>> JERRI: Rupert, Rupert, you're

467
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,983
running into Jenna.
Rupert, go to your right.

468
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,693
Right, right, right.
Jenna, go to your right!

469
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,986
Rupert, stop!
Down. Set it down.

470
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,362
>> JEFF: Saboga with a second
piece.

471
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,864
>> JERRI: Ethan, keep going
straight.

472
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,240
>> JEFF: Saboga with a third
piece.

473
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,408
>> JERRI: Set it down.
You're there.

474
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:01,202
RICHARD: Colby, Colby, Colby.
>> JEFF: Ethan throws it on

475
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,787
Colby.
>> RICHARD: Okay, you're good.

476
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,372
>> JEFF: It's become an obstacle
course.

477
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,875
>> RICHARD: Kathy, turn right!
>> JEFF: Tied up at three.

478
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,085
>> ALICIA: Tom, you're done!
Go straight!

479
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,921
That's it, that's it!
Bring it in, bring it in.

480
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,382
Drop it, drop it.
>> JEFF: Big Tom takes a

481
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,009
header.
>> RICHARD: Lex, right.

482
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,052
Lex, right.
Lex, left.

483
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,803
Straight.
>> ALICIA: Drop it, Sue.

484
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:22,057
Drop it, Sue, drop it.
>> JEFF: Sue with another piece

485
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,059
for Chapera.
(<i> Tom grunts</i> )

486
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,853
>> ALICIA: Watch out, watch out!
To your left!

487
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,397
Sue, to your left!
Left! Now, Sue, go straight!

488
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,691
Sue go straight!
>> RICHARD: Lex! Lex!

489
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:37,030
Turn around, go, go forward.
Forward. Forward.

490
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,531
>> ALICIA: Now, Sue, go
straight!

491
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,242
Sue, go straight!
To your left, Sue, and straight!

492
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,411
Rob, stop!
>> JERRI: Drop it! Drop it!

493
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:47,082
>> JEFF: Saboga with 11 pieces.
Chapera at nine, Mogo Mogo with

494
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,043
seven.
>> RICHARD: Kathy, left!

495
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,253
Kathy left!
Kathy, please don't move!

496
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,924
Kathy, just stand there!
Lex, listen to me!

497
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,551
I can't see you!
>> LEX: Rich?

498
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,553
>> RICHARD: Have you got any?
>> LEX: No.

499
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,430
>> RICHARD: All right, Lex, come
back.

500
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,392
I can't see you back there!
I can't tell if there's a

501
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,936
anything!
(<i> Tom grunts</i> )

502
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,730
>> ROB C.: Oh, damn it!
>> JEFF: Big Tom just got

503
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,316
clobbered by Colby.
>> RICHARD: Colby, you're good.

504
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,611
>> JEFF: Big Tom may be hurt.
>> ALICIA: Step to your right.

505
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:19,447
Now throw it down.
>> JEFF: Chapera at 14, Saboga

506
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:23,118
at 14, Mogo Mogo at 12.
>> RICHARD: Lex, take a right.

507
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:26,579
Good. Keep going straight.
>> JEFF: Chapera has their

508
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,957
last piece.
Take your blindfolds off, start

509
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,960
building the puzzle.
Chapera first to start building

510
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:37,298
the puzzle.
Saboga working together.

511
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,843
Stuck in a tree.
>> JERRI: Yes, get over the

512
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,136
tree.
Straight towards me.

513
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,929
>> JEFF: Rupert with Saboga's
last piece.

514
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,973
He's got to get it in the box.
>> RICHARD: Right.

515
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,016
>> JEFF: First two tribes to
finish win immunity.

516
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,438
>> RICHARD: Lex, left.
Lex, Lex, Lex, Lex, Lex, Lex.

517
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:57,527
Stand up, face me, walk two
steps forward.

518
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,113
Swing your arms!
>> JERRI: Perfect.

519
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,323
Rupert, go a little bit to
your right.

520
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,326
>> JEFF: Saboga with all 15.
Start building the puzzle.

521
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:09,581
Take off the blindfolds.
First two tribes to finish win

522
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,459
immunity.
>> JERRI: Bring that piece right

523
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,169
there.
That piece, Ethan.

524
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:19,340
>> JEFF: Chapera working hard.
All those got to match up, guys.

525
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,342
>> RICHARD: Kathy, put that over
in the box.

526
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,344
That's in the box.
>> JEFF: Mogo Mogo, get the

527
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,054
blindfolds off.
Let's start building that

528
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,807
puzzle.
You're still in this.

529
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:31,352
The colors have to line up.
>> LEX: Make sure you put blanks

530
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:37,984
on the bottom.
>> JENNA L.: That's a circle?

531
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,652
No.
>> JERRI: Yes. Yes, it is!

532
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,697
Trust me.
>> JEFF: Jerri continues to

533
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,741
lead Saboga.
>> ROB M.: Why is this two

534
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,160
different colors?
>> JEFF: Chapera struggling

535
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,579
with their puzzle.
Other tribes catching up.

536
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,080
>> SUE: There, right there.
There you go.

537
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,416
Okay, that's it.
Why not?

538
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,711
Oh, two different colors.
>> JERRI: Slide it in.

539
00:29:56,794 --> 00:29:59,047
Last piece, guys.
Last piece.

540
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,382
Last piece.
>> JEFF: Saboga, first tribe

541
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,677
to win immunity.
>> RUPERT: Yeah!

542
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,846
>> JEFF: Keep fighting, Mogo
Mogo.

543
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,224
Keep fighting, Chapera.
>> SUE: Don't destroy the whole

544
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,225
thing.
The wall is good here.

545
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,227
>> JEFF: You are still
fighting for immunity, Mogo

546
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,895
Mogo.
>> LEX: Okay, this is right.

547
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,523
That goes there.
Take that out right there.

548
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,066
>> COLBY: Lex...
Yeah, yeah.

549
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,401
Go over there, Hatch.
>> SHII ANN: Come on, Mogo Mogo.

550
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,196
>> LEX: That goes right there.
>> JEFF: That a way to work,

551
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,365
Mogo Mogo.
>> JENNA L.: Come on, Mogo Mogo.

552
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,909
Send one of them home.
>> SUE: Let's take this piece

553
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,702
out.
Yeah, No, it's not, because we

554
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,955
go higher than that, Alicia.
We go that high.

555
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:35,416
>> RICHARD: Hold on, hold on.
>> COLBY: Yeah, baby, yeah baby.

556
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,794
>> RICHARD: Hold on.
>> COLBY: Yeah!

557
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:40,713
>> JEFF: Mogo Mogo wins
immunity.

558
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:45,260
>> COLBY: Yeah, baby, yeah!
>> KATHY: Oh, that was so great,

559
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,262
you guys.
>> JERRI: I can't believe we

560
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,807
got all the pieces first.
>> JEFF: Saboga, some tough

561
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,769
days, but a break tonight-- no
Tribal Council.

562
00:30:54,852 --> 00:31:01,484
>> JERRI: Hello, lady.
>> JEFF: Mogo Mogo, once again

563
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,945
immunity.
>> LEX: On three.

564
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,531
One, two, three...
>> ALL: Mogo Mogo!

565
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:09,158
>> JEFF: Chapera, first time in
Tribal Council, first member to

566
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,451
be voted out of the tribe
tonight.

567
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,246
You have the afternoon to think
about who that's going to be.

568
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:26,926
Head back to camp.
>> AMBER: Yeah, it was so

569
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,095
frustrating to watch.
It was so frustrating to watch.

570
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:31,347
>> SUE: It's like, okay, we want
brown with pink circle.

571
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,683
>> AMBER: And then you think
you were getting somewhere and

572
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,810
then all of a sudden you had to
start all over again.

573
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:38,271
>> SUE: Oh, it was so bad.
>> ROB M.: Always a way.

574
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:41,983
You can't just have, like, a
really good day all day long.

575
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,610
Today was our first immunity
loss.

576
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,321
I mean, this is the first time
we've got to go to Tribal

577
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,948
Council.
It's day 12, and we just got to

578
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,326
really start playing the game
now.

579
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,662
>> ROB C.: I felt so bad for you
guys when you were taking all

580
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,457
those body shots.
>> ROB M.: A tough challenge,

581
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,834
man.
ROB C.: Today's challenge was

582
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:03,671
especially frustrating.
I think that, with the crew that

583
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:07,759
we had in there, that was not
our best puzzle-building team.

584
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:11,012
And I think if I was in there,
maybe we could have won.

585
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:17,310
I hope the lesson learned here
is that my tribe needs me.

586
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:38,206
>> TOM: I smell you.
I can't see if we were

587
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:42,168
to vote Rob C. off tonight, that
would make us the strongest

588
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:44,712
team.
Honestly, I think Rob C. would

589
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:48,091
have been an asset to this
challenge because we got beat

590
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:51,928
putting the puzzle together, and
I do know that his mind would

591
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:56,391
have worked that puzzle.
I think Rob C's brain is better

592
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,268
than Alicia's.
That's the question we've got to

593
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:02,730
ask ourselves, you know, where
are we the strongest?

594
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,066
>> ROB C.: You want a piece?
It's not that great.

595
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,360
>> ALICIA: No, thank you, babe.
>> SUE: Oh, man.

596
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:08,903
>> ALICIA: I love Rob
Cesternino.

597
00:33:08,986 --> 00:33:11,322
He's a great guy.
I sense that the past couple of

598
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:15,743
days, though, he's known that
his head may be on the chopping

599
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:19,247
block.
Nobody's really talking about it

600
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,082
a lot, though, which is
interesting.

601
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,418
Usually people rally--
especially, this is the first

602
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,546
Tribal Council-- just to make
sure we're all on the same page.

603
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:31,008
I haven't heard one thing.
That makes me a little nervous.

604
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,054
>> ROB M.: I know you know how
to play the game.

605
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,265
>> ROB C.: Mm-hmm.
>> ROB M.: And I know you know a

606
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,891
lot.
I know you'll be very, like,

607
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,560
helpful, and we can make good
allies.

608
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:44,439
>> ROB C.: I... I agree.
Would you be open to considering

609
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,649
getting rid of Alicia before
Sue?

610
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:51,779
>> ROB M.: So you want to get
rid of Alicia and then...

611
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,448
Sue?
>> ROB C.: Yeah.

612
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,117
>> ROB M.: Me, you, and I think
Amber can-can do it.

613
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,454
>> ROB C.: I do get nervous, and
I do get paranoid in this game,

614
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,705
but...
>> ROB M.: With cause.

615
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,790
>> ROB C.: ...as long as I have
your-your assurance on this,

616
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,125
then I'm good.
>> ROB M.: Mm. Want to shake on

617
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:08,963
it?
>> ROB C.: I made an alliance

618
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,592
with Boston Rob, and he says
that the alliance is me, him and

619
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:15,762
Amber.
But I don't know how good Boston

620
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:20,558
Rob's word is, but I've got his
back, and a deal's a deal.

621
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:23,978
>> ALICIA: You guys almost ready
to eat rice?

622
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,315
>> ROB M.: This is good.
>> TOM: Yeah.

623
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,359
>> ROB M.: There's a possibility
at this first Tribal Council

624
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:33,154
that there could be at least one
of three people going--

625
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:39,160
Cesternino, Sue, or Alicia.
I haven't made up my mind yet,

626
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:43,998
but when I do, that's the person
that'll be going home.

627
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,814
>> JEFF: Go ahead and grab a
torch and approach the flame.

628
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,816
You're going to dip your torch
in and get fire.

629
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:13,236
This is part of the ritual of
Tribal Council, because as you

630
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:19,033
all know, fire represents life
on the island and this game.

631
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:20,701
As long as you have fire, you're
still in the game.

632
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:24,872
When your fire's gone, so are
you.

633
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,172
First time for Chapera at Tribal
Council.

634
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,466
So let's talk about the first 12
days.

635
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,677
Big Tom?
Is this tougher physically?

636
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,929
>> TOM: Physically it's pretty
tough.

637
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:43,349
All the challenges so far, I've
had to suck it up.

638
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:47,728
But when you go all out, as this
tribe has done, every challenge,

639
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:52,400
it'll get to you.
>> JEFF: Rob, how does this

640
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:55,236
compare physically?
>> ROB C.: Physically, no doubt,

641
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:58,739
this game is much harder than
the other games that-that we've

642
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,950
played, but that's what we
signed up for.

643
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,161
This is All-Star.
>> JEFF: Amber, is there

644
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:06,247
anything in your normal life
that you notice you're now able

645
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,916
to contribute out here?
>> AMBER: I think I'm very good

646
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,878
at controlling my temper and not
losing it, and I think we have a

647
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,589
few in our tribe who tend to
lose their temper pretty quickly

648
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,091
or throw fits.
And I think I'm very good at

649
00:36:17,174 --> 00:36:20,219
calming people down and talking
some sense into them.

650
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,929
>> JEFF: Who<i> does</i> lose their
temper?

651
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,140
(<i> Amber laughs</i> )
>> AMBER: Well, I think, uh,

652
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:27,059
Boston Rob and Alicia kind of
argue back and forth a little

653
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,769
bit...
>> ALICIA: We only did once.

654
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,439
How many times did we argue?
>> ROB M.: Only one time.

655
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,149
We quelled that real-real
quickly.

656
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,109
>> ALICIA: Once.
We put a kibosh on it.

657
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:38,070
>> JEFF: Sue, what is the impact
of losing this challenge?

658
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,781
>> SUE: Us losing today actually
probably made us more dangerous

659
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,284
for the rest of the challenges.
>> JEFF: Because you gave

660
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,037
yourselves a wake-up call?
>> SUE: Yes.

661
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,122
Yes.
>> JEFF: By the way, Big Tom,

662
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:50,791
how are you feeling?
'Cause you took a hard hit to

663
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,628
the chest or the head today.
>> TOM: I didn't see it coming.

664
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,255
And, uh, the only thing I asked
them was, I wanted them to get

665
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,299
the tag number off that truck
that hit me.

666
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:02,219
>> JEFF: First 12 days for
Chapera, up until today, have

667
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:05,264
been pretty cush.
Big Tom, are you noticing

668
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,934
relationships form?
>> TOM: There's a little bit

669
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,769
of...
I've been noticing cuddling, and

670
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:12,313
there might be a little grinding
there late one night.

671
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,732
>> JEFF: You looked at Boston
Rob when you said that.

672
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:17,652
>> TOM: Well, I've been kind of
watching him a little bit, and

673
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,528
he don't sleep on his back every
night.

674
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:22,698
(<i> quiet laughter</i> )
>> JEFF: Who are you sleeping

675
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:25,284
next to, Boston Rob?
>> ROB M.: I'm sleeping next to

676
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,662
Amber.
>> JEFF: Are you blushing?

677
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,664
>> AMBER: No.
>> JEFF: A little bit?

678
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,999
>> AMBER: No.
>> JEFF: A little something

679
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,793
going on?
>> AMBER: I'm 25.

680
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:37,672
I'm young and having fun.
>> TOM: I'm 48 and old and

681
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,007
watching having fun.
(<i> Amber laughs</i> )

682
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,760
>> JEFF: Is there a little
snuggling going on with, uh,

683
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:45,429
Boston Rob?
>> AMBER: We need to keep warm

684
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,015
at night.
>> JEFF: So this is strictly

685
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,685
survival cuddling.
>> AMBER: I'm out here to play

686
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,853
the game of<i> Survivor.</i>
I'm not out here to play a

687
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,689
dating game.
>> JEFF: Alicia, give me the

688
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,899
straight scoop.
>> ALICIA: Okay, these two are--

689
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,527
You can't even get between them.
You got to be kidding me.

690
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,238
Seriously, they're very close.
I wouldn't even try to sleep

691
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,615
next to Boston Rob and push
Amber to the other side.

692
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,367
That's-that's even out of the
question.

693
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,161
>> JEFF: Does that concern you,
Boston Rob, that there might be

694
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,330
an impression formed?
>> ROB M: No. It's obvious.

695
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:14,041
I mean, we've been flirting with
each other from day one, since

696
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,377
we got out here.
But in terms of the game,

697
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,047
there's going to be one winner,
and my commitment to the game is

698
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:24,719
first and foremost.
>> JEFF: So let's talk about how

699
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,679
you're going to vote somebody
out tonight.

700
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:30,057
What do you base it on, Big Tom?
>> TOM: Right now I was thinking

701
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,852
about our tribe and making it
stronger going into

702
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,688
challenges...
>> JEFF: So you're basing your

703
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,024
vote on who the tribe can afford
to lose?

704
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,233
>> TOM: Yeah.
Basically, yes.

705
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,486
>> JEFF: What-What could cause
you to get voted off tonight,

706
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,947
Boston Rob?
>> ROB M.: I guess my mouth and

707
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,782
my attitude.
What else, Amber?

708
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,285
(Amber, Rob M. laugh)
>> JEFF: Wow, you guys really

709
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:50,828
have become a couple.
(<i> laughter</i> )

710
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:53,080
You just asked your wife.
That was pretty telling.

711
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,915
What else could get Boston Rob
in trouble?

712
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,293
>> AMBER: I just think he has a
big mouth, and he needs to keep

713
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,253
it shut a lot, at challenges, at
camp, all the time.

714
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:01,547
He has a big mouth, and he needs
to keep it shut.

715
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,466
>> ROB M.: I'm very emotional,
Jeff.

716
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:06,761
>> JEFF: Sue, worried at all
that it might be you, really?

717
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:11,098
>> SUE: Oh, yeah.
Ever since I stepped on the

718
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,101
island.
>> JEFF: Why vote you out?

719
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:17,021
>> SUE: 'Cause I can just be a
bitch to be around sometimes.

720
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,856
I mean, you know...
Hey?

721
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:21,734
>> TOM: Hoo-ha.
I didn't say nothing.

722
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:24,987
(<i> laughter</i> )
>> SUE: So, yeah, and I don't go

723
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,740
around sucking up to people or
trying to pretend to be

724
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,617
something I'm not.
>> JEFF: Okay.

725
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,163
It is time to vote.
Rob, you're up.

726
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:49,637
>> ROB C.: I'm a little uneasy
about this vote tonight, but if

727
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,306
everything goes through with
this, I have a feeling the next

728
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:55,101
time I see you, there's going to
be a big finger wagging in my

729
00:39:55,184 --> 00:40:05,152
face.
>> ALICIA: Rob C., you're a

730
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:19,125
face.
>> ALICIA: Rob C., you're a

731
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,670
great guy, and you're really
funny, but I think what we need

732
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:28,175
from here on out is a little
more seriousness.

733
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,480
>> JEFF: I'll go tally the
votes.

734
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,871
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.

735
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,914
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the Tribal

736
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:02,376
Council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.

737
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:10,551
First vote-- Rob C.
Alicia.

738
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:15,723
One vote, Alicia, one vote, Rob.
Rob.

739
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:23,105
Two votes Rob, one vote Alicia.
Rob.

740
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,901
Three votes Rob, one vote
Alicia.

741
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:30,237
The first person voted out of
Chapera.

742
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,072
Rob.
That's enough.

743
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,492
The last vote will remain a
mystery.

744
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:51,675
Rob, the tribe has spoken.
>> JEFF: Well, you guys have had

745
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:59,099
Rob, the tribe has spoken.
>> JEFF: Well, you guys have had

746
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,769
a good easy first 12 days.
You just suffered your first

747
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,270
loss.
The game has just begun.

748
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,941
Grab your torches, head back to
camp.

749

NETWORK TELEVISION
>> JEFF: Stay tuned for scenes

751
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:28,420
from our next episode.
Next time on<i> Survivor,</i> Rupert

752
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:31,757
gets a shot at redemption when
the tribes have to build a raft.

753
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,259
>> RUPERT: I feel good about the
raft.

754
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,843
I'm trying to not think about
the house.

755
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,179
>> JEFF: At Chapera...
>> ROB M.: I got your waterbed

756
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,847
for you.
>> TOM: That's the best built

757
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,517
thing since Alicia.
>> SUE: Tom-- he's a stupid

758
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,143
drunk.
>> JEFF: And the tribes face the

759
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:46,981
first big twist of the game.
>> SHII ANN: Wow!

760
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,820
>> ROB C.: I'm just very
disappointed that I didn't

761
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,697
really have a chance to get into
the game.

762
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,949
I feel like I was kind of
targeted unfairly.

763
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:59,076
What can I say?
Not many people get to play

764
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:02,538
<i>Survivor</i> once in a lifetime.
I got to play it twice.

765
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,873
The first time at Tribal
Council.

766
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,334
I guess I'll take it as a sign
of respect from the rest of the

767
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,795
team, but it's going to take a
little while to swallow this

768
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,339
one.
