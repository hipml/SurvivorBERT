MAYBE I'M NOT ABLE TO PLAY THIS

CLUES TO THE HIDDEN IDOL, SHE

19
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,081
DECIDED TO SHARE IT WITH HER

CLOSEST ALLY.

21
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,252

ALWAYS LEAD TO.

23
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,671

GAVE MATT ZING THEIR SECOND LEAD

00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,269

00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:01,770
THEY HAVE TWICE.

32
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,563

00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,156
TO GO.

>> TO PAIR IN GAME IS

47
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:27,670
DANGEROUS.

48
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,755
GOOD LUCK TO THE REST OF YOU IF

49
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:29,923

>> THAT WAS FUN.

56
00:01:54,781 --> 00:02:01,371
>> IT'S INTERESTING.

57
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,206
>> IT WAS ALL UNNECESSARY.

58
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:08,169
>> WELL, THAT'S THE GAME.

>> STARTING WITH TRIBAL COUNSEL

60
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,467
AND ROXIE JUST KIND OF EXPLODED.

61
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,135
SHE WANTED TO GO OUT WITH A

62
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,929
BANG, I THINK, SO HER STRATEGY

63
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:20,640
WAS JUST TO THROW ME AND MALCOLM

64
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:21,975
UNDER THE BECAUSE BECAUSE THAT'S

65
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,184
THE ONLY THING SHE COULD EVEN

66
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:23,351
SAY.

67
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,811
>> IT'S JUST PART OF THE GAME.

68
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,312
SHE HAS TO POINT OUT ANOTHER

69
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,272
THREAT THAT IS NOT HERS.

70
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,524

THEY KNOW ME AND MALCOMB ARE

74
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:35,905
NOTHING BUT FRIENDS.

75
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:36,322
THEY ALL KNOW THAT.

76
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,367
>> BAD NEWS IS WE HAD TO GO TO

77
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,326
TRIBAL COUNSEL AGAIN AND THERE'S

78
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,286
ONLY FOUR OF US.

HAPPEN.

00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,710
TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

84
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:49,419
THAT ALLIANCE BETWEEN MALCOMB

85
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:53,298
AND ANGIE REAL AND I THINK IT

86
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,090
WAS PRETTY TIGHT.

87

AT THE END OF THE DAY, THAT'S

88
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,634
TWO VOTES.

89
00:02:56,718 --> 00:03:13,610
SO ALL THEY NEED IS ONE MORE.

90
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,653
IF SHE HITCHES TO THE YOUNG ONES

BUT I NEED TO GET MYSELF 100%.

>> YOU'RE NOT A LIABILITY.

111
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,884

00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,265
THAT AND HOPE MY LEG GETS

114
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:07,515
BETTER.

00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:06,991
HARD-CORE WITH OUR CONVERSATION.

148
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,534
WE GAVE EACH OTHER OUR WORD.

149
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,746
OUR WORD IS OUR BOND.

150

IMMUNITY IDOL WITH HER AND THAT

152
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,506
SHOULD PROVE I TRUST HER MORE

153
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:24,550
THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE GAME.

154
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:30,264

00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,026
RICE, YOU KNOW.

159
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,487
IT WAS RIGHT THERE.

160
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:49,242
AND THE CLUE FOR THE IMMUNITY

161
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:49,867
IDOL WAS RIGHT UNDER YOUR NOSE.

RC, PETER AND US.

PETER HAS BEEN A BIT MORE

165
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:57,208
GENUINE WITH ME.

166
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,502

167
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,420
SO WE HAVE THE CLUE AND WE WANT

168
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,672
TO FIND IT BEFORE RC DOES.

169
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:06,008
>> HAVE YOU CHECKED IN THE BAG

170
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:06,509
OF RICE ALL THE WAY AT THE

00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:06,759
BOTTOM.

172
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,763
>> YEAH, WE STUCK OUR HANDS ALL

173
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,974
IN IT.

00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,352
THINGS UNTIL I KNOW WHAT IS

176
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:16,644
GOING ON.

177

>> YOU'RE LUCKY I TRUST YOU

178
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,314
BECAUSE NOW I DON'T TRUST RC.

179

>> I LOOK LIKE I DON'T PAY

180
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,526
ATTENTION BUT I'M PAYING

181
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,695
ATTENTION TO EVERYTHING AROUND

182
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,070
ME.

183
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,613
IT'S LIKE I'M ON SURVEILLANCE

184
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,823
BECAUSE I'M SITTING THERE AND

185
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:29,532
LISTENING AND THEN I KNOW WHAT

186
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:34,078
MOVES TO ME.

187
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,498
>> SO HOW MUCH DO YOU VALUE

188
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,666
STAYING IN THE GAME?

189
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,835
>> I WANT TO STAY IN THE GAME

190
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:41,586
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

191
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,088
>> OK.

192
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,214
BECAUSE YOU KNOW -- I DON'T KNOW

193
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,591
IF YOU KNOW, BUT THEY WANT TO

194
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,551
GET RID OF YOU FIRST, RIGHT?

195
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,177
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

196
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,720
>> WELL, I GUESS, YES.

197
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,972
>> BUT I CAN MAKE STUFF HAPPEN

198
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:56,267
WHERE YOU DON'T GO HOME.

199
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,643
BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO -- FOR YOU

200
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,272
TO STAY IN, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

201
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,398
TO GET RID OF SOMEBODY.

202
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:03,608
>> I FEEL LIKE AN ALLIANCE IS

203
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,319
ONLY AS STRONG AS THE DAY IT IS

204
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:06,527
MADE.

205
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:07,862
THEY WANT TO PUT LISA ON THE

206
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,405
CHOPPING BLOCK TO GET RID OF HER

207
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:09,572
FIRST.

208
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,823
I LIKE LISA.

209
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:11,908
I DON'T SEE ANY PROBLEM WITH HER

210
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,533
AND I SEE SOMEBODY LATER IN THE

211
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,328
GAME THAT I CAN GET RID OF.

212
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,079
>> WOULD YOU BE OK IF WE HAD TO

213
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,164
GET RID OF MIKE?

214
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,333
HE IS GOING TO BE A REAL PROBLEM

215
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,418
AT THE END AND THE LAST PEOPLE

216
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:24,295
WE HAVE, THE HARDER IT'S GOING

217
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:24,837
TO BE.

218
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:29,342
>> SO PETER IS WANTING TO

219
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,551
BLINDSIDE MIKE.

220
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,804
>> AND I WOULD PREFER TO

221
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,514
BLINDSIDE RC BUT PETER IS THE

222
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,059
ONE THAT IS CALLING IT SO I NEED

223
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,894
TO LAY LOW AND GO WITH HIM.

224
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,270
JUST TELL ME WHAT TO DO AND I

225
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:41,979
WILL FOLLOW YOUR LEAD.

226
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,731
>> ALL I NEED FOR YOU IS WHEN I

227
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:44,774
TELL YOU TO VOTE FOR SOMEBODY TO

228
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:44,941
VOTE.

229
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,275
>> OK.

230
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,195
>> THEN WE HAVE THREE VOTES, ME,

231
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,614
YOU AND ABI AND HE IS GONE.

232
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,531
>> WOW.

233
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,783
>> THE BEST ANALOGY AND I'M NOT

234
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:57,495
EVEN A CARD PLAYER, IS THAT JEFF

235
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,580
FEELS LIKE I'M DEALT A NEW HAND

236
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,124
EVERY DAY, AND EVERY DAY I HAVE

237
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,585
TO PLAY THE HAND THAT I HAVE.

238
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,420
YOU'RE UP AND DOWN AND UP AND

239
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:06,837
DOWN.

240
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,924
SO TODAY, I'M UP BUT I'M

241
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:10,841
CAUTIOUSLY UP.

242
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:14,428
>> MIKE, RC, AND THEN TAKE IT

243
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,681
FROM THERE.

244
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:27,817
>>

245
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:35,658
>> MY ASS HURTS.

246
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:39,287
AND I DON'T KNOW IT UNTIL I LIE

247
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:39,662
BACK DOWN.

248
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,623
>> DID YOU TAKE THIS SPOT?

249
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,541
>> NO.

250
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,251
THAT WAS LIKE A PATTERN THING.

251
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:50,589
>> A LITTLE RICE PATTERN THING?

252
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,841
>> WHERE DID THAT GO?

253
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,303
>> DANA AND I ENDED UP LOOKING

254
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,555
AT THE RICE BOX AND ON TOP OF

255
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,473
THE LID THERE WAS AN EMBLEM THAT

256
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,891
WAS NAILED TO THE TOP OF THE

257
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:01,809
RICE BOX.

258
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:05,104
WE NOTICED THAT PIECE IS GONE

259
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:05,271
NOW.

260
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,564
YOU KNOW THAT THING THAT WAS ON

261
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,566
TOP OF THE RICE LID AIN'T THERE

262
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:08,816
ANYMORE.

263
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,777
>> IT MIGHT BE THE IDOL.

264
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,280
>> THAT LITTLE DESIGN PIECE THAT

265
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:18,701
WAS STUCK ON THERE, THAT PIECE,

266
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:25,625
I BUT YOU HE HAS IT.

267
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,961
>> YOU'RE STARING AT THAT THING

268
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:29,462
THE WHOLE TIME.

269
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,630
>> I'M PISSED OFF AND NOT AT

270
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:31,881
JONATHAN.

271
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:32,840
I GIVE HIM PROPS.

272
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,467
IT WAS IN OUR FACE.

273
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,384
WE TOUCHED IT.

274
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:35,760
WE LOOKED AT IT.

275
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,220
WE WEREN'T EVEN CURIOUS ABOUT

276
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:38,387
IT.

277
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,390
AND THAT'S A PURE VETERAN MOVE.

278
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,100
>> WE HAVE A CHALLENGE AND WE

279
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:43,768
LOSE, WE WILL PLAY IT LIKE WE

280
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:44,685
HAVE NO CLUE ABOUT IT.

281
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:49,482
>> PEOPLE WHO WIN THE IDOL WILL

282
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:49,899
GET VOTED OUT.

283
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,275
>> EASY.

284
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:51,901
HE HAS NO CLUE.

285
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,028
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY PLANS TO

286
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:54,695
CONFRONT JONATHAN RIGHT NOW

287
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,072
ABOUT THE IDOL.

288
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,865
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PULL A

289
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:58,824
BLINDSIDE WHERE WE CAN GET

290
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,910
JONATHAN OFF OF THE ISLAND'S

291
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,203
POCKET.

292
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:02,828
ABOVE EVERYTHING I'M TICKED THAT

293
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,831
I LET THE IDOL GO RIGHT BETWEEN

294
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,708
MY EYES.

295
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,378
>> I LOOKED AT IT.

296
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,254
IT WAS RIGHT -- IT WAS RIGHT IN

297
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,591
OUR FACE.

298
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,363
>> YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME.

299
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,864
>> NOPE.

300
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:49,083
>> NO FREAKING WAY!

301
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,086
>> WOKE UP THIS MORNING, DENISE

302
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,254
LOOKS DOWN THE BEACH AND SEES

303
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,505
OUR RAFT IS GONE.

304
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,132
WE THOUGHT WE HAD IT ABOVE THE

305
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,134
TIDE LINE BUT IT'S JUST GONE.

306
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,844
LITTLE BIT OF A MORALE DOWNER.

307
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,595
THAT COULD COME BACK TO HAUNT

308
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,931
US.

309
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:07,977
>>

310
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,854
>> LAST NIGHT THERE WAS NO

311
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,022
CUDDLING WHATSOEVER.

312
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,233
>> WE'RE GOOD.

313
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:18,362
>> THEY HAVE NO IDEA.

314
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:18,988
>> TRIBE OF SIX IS ALREADY DOWN

315
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,238
TO FOUR.

316
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:19,989
AND ME AND DENISE HAVE BEEN

317
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:26,704
TIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING,,.

318
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,664
IF WE GO BACK TO TRIBAL IT WILL

319
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,082
COME DOWN TO ANGIE OR RUSSELL

320
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,042
BUT RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO CLEAR

321
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,962
CUT NEXT CHOICE TO GO HOME.

322
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,380
>> WE WILL MAKE THE DECISION

323
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,717
WHEN IT COMES TIME.

324
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,009
NO SURVEY.

325
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,093
>> EXACTLY.

326
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,345
I REALLY LIKE THAT.

327
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:48,017
I'M FINE, MALCOMB IN THE MIDDLE.

328
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,894
>> THERE WAS SUCH A FOCUS ON

329
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,897
MALCOMB AND ANGIE, A AS COUPLE

330
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,565
AT TRIBAL COUNSELING BUT I'M

331
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,442
STILL HOLDING THAT TRUST MALCOMB

332
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,195
AND I WHEN THE TIME COMES HE

333
00:12:59,278 --> 00:12:59,987
WILL CUT ANGE.

334
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,572
BECAUSE IT'S A NUMBERS GAME I

335
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:02,823
FEEL STRONGER HAVING RUSSELL

336
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,283
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO WIN A

00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,870
CHALLENGE.

338
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:13,334
>> IT'S NICE TO KNOW WE'RE COOL.

339
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,752
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE DECISIONS.

340
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:19,924
>> NOT ON THIS ONE.

341
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,814
>> ARE YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO

00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:36,649

I DO HAVE THE ISLAND.

564
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:35,330
>> THAT WAS ALL UNDER OUR NOSES

565
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:36,331
FOR A WHILE.

566
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:39,835
>> I HAVE THE IDOL.

567
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,503
NOW WE'RE SEPARATED AND I HOPE

568
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,879
WE CAN COME BACK TOGETHER.

569
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:43,463
>> OBVIOUSLY YOU WANT TO GET

570
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:46,550
AHEAD IN THE GAME AND I DO TOO.

571
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,678
IF IT MEANS I GOT TO RIDE IN

572
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,681
YOUR BOAT YOU HAVE POWER AND

573
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:53,890
KNOWLEDGE, I WILL RIDE IN YOUR

574
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,267
BOAT FOR A WHILE.

575
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,686
>> I WILL TRY TO BEFRIEND HIM A

576
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,896
LITTLE BIT AND FORGE A BETTER

577
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,355
RELATIONSHIP.

578
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:00,981
I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WILL

579
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:01,815
BE BEST FOR ME.

580
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:02,607
THIS IS A ME GAME.

581
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,443
IT ISN'T A WE GAME.

582
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,696
I GUESS YOU PROVE SOME OF YOUR

583
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:07,946
LOYALTY.

584
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,323
>> I'M TRYING TO PROVE IT BY

585
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:10,949
LETTING YOU KNOW.

586
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:14,161
>> NOTHING WE CAN DO UNTIL --

587
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:14,369
EXACTLY.

588
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,328
>> ALL RIGHT.

589
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:15,620
GOOD DEAL.

590
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,747
>> AT THE END HE WANTED TO CUT A

591
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,709
DEAL WITH A HANDSHAKE SO I GAVE

592
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,502
HIM A FOUR FINGER HANDSHAKE, NOT

593
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,754
A FIVE-FINGER HANDSHAKE.

594
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:25,505
I'M NOT SO COMMITTED, IN MY BOOK

595
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:29,134
UNLESS IT'S A MANLY HANDSHAKE,

596
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:36,183
IT'S NOT GOING TO COUNT.

597
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,602
>> TANDANG?

598
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,021
>> TANDANG.

599
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,439
>> THAT WAS A TOUGH ONE.

600
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:43,857
>> AND YOU TOOK ANOTHER ONE FOR

601
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,066
THE TEAM ON THE FACE.

602
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,110
>> I HIT THE WATER AND I OPENED

603
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,404
MY EYES AND I COULDN'T SEE

604
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:49,654
ANYTHING.

605
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,655
>> SO YOU BROKE IT.

606
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,992
>> CAN YOU GET ANYMORE INJURIES.

607
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,620
>> TODAY'S CHALLENGE WAS

608
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,496
EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING FOR ME.

609
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,080
THE POSITIVE IS THAT WE DON'T

610
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:04,169
HAVE TO TO GO TO TRIBAL COUNSEL.

611
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,712
WE SHOULD HAVE WON.

612
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,547
MIKE DECIDED TO DIVE FACE FIRST

613
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,091
IN THE WATER WITH THE MASK AND

614
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,801
THE MASK CRASH AFTER TELLING ME

615
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,637
NOT TO DIVE WITH THE MASK, WHO

616
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,349
DOVE WITH THE MASK NO PROBLEM

617
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:17,641
WHATSOEVER.

618
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:18,558
>> DOES NOBODY ELSE WANT TO GO?

619
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,810
>> I WILL GO.

620
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,313
>> I'M ABOUT FED UP WITH MIKE.

621
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,731
NOW HE IS IN MY SITES.

622
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,358
>> ALL RIGHT.

623
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,817
ARE WE GOING CLAM DIGGING?

624
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:32,656
>> WE'RE GO TO HAVE A CLAM BAKE

625
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:32,906
TONIGHT.

626
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:37,994
>>

627
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:42,249
>> WHAS'SUP?

628
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:46,169
>> WELL, EVERYONE IS TALKING

629
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:51,633
CLAMS, I WAS GETTING RIDE ON TO

630
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,343
WORK, WITH YOUR BEACH UNDER YOUR

631
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:53,551
NOSE.

632
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,886
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD BE?

633
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:55,637
HELP ME.

634
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,472
THEY ALL WENT OUT LOOKING FOR

635
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,182
CLAMS AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,

636
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,642
IT'S GOING TO BE EITHER ME

637
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:04,396
FINDING THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL

638
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,689
OR RC SO I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY,

639
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:13,488
I WENT AFTER IT.

640
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:16,199
>> I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO LOOK

641
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:16,449
ANYMORE.

642
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,785
>> WE'RE TOO LATE.

643
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:19,703
RIGHT UNDER YOUR NOSE.

644
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:29,004
>> MAYBE WE'RE ON TOP OF IT.

645
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:35,969
>> WONDER IF I SHOULD TAKE THAT

646
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:36,386
SYMBOL OFF THE RICE.

647
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,345
I DON'T KNOW.

648
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:37,512
MAYBE.

649
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:37,887
>> OH, MY GOSH.

650
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,056
I FOUND IT.

651
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:40,974
I FOUND IT.

652
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:41,683
I FOUND IT.

653
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,435
OH, MY GOSH.

654
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,353
I CAN'T BELIEVE I FOUND IT!

655
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,647
>> THIS IS FREAKING AMAZING.

656
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,483
I KNEW WHERE IT WAS!

657
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:51,609
THE WHOLE TIME.

658
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:52,360
I KNEW IT.

659
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:56,406
>> ABI FOUND THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY

660
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,325
IDOL RIGHT ON TOP OF THE BAG OF

661
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,577
RICE WHICH IS A GOOD THING

662
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,579
BECAUSE SHE'S MY RIGHT HAND MAN.

663
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:03,997
>> LET'S NOT BE STUPID.

664
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,664
>> WE KNOW WE HAVE NUMBERS.

665
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,875
>> OK.

666
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:07,167
SOUNDS GOOD.

667
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,835
>> SO I'M THINKING I COULD

668
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,713
DEFINITELY GET ARTIS AND LISA TO

669
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:12,839
DO WHATEVER I WANT SO IT'S GOING

670
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,258
TO BE EASIER TO GET RID OF MIKE

671
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:15,675
AND NEUTRALIZE RC.

672
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,846
>> I'M SO HAPPY I FOUND IT; I

673
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,182
FOUND IT.

674
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,873
>> I JUST WANT TO SCREAM.

675
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,209
IT'S JUST TRAGIC THAT I'M STUCK

676
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,835
OUT HERE WITH THE GOON SQUAD OF

677
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:51,086
TRIBES.

678
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,338
WE HAVE A GIRL WHO COULDN'T GET

679
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,298
A FLOAT OUT FROM UNDER TWO FEET

680
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,383
OF WATER.

681
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,885
RUSSELL BUILT LIKE AN OX AND

682
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,387
CAN'T CLIMB A THREE FOOT LADDER

683
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,014
OUT OF THE OCEAN.

684
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,432
NOTHING HAS GONE RIGHT.

685
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,143
THIS IS THE GROUP OF GOONS I GET

686
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,938
STUCK WITH?

687
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,191
IT'S LIKE -- THANK GOD FOR

688
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:13,441
DENISE.

689
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,528
DENISE WAS A WAR HORSE TODAY, A

690
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,780
LITTLE MUNCH KIN OF MUSCLE, JUST

691
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:19,406
CRANKED THEM OUT.

692
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,782
>> SERIOUSLY HOW MANY TIMES DID

693
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:21,241
YOU GO DOWN.

694
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:21,991
>> I DID THREE.

695
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,660
>> SO WE BOTH DID THREE.

696
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,078
>> WHAT THE HELL, SHE COULDN'T

697
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,621
EVEN GET THE FIRST ONE.

698
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:29,541
AND THEN RUSSELL?

699
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,793
COULDN'T CLIMB THE LADDER.

700
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:35,338
GRAB THE SIDE.

701
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,174
WE'RE GETTING HIT ONE BY ONE.

702
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,968
>> HEY, YOU --

703
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,970
>> FOR THE RECORD I NEVER SAID I

704
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:42,887
CAN'T DO THOSE.

705
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,597
>> I DON'T WANT MALCOMB AND

706
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,266
DENISE TO THINK OF ME AS A WEAK

707
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,268
LINK OR AS A GIRL WHO JUST GIVES

708
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,687
UP BECAUSE I NEVER SAID I CAN'T.

709
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,313
I MEAN I AM THE YOUNGEST.

710
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:52,939
I HAVE BEEN PROVING MYSELF AND I

711
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,649
HOPE THEY CAN SEE THAT.

712
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:57,777
>> I NEVER SAID I CAN'T.

713
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,904
I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO MY TEAM.

714
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:00,989
I WON'T DO IT.

715
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:01,865
I WON'T GO.

716
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:02,157
>> I KNOW.

717
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,325
WE KNOW YOU DID.

718
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,369
>> I THINK IT WOULD BE A

719
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,912
RIDICULOUS CHOICE TO KEEP ANGIE

720
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:08,830
AT THIS POINT BUT I DON'T KNOW

721
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:12,083
THAT I COULD GET MALCOMB TO VOTE

722
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,002
ANGIE AND RUSSELL, RUSSELL

723
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,044
COULDN'T CLIMB A LADDER.

724
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,671
MAYBE ME NEEDS TO GO HOME.

725
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:18,047
>> IT'S A TOUGH DECISION.

726
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,007
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS THINKING.

727
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,010
>> I THINK RUSSELL.

728
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,387
>> YEAH.

729
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:37,567
HANG IN THERE.

730
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,528
>> WE LOST THE IMMUNITY

731
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,279
CHALLENGE AGAIN.

732
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,947
AND EVERYBODY THAT IS THEIR

733
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:43,239
WEAKNESSES.

734
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,783
MINE SHOWED UP TODAY, DIVING

735
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:49,120
10 FEET DOWN, THAT'S JUST NOT MY

736
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:49,913
THING.

737
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:54,167
>> WELL, LORD, WHATEVER YOUR

738
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:59,756
WILL BE THY WILL BE DONE.

739
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,509
>> IT'S HARD TO SEE A CLEAR PATH

740
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:02,717
FORWARD.

741
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,886
IF THEY WANT TO MAKE A BOLD MOVE

742
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,597
AND GET RID OF ME BECAUSE THIS

743
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,807
IS THE TIME TO GET RID OF A

744
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:16,064
STRONG PLAYER, I COULD BE GONE.

745
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:20,068
>> EVEN RIGHT NOW LORD, I SAY

746
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:20,360
HALLELUIAH.

747
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,695
>> WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS GAME

748
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,030
THAT FRIGHTENS ME SO MUCH?

749
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:24,906
LAST TIME I ALMOST DIED.

750
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,033
THIS TIME I THOUGHT IT WAS

751
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,535
DIFFERENT AND THEN WE LOSE THE

752
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,744
FIRST CHALLENGE AND THE SECOND

753
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:31,120
CHALLENGE AND NOW WE LOST THE

754
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:31,788
THIRD CHALLENGE.

755
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:32,997
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S

756
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:36,668
GOD'S PLAN FOR ME TO BE HERE FOR

757
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:37,919
JUST A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME.

758
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:42,257
>> THANK YOU.

759
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:47,887
>> JESUS CHRIST NAME, AMEN.

760
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:54,018
>> I AM DOWN BUT I AM NOT OUT.

761
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:29,721
♪ .

762
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:32,932
>> I WOULD HAVE GONE AGAIN.

763
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,684
I WOULD HAVE GONE 12 BUT I WOULD

764
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,394
HAVE WENT AND DENISE WENT RIGHT

765
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:37,103
FOR IT BECAUSE SHE IS SUPER

766
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,229
FAST.

767
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,105
I WOULD RATHER HAVE SOMEONE DO

768
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,316
IT THAT IS FAST.

769
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,067
IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN'T DO IT BUT

770
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:46,696
I WANTED US TO GO AHEAD AND BE

771
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:46,904
FAST.

772
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:47,363
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

773
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:50,158
>> TOTALLY.

774
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,367
HE QUIT AND YOU WOULDN'T HAVE

775
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:51,576
QUIT.

776
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,243
>> HE DID QUIT.

777
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,328
>> TONIGHT IS HARD.

778
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,746
THE FIRST TWO ARE EASY.

779
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,831
BETWEEN RUSS AND ANGIE, IT'S A

780
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:57,457
TOSS UP FOR DIFFERENT REASONS.

781
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,167
ME AND RUSS HAVE NOT TALKED

782
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,711
STRATEGY SINCE DAY ONE.

783
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,796
ANGIE ON THE OTHER HAND IS -- I

784
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,131
WOULDN'T SAY IN MY POCKET BUT

785
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,133
SHE WOULD DO WHATEVER WE WANT TO

786
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:07,383
DO.

787
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,385
I JUST HAVE TO KEEP MYSELF

788
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,054
POSITIONED AS STRONG AS I

789
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,221
POSSIBLY CAN.

790
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,097
>> WE HAVE TO WIN SOMETHING.

791
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,475
WE CAN'T KEEP LOSING EVERYTHING.

792
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:18,770
>> I MEAN, YEAH, I SUCKED BUT

793
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:21,981
HE'S 20 YEARS OLDER THAN ME, A

794
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:22,732
HUNDRED POUNDS MORE THAN ME.

795
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:23,358
>> HE IS MORE THAN TWICE YOUR

796
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:23,524
AGE.

797
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,694
>> I TRUST MALCOMB AND I KNOW

798
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,571
DENISE AND MALCOMB WILL GET OUT

799
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:28,821
RUSSELL.

800
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,865
I DO FEEL BAD BECAUSE HE WANTS

801
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:32,283
THIS SO BAD AND HE WANTS TO MAKE

802
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,159
THE MERGE SO BAD.

803
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:36,412
>> BUT HE IS NOT DOING ANYTHING.

804
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,956
I MEAN HE IS GREAT AROUND CAMP.

805
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,375
>> TONIGHT AT CAMP I WANT TO

806
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,669
SHOW THEM AND SAY I'M HERE TO

807
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,088
WIN, I WILL DO 100%, I'M HERE TO

808
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,214
DO ANYTHING IT TAKES AND I WANT

809
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,799
TO WIN.

810
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:53,638
THAT'S MY NUMBER ONE GOAL.

811
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,014
>> THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE

812
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:58,351
WHO HAVE COME BEFORE ME.

813
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,895
MY ANCESTORS WHO HAVE DEALT WITH

814
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:03,231
THE MIDDLE PASSAGE, JIM CROW,

815
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:07,944
WHATEVER -- PEOPLE WHOSE

816
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,028
SHOULDERS I STAND ON HAVE

817
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,114
PERSEVERED, AND AT THE END OF

818
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:14,283
THE DAY, THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING

819
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:17,995
TO DRAW MY STRENGTH.

820
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,665
BECAUSE TO NOT CONTINUE TO FIGHT

821
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,208
WOULD BE TO SPIT IN THE FACE OF

822
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:26,963
ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ENDURED

823
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,841
SO MUCH MORE THAN I WILL EVER

824
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:32,635
ENDURE IN MY LIFE, AND

825
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:36,097
DEFINITELY IN THIS DAM GAME.

826
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,790
>> WELL, THE BAD NEWS IS, YOU

827
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,208
WILL BE DOWN TO THREE AFTER

828
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:04,584
TONIGHT.

829
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,252
THE GOOD NEWS IS FOR THE THREE

830
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,254
THAT WILL REMAIN, YOU'RE NOT

831
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,047
OUT.

832
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,298
DENISE, WHAT DID YOU SACRIFICE

833
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,507
TO COME OUT HERE?

834
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,010
>> OH, SIX WEEKS AWAY FROM MY

835
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,261
DAUGHTER WHO I LOVE TO DEATH AND

836
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:15,553
MY HUSBAND.

837
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,847
I OWN A PRIVATE PRACTICE AT HOME

838
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,264
SO I LOSE INCOME.

839
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:21,100
I HAVE CLIENTS THAT I HOPE ARE

840
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:21,267
OK.

841
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,602
IT'S HUGE.

842
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:24,520
I'M NOT WILLING TO ROLL OVER AND

843
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:25,271
JUST GIVE UP.

844
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,272
>> MALCOMB, HOW BIG OF A DEAL

845
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:27,190
WITH THIS FOR YOU?

846
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:30,109
>> I MEAN THE FIRST SEASON OF

847
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,153
"SURVIVOR" AIRED WHEN I WAS 12

848
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,070
YEARS OLD.

849
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,197
YOU'RE LAYING IN BED THINKING

850
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,573
HOW COOL THAT WOULD BE IF IT'S

851
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,240
YOU ONE DAY.

852
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,201
IT'S OVER A DECADE LATER AND I'M

853
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,828
FINALLY HERE AND IT'S GOING THIS

854
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,580
POORLY, I'M NOT AN EMOTIONAL GUY

855
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,373
IN THE SLIGHTEST BUT I WAS

856
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,458
BETWEEN TEARS AND SCREAMING

857
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:46,250
AFTER THE CHALLENGE TODAY, AND I

858
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,336
HAVE FRIENDS AND FAMILY BACK

859
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,670
HOME WHO ARE JUST GOING TO

860
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,631
ASSOCIATE ME WITH THE TRIBE THAT

861
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:54,300
KEEPS HAVING TO GO SEE YOU EVERY

862
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:57,178
TRIBAL COUNCIL: IT'S HEART

863
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,472
BREAKING IS THE WORD.

864
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:00,306
>> HEART BREAKING.

865
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,517
>> WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM

866
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:02,809
FRUSTRATION.

867
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,186
>> FRUSTRATION WAS DAY THREE.

868
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,729
ON DAY EIGHT IT'S HEART

869
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:07,105
BREAKING.

870
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,898
>> SO MALCOMB WHAT DO YOU DO?

871
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,526
>> WE'RE PAST THE TIME OF

872
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,237
PLAYING NICE HOW CHALLENGES GO.

873
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,947
CERTAIN PEOPLE STRUGGLED TODAY.

874
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,365
THAT'S ON THOSE WHO KNEW WE WERE

875
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,408
CAPABLE OF THINGS AT THIS

876
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,701
CHALLENGE AND DIDN'T TAKE OVER

877
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:20,910
EARLIER.

878
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:23,162
>> I DIDN'T APPEAR YOU OR DENISE

879
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:23,538
STRUGGLE.

880
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,998
>> I'M NOT BEATING AROUND THE

881
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:26,874
BUSH.

882
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,167
ANGIE AND RUSS HAD PROBLEMS ON

883
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,335
THE DIVING PORTION OF THE

884
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:29,961
CHALLENGE TODAY.

885
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,337
IT SETTLES ON THEM HEAVIER THAN

886
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,590
MYSELF AND DENISE, ME AND DENISE

887
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,591
COULD HAVE STEPPED UP MORE AND

888
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:36,384
SAID WE KNOW WE WERE THE

889
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,928
SWIMMERS AND FOR US TO GO BY

890
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,596
THIS EVERYBODY GETS A TURN AND

891
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,181
IT'S FIFTH GRADE DODGEBALL

892
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:45,184
MENTALITY NEEDS TO STOP.

893
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,352
THE PEOPLE NEED TO STEP UP AND

894
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:49,146
THE REST OF THEM HAVE TO GO

895
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:49,355
HOME.

896
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:52,316
>> ANGIE, ARE YOU CONCERNED IT

897
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,192
MIGHT BE YOU TONIGHT?

898
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,193
>> YES, I AM.

899
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:54,986
I WAS SLOW.

900
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,445
BUT I WOULD HAVE DONE MY SECOND

901
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:56,821
ONE.

902
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,489
I REALLY WOULD HAVE BUT SHE IS

903
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,407
SUCH A BETTER DIVER THAN ME WHY

904
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,993
NOT LET HER DO IT AND GET IT

905
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:02,368
DONE FASTER.

906
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,370
>> WOULD IT BE FAIR TO VOTE YOU

907
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,371
OUT TONIGHT FOR THAT?

908
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,330
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

909
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,416
RUSSELL DID THE FIRST ONE.

910
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,292
HE COULDN'T GET UP ON THE

911
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,376
LADDER.

912
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,753
HIS SECOND TIME HE WENT IN, HE

913
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,046
COMPLETELY GAVE UP.

914
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:14,630
ME, I WOULD NOT GIVE UP AND I

915
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,674
WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT, THAT I'M

916
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:17,884
A FIGHTER.

917
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,343
>> RUSSELL, ANGIE JUST CLEARLY

918
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,762
SAID, LISTEN, ONE THING I DIDN'T

919
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:22,221
DO IS QUIT.

920
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,514
RUSSELL GAVE UP.

921
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,100
>> NO, RUSSELL MADE A STRATEGIC

922
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:27,935
DECISION TO 1207 WHAT HE WAS

923
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,645
DOING, KNOWING 'TWAS GOING TO

924
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,355
END IN FAILURE SO WE WOULD AT

925
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,773
LEAST HAVE A CHANCE TO MOVE ON.

926
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,358
I HEAR WHAT ANGIE IS SAYING BUT

927
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,402
AT THE END OF THE DAY, MISS

928
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,070
ANGIE CAN'T HOLD A CANAL TO WHAT

929
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,739
I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO OFFER

930
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,157
THIS TRIBE GOING FORWARD.

931
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,492
KNOWING THAT THERE'S 30 DAYS

932
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,328
LEFT TO GO, SHE AIN'T READY.

933
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:48,247
I AM.

934
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:51,167
SO LIFE EXPERIENCE, INTELLECTUAL

935
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,919
CAPABILITY, PHYSICAL CAPABILITY,

936
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,087
TO ME, THE CHOICE IS CLEAR.

937
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,340
>> HONESTLY, JEFF, I KNOW I'M

938
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,424
ONLY 20 YEARS OLD AND I DON'T

939
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,300
HAVE THE EXPERIENCE THAT RUSSELL

940
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,969
HAS BUT I THINK I CAN FIGHT MORE

941
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:06,140
THAN RUSSELL, HONESTLY.

942
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:07,099
>> WHAT?

943
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,684
>> I WAS WILLING TO DIE FOR THIS

944
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,519
GAME THE LAST TIME I PLAYED.

945
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,521
ARE YOU WILLING TO PUT YOUR LIFE

946
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:13,481
ON THE LINE, LITTLE GIRL?

947
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,815
COME ON.

948
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,817
YOU WENT IN THAT WATER TWO FEET.

949
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:17,735
YOU WERE SLOW BECAUSE YOU DID

950
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,236
NOT HAVE THE PHYSICAL STRENGTH

951
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,322
TO GET THAT RING OFF OF THERE.

952
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,366
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

953
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,993
THIS REVISIONIST HISTORY THING

954
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:26,577
YOU'RE DOING IN TERMS OF WHAT

955
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,496
HAPPENED ON THE PLATFORM, IT MAY

956
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,413
WORK HERE FOR JEFF BUT ALL OF US

957
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,040
WERE THERE.

958
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,792
WHEN YOU CAME BACK, YOU WERE

959
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:33,000
DONE.

960
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,460
YOU HAD GIVEN UP.

961
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:37,505
SO I MEAN, COME ON --

962
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:41,759
>> ANGIE, IS THIS HITTING HARD?

963
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:52,770
>> I FEEL THIS SMALL RIGHT NOW.

964
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:57,608
IT JUST SUCKS.

965
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:58,859
I DON'T EVER CRY.

966
00:37:58,943 --> 00:37:59,568
I REALLY DON'T.

967
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,362
>> I THINK EVERYBODY HERE IS

968
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,780
SAYING THEY DO BELIEVE YOU GAVE

969
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:03,030
YOUR ALL.

970
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,032
I THINK WHAT RUSSELL IS SAYING

971
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,534
IS YOU CAN'T HOLD A CANDLE TO

972
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:06,701
ME.

973
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,494
>> IT'S HARD TO COMPETE WITH

974
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:08,744
HIM.

975
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,121
IT HONESTLY IS.

976
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,747
LOOK AT HIM.

977
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,291
>> BECAUSE THE SITUATION SHE IS

978
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,710
GETTING THRUST INTO A ROLE THAT

979
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:16,460
WAS PROBABLY NEVER MEANT FOR

980
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,421
HER, A STRENGTH ROLE.

981
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:19,797
THERE ARE LITTLE GIRLS ON THE

982
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,465
OTHER TRIBES THAT HAVEN'T HAD TO

983
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,718
DO THE THINGS SHE HAS HAD TO DO

984
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,678
IN TWO CHALLENGES YET.

985
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,054
SHE'S IN A TOUGHER SITUATION

986
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,389
THAN ANY OTHER YOUNG GIRL IS

987
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,015
RIGHT NOW.

988
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:32,059
>> SO DENY THESE THIS IS A TOUGH

989
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:32,226
VOTE.

990
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:33,352
THERE'S ONLY THE FOUR OF YOU.

991
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,938
YOU HAD TO HAVE MADE SOME

992
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:36,647
FRIENDSHIPS, PROBABLY ALLIANCES

993
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,440
AND NOW YOU HAVE THIS STRENGTH

994
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,358
THING BUT ALSO HAVE LOYALTY.

995
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,610
WHAT IF THEY CLASH?

996
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,487
>> DEFINITELY YOU THINK OF

997
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:43,946
LOYALTY.

998
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,489
ANY ALLIANCES YOU HAVE MADE YOU

999
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,116
HAVE TO THINK OF THAT BECAUSE

1000
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,701
WHEN THERE'S A MERGE YOU NEED

1001
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:48,909
THAT.

1002
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,036
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

1003
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,412
WOULD LEAD MY VOTE MORE THAN

1004
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,164
ANYTHING IS THE LOYALTY.

1005
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,833
>> MALCOMB, HOW IMPORTANT IS

1006
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:56,459
LOYALTY IF YOU WANT TO WIN AND

1007
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,502
GET THE VOTES?

1008
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,296
>> IF YOU WANT TO WIN AND GET

1009
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:03,382
THE VOTES, LOYALTY IS PARAMOUNT

1010
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,383
BUT WE HAVE TO GET TO THE POINT

1011
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,468
WHERE YOU CAN WIN THE GAME.

1012
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:08,304
SO TONIGHT'S VOTE IS A BALANCING

1013
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:09,096
ACT BETWEEN STRENGTH AND

1014
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,182
LOYALTY, WHICH ONE DO WE NEED TO

1015
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,893
GO WITH, AND THIS IS THE

1016
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,770
QUESTION.

1017
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:16,771
WE SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE TO THINK

1018
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:20,232
ABOUT ON DAY EIGHT.

1019
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:20,733
>> JEFF: OK.

1020
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,526
IT'S TIME TO VOTE.

1021
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:28,491
RUSSELL, YOU'RE UP.

1022
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:30,076
>> I'M SORRY I MADE YOU CRY.

1023
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,203
THAT'S THE WAY THIS GAME SEEMS

1024
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,496
TO BE PLAYING, AND I HAVE TO

1025
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:46,926
PLAY HARD OR GO HOME.

1026
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:51,180
>> ONE THING ABOUT ME IS I NEVER

1027
00:39:51,263 --> 00:40:02,566
GIVE UP.

1028
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:12,827
>> I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.

1029
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,371
>> IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN

1030
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:16,372
IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO

1031
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,581
PLAY IT NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO

1032
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:23,379
DO SO.

1033
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:23,546
OK.

1034
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:24,713
ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ THE

1035
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,090
ASKTION IS FINAL AND THE PERSON

1036
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,509
VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE

1037
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,802
THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA

1038
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:30,094
IMMEDIATELY.

1039
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,595
I WILL READ THE VOTES.

1040
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:38,978
>> FIRST VOTE, ANGIE.

1041
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,605
>> RUSS, ONE VOTE ANGIE, ONE

1042
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,523
VOTE RUSS.

1043
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,442
>> ANGIE.

TWO VOTES ANGIE, ONE VOTE RUSS.

1045
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:51,532
ONE VOTE LEFT.

1046
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,326
>> THIRD PERSON VOTED OUT OF

1047
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:54,869
SURVIVOR PHILIPPINES, ANGIE.

1048
00:40:54,952 --> 00:41:04,795
YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.

1049
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:08,632
>> ANGIE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

1050
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,302
>> GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

1051
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:11,635
KICK SOME ASS.

1052
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,220
>> TIME TO GO.

1053
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:20,186
>> THANK YOU.

1054
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,645

AROUND.
