>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on

2
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:04,462
<i>Survivor...</i>

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:05,130
>> I'm not going to fight with

4
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:05,422
these kids.

5
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:06,881
They hate us.

6
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:07,757
>> PROBST: When the fans' camp

7
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:08,299
was filled with disarray...

8
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:09,968
>> Everyone is tired.

9
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:10,969
Everyone is hungry.

10
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:12,387
>> We need to fix our shelter.

11
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,430
>> PROBST: ...Joel was vocal

12
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,973
about getting the group back

13
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:15,640
together.

14
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:16,683
>> Why is everybody talking all

15
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,435
the time and not working?

16
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,561
>> PROBST: At Malakal, two

17
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:20,729
couples came together

18
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,772
strategically and romantically,

19
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,358
creating a formidable alliance.

20
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:26,776
>> I think we'll be receiving

21
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,194
birth announcements from Ando

22
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,154
and her little Ozzlets that

23
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,448
she's about to have.

24
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,158
And Parvati and James will be at

25
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,409
the wedding as soon as this is

26
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:35,535
over.

27
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:36,911
>> PROBST: Jonathan, Yau-Man,

28
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,621
Eliza, and Ami created a second

29
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:39,873
alliance...

30
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:40,665
>> Hands in.

31
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:41,124
I'll do it.

32
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:41,458
I'll do it.

33
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,917
>> PROBST: And both sides needed

34
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,127
Cirie to gain a majority.

35
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:44,461
>> I don't care.

36
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,920
I'll get rid of anybody, as long

37
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,213
as it's not me.

38
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:47,756
>> PROBST: At the immunity

39
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:48,298
challenge, the favorites won

40
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,132
easily.

41
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,217
Favorites win immunity!

42
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,511
With the fans facing tribal

43
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,305
council, Mikey B. attempted to

44
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,389
control the vote.

45
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,348
>> Let's get the final plan

46
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,349
right now, and then we don't

47
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,476
have to talk about it again.

48
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,310
>> PROBST: But after watching

49
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,103
Mikey B. form a close bond with

50
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,397
Mary, Joel had other ideas.

51
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,440
>> Mikey thinks he's running

52
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:06,691
this whole show.

53
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:07,734
He and Mary have to be broken

54
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:08,693
up.

55
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:09,652
Mary's going home.

56
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,945
Mikey will be completely

57
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,655
confused as to what happened.

58
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,865
>> PROBST: At tribal council,

59
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:14,324
Joel's plan worked.

60
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,242
Second person voted out of

61
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,243
<i>Survivor: Fans vs. Favorites,</i>

62
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,578
Mary.

63
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,413
And a stunned Mikey B. watched

64
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,540
his closest ally go home.

65
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,875
18 are left.

66
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:31,174
Who will be voted out tonight?

67
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,009
>> Be careful right here, you

68
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,844
guys-- right here.

69
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,221
>> I can only assume the big guy

70
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,181
Joel stuck a knife in my back

71
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,476
already.

72
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,394
Interesting.

73
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,271
I don't blame the move, okay,

74
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,147
you know, as long as the move is

75
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:50,527
not you to take that whole crew.

76
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,612
That would be you with four

77
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,531
girls and a kid, you know?

78
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,323
>> Yeah.

79
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,574
>> And Chet is included as a

80
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,200
girl.

81
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,744
Joel is playing a long game

82
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:00,328
right now when he should be

83
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,122
focusing on a short game.

84
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,290
When it gets down to the merge,

85
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,209
you get rid of the strong ones.

86
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,086
When it's team versus team, you

87
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,212
keep your strength and you get

88
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,672
rid of your weakness.

89
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,549
And these people-- Tracy, Kathy,

90
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,176
and Chet-- are weak around camp,

91
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,219
and they're weak in the

92
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:16,511
challenges.

93
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:19,138
They're all useless.

94
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:19,973
I know it's a million bucks, but

95
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:20,974
you're not going to win with

96
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,100
them.

97
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,810
I mean, you're not doing it.

98
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:24,978
>> Mikey thinks he's got all the

99
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,354
answers, and he guarantees I'll

100
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:29,607
never make it to the final four,

101
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,150
and he just thinks he's got this

102
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,694
whole tribe in his pocket.

103
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:33,319
>> I consider it that you made a

104
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,238
move that you didn't have to

105
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,699
make, okay, necessarily.

106
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:38,783
And you know, if you want to

107
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,159
make up for it, you can.

108
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:40,743
>> And I would really, really

109
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,871
like to see the look on his face

110
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:43,955
when the baseball bat comes

111
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:44,581
swinging up beside him and wakes

112
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,207
him up to the reality that he

113
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,458
doesn't have this tribe in his

114
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,502
pocket.

120
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:07,830
>> I'm glad you guys told me to

121
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:08,289
come down.

122
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,457
I was, like, hanging out with

123
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,584
the old people.

124
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,544
I'm only 24.

125
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,754
I mean, not old, not old,

126
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:15,922
just...

127
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:16,422
>> They go to bed early.

128
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:20,301
>> Just tired of that damn cave.

129
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,678
>> Amanda, Ozzy, James, and

130
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,804
Parvati said they were going to

131
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:23,763
go down to the beach, and they

132
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:24,472
said, "Come with us.

133
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:25,473
It will be fun."

134
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:26,391
So I went down there with them,

135
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,893
and they were working me.

136
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,444
>> Right.

137
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,075
>> You dislike Jonathan that

138
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,451
much, huh?

139
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,209
>> They were like, "You know, I

140
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:53,835
think we need to keep this team

141
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:54,377
strong, and I think the two

142
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,212
weakest people are Yau-Man and

143
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:56,921
Cirie.

144
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:57,797
I think we need to get them out

145
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,673
of here."

146
00:04:58,756 --> 00:04:59,507
And I kind of was like, "Oh,

147
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,259
yeah, sure, okay."

148
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,928
I listened to them, but I don't

149
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,806
trust them.

150
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,099
They'd be stupid to stick with

151
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:08,725
us knowing that the five of us

152
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,477
are so tight.

153
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,563
>> So what's the proposal?

154
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:17,817
>> They've been working.

155
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,528
They've been trying.

156
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,447
>> Unless they think that they

157
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,948
have a chance with Cirie.

158
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,116
>> Well, there's definitely a

159
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,826
little bit of juggling the two

160
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,078
foursomes, because they need my

161
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,747
vote, either side.

162
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,831
And I'm still trying to figure

163
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:35,710
out which side is better for me.

164
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,003
>> If we get another vote, then

165
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,629
Parvati's going to go, right?

166
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,214
>> For sure.

167
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:43,301
>> She's weak enough and... and

168
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,343
threatening enough because of

169
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,511
her relationships with Ozzy and

170
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,554
with James.

171
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,513
>> And with Amanda.

172
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,097
I mean, the two of them have

173
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:48,556
been bonding.

174
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,432
>> As long as the five of us

175
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,934
stay strong, and we are, then

176
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,603
we're cool.

177
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,937
>> In this game, for me, it's

178
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,397
all about who I think I can

179
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,899
trust.

180
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,442
And if I feel that I can trust

181
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,027
you, then I'm willing to go all

182
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,527
the way with you.

183
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,696
But if I don't trust you, then

184
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,281
you can't believe a word I tell

185
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,617
you.

186
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:18,336
>> Tree mail!

187
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,712
>> Tree mail!

188
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:20,671
>> Uh-oh!

189
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:21,631
>> This is a big tree mail, you

190
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:21,839
guys.

191
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,092
>> Big tree mail.

192
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,177
>> Okay, it says, "Preparing to

193
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,804
go into battle, use war paint

194
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,097
and a battle cry.

195
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,223
Are you ready to tackle your

196
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,224
enemy?"

197
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:31,432
Oh!

198
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,559
"You better be ready to try.

199
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,727
So pick three choices for your

200
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:35,603
reward.

201
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,854
Today will be an aggressive

202
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,314
meeting.

203
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,274
If you win, you take them home.

204
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:40,817
Lose, and you just take a

205
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,568
beating."

206
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:42,819
>> Okay.

207
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,569
>> It's our wrestling one that

208
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,445
we've wanted for so long.

209
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,155
>> This is our comfort

210
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,073
catalogue.

211
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,741
>> Ah!

212
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:49,992
Wow.

213
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:50,910
>> How many do we get to pick?

214
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:51,494
>> Three.

215
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,787
>> We get to pick three?

216
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,497
>> Oh, God!

217
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,540
>> We get three things, guys.

218
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,041
>> Right.

219
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:57,708
>> That's awesome.

220
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,459
>> All right!

221
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,669
>> Ready?

222
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,670
Shelter-- tarp and rope.

223
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,673
>> Tarp and rope would be good.

224
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:04,966
>> Sleeping items-- blankets,

225
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,717
pillows, mattress.

226
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,010
We've got to use our war paint,

227
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:08,803
and we've got to come up with a

228
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:09,470
battle cry.

229
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:13,933
>> Yes!

230
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,351
>> We're going to war.

231
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:16,727
>> Yeah.

232
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:17,562
Yeah, it's war.

233
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,146
>> Y'all better get serious

234
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,231
about this.

235
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,149
>> It should be like... just

236
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:21,691
like a little, bitty heart.

237
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,484
>> Are you ready to bring it?

238
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,527
>> Let's do it!

239
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,988
>> We are going to kick some ass

240
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,114
today.

241
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,116
>> I know.

242
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,325
>> There's no way we're going to

243
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,076
lose today.

244
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,077
We're going to decimate them.

245
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:33,828
We have the will.

246
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,079
We've been dry.

247
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:35,872
We've been eating.

248
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,123
>> Ah!

249
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:37,874
>> There's no way we're losing

250
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,625
this challenge.

251
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,128
>> We lost our last challenge.

252
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:42,712
Morale is a little bit down.

253
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,381
But you can't fight emotionally.

254
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:47,091
You have to fight logically.

255
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,509
And logically, if somebody comes

256
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,969
and invades my home, I'm going

257
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,053
to kill them.

258
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:51,929
>> Malakal!

259
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:52,638
Malakal!

260
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,932
Malakal!

261
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,647
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

262
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:06,944
Favorites getting your first

263
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,322
look at the new tribe of fans.

264
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:09,864
Mary voted out at the last

265
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,825
tribal council.

266
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,162
>> Mary?

267
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,371
>> PROBST: This morning in tree

268
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,289
mail, you were both given war

269
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,707
paint.

270
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,459
Glad to see you put it to good

271
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,377
use, because today is going to

272
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,338
be a battle.

273
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,964
For today's challenge, both

274
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:27,715
tribes will start at opposite

275
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:31,093
ends of a lagoon in their

276
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,553
opponent's end zone.

277
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,764
On my go, you will charge across

278
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,265
the lagoon toward the other

279
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,725
tribe carrying three canvas

280
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,268
bags.

281
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,270
Your goal is to get your three

282
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,439
bags, plus two bags from the

283
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:46,108
other tribe, into your end zone.

284
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,527
You are allowed to steal bags

285
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,071
from your opponent's end zone

286
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,156
even after they've scored.

287
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,951
First tribe to get five bags in

288
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,703
their end zone at the same time

289
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,956
wins reward.

290
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,915
This morning, in tree mail, you

291
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,333
were also given a catalog, told

292
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,252
to choose three items.

293
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,378
Here's what the favorites are

294
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,631
playing for: shelter, lighting

295
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,925
kit, survival kit.

296
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,093
Here's what the fans are playing

297
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,803
for.

298
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,264
They chose differently: fishing

299
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,267
kit, shelter, and a kitchen set.

300
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,393
Winning tribe gets their three

301
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,560
items.

302
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,436
Worth playing for?

303
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,229
>> Yeah!

304
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,772
>> PROBST: Let's get it on.

305
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,320
All right!

306
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:31,946
Got a little bit of rain to make

307
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,906
it more fun.

308
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,657
Here we go.

309
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,783
For reward.

310
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,410
Survivors ready?

311
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,830
Go!

312
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,956
Who's going to square off

313
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,666
against who?

314
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,625
Joel knocks Yau-Man and takes

315
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:50,298

James pulls Kathy off Cirie.

318
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,806

That was the biggest collision

Fans have three bags, favorites

353
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,129

You need five to win.

355
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:15,674

00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:07,893
Favorites now have four bags.

385
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,521
They need just one more.

386
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,689
Favorites have their hands on

387
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,108
that fifth and final bag.

388
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,735
Penner fighting for it!

389
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,654
Penner's got it!

390
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,990
This will do it!

391
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:26,328
Favorites win reward!

392
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:31,417
A huge battle comes to an end.

393
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,044
>> Oh, my God!

394
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,129
>> PROBST: Nice work.

395
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,505
Now you must choose one member

396
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,090
from the fans tribe to go to

397
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,258
Exile Island.

398
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:39,925
Who are you going to send to

399
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:40,134
Exile?

400
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,428
>> We're going to send KB.

401
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,512
>> PROBST: Kathy, you don't look

402
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,096
pleased at all with that news.

403
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,223
>> No.

404
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,558
>> PROBST: Now who are you going

405
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,684
to send from your own tribe?

406
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,560
Ami, you're excited to go to

407
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,644
Exile?

408
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:51,479
>> I am-- second clue.

409
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,104
>> PROBST: All right, Kathy and

410
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,939
Ami head out.

411
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,608
Boat's waiting for you.

412
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,610
You will rejoin your tribe at

413
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,361
the next immunity challenge.

414
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,821
All right, fans, got nothing for

415
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,239
you.

416
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,073
Grab your stuff, head back to

417
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,825
camp.

418
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,035
>> Good job, guys.

419
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:06,994
>> Good job, guys.

420
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:07,870
Hell of a battle.

421
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,622
>> PROBST: Favorites,

422
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:10,581
congratulations.

423
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:11,707
You have shelter, a lighting

424
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,334
kit, and a survival kit.

425
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,210
Come get your stuff, head back

426
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,670
to camp.

427
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,853
>> The nice girl, we got tangled

428
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,522
up, and she's like, "So do you

429
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,523
have a girlfriend?"

430
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,106
>> Well, Mike had both me and

431
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,692
Amanda.

432
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,528
He had two of us, like, wrapped

433
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,153
up, and we were both struggling

434
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,113
to get free, and he's like, "I'd

435
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,407
like to stay like this all day."

436
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,660
>> Holy crap.

437
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:48,911
That was like the hardest thing

438
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,622
I've ever done.

439
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:02,758
>> I don't know if the other

440
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:03,884
people feel relaxed because they

441
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,638
feel secure in their alliances,

442
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,641
but I don't feel relaxed at all.

443
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,142
I feel like I have to

444
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,019
continuously scramble to make

445
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,437
sure everything works in my

446
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,064
favor.

447
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,616
>> You were just terminating,

448
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,200
like, throwing people left and

449
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,910
right.

450
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:34,915
I was very impressed.

451
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,333
>> Because I am in the middle

452
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,042
right now, I have to look at

453
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,337
every option or every scenario

454
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,006
that could possibly happen and

455
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:46,468
try to have a plan B.

456
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,929
If I was in their position, I

457
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:49,930
think they could do a little

458
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,517
more for me, actually.

459
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,644
No one's washing my clothes.

460
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,021
I haven't gotten any special

461
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,439
meals.

462
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,064
I think if they really wanted my

463
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,275
vote, they should probably do a

464
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,234
little more.

465
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,444
I should probably be carried,

466
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:06,405
like, on a chariot-type thing.

467
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,254
All right, ladies, I'm just

468
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,131
feeling a little bit nervous,

469
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,634
and it's only because of the

470
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,802
relationships that you already

471
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,512
have with James and you, Amanda,

472
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,306
have with Ozzy.

473
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,098
But, Parvati, this James thing

474
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,143
just kind of developed.

475
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,068
>> Right.

476
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:47,154
>> That's the thing...

477
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:49,281
>> I know.

478
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,866
>> I'm just going to put it out

479
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:51,492
there.

480
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,201
I like flirting with Ozzy.

481
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,243
So if that makes you

482
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,203
uncomfortable, then I'll, like,

483
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,204
stop, but...

484
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,038
>> No, no, no, no, don't change.

485
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:56,997
>> No, because that's the way

486
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,499
you keep him close, you know?

487
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,958
And he doesn't asks questions.

488
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,754
James asks me no questions.

489
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:04,380
>> Are you nervous about her?

490
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,800
>> No, I'm not.

491
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:08,967
>> She's like me a little.

492
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,052
She gets paranoid.

493
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,970
She needs to be reassured a lot.

494
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,097
>> Let's reassure her.

495
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:13,347
>> Okay.

496
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,765
But they're out there filling

497
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,350
her head with lies.

498
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,643
>> I want to vote Yau.

499
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,811
>> You want to vote Yau?

500
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:19,895
>> Because if Yau goes to Exile

501
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:20,270
Island one time...

502
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,730
>> Oh, yeah.

503
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,398
>> Going up against Yau...

504
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,357
>> You'll never win.

505
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,066
>> Yeah.

506
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,109
>> So I have both of you guys'

507
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,151
word that it's us three to the

508
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,945
end.

509
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:28,445
>> Yes.

510
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:28,696
>> Yeah.

511
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,988
>> I don't care if James

512
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,657
proposes to you or you and Ozzy

513
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,866
have little Ozzlets.

514
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,951
>> Oh, you know how I am.

515
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,119
>> All right.

516
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,663
>> So we'll talk to her.

517
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:38,497
They're filling her head with

518
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,206
stuff.

519
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,709
She's the swing vote, I guess.

520
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,334
And why would she swing over to

521
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,337
them unless she thinks that she

522
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,422
should be the queen bee over

523
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,506
there?

524
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,549
>> Yeah, but she's not.

525
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:49,174
She won't be.

526
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,135
>> Well, exactly.

527
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,052
>> I hope she doesn't fall for

528
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,180
their garbage.

529
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,104
>> What's it say?

530
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,188
>> It says-- okay, listen good--

531
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,233
"Continue your quest by crossing

532
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,484
the ocean."

533
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,444
>> I'm here on Exile Island

534
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,737
again.

535
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,362
Right away, Ami wanted to go to

536
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,030
the other island.

537
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,907
After having been to that island

538
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:14,450
many times with Cirie, I'm

539
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,910
like... because Cirie and I

540
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,162
found all four clues.

541
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,873
>> It says, "Cross the ocean."

542
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:21,915
So that's what we've done

543
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:22,166
before.

544
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,042
>> Yeah.

545
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,961
Ami saw the clue up in the tree,

546
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:28,047
and she could not figure it out,

547
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,631
but I had to play dumb, you

548
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,258
know, like, "I don't know."

549
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,259
I was just exhausted, and I

550
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:32,801
wasn't about to go island

551
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,262
hopping again.

552
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:38,640
>> I think we should, because

553
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,142
the tide's coming in, not out.

554
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,144
>> The waves started getting

555
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,479
choppy.

556
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,605
I said to Ami, "Uh-oh."

557
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,898
I'm no weatherman, but the

558
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:46,482
clouds, everything, it looked

559
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,067
like a big storm was coming in.

560
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,152
So pretty much clue searching

561
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,654
had to come to an end.

562
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,542
>> Oh, my God!

563
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,962
>> Oh, mother of God.

564
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,674
>> This is insane.

565
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,968
>> It's pouring down rain.

566
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,220
Our shelter sucks.

567
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,055
Everyone's freezing.

568
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,014
Everyone's cold.

569
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:20,974
Everyone's sopping wet.

570
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,309
Not much you can do.

571
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:25,229
>> Oh, wow, it sucks in here.

572
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,147
>> It sprinkled last night.

573
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,317
Tonight it's a monsoon.

574
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,820
Oh, right on my face!

575
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,284
>> Yay, victory!

576
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:44,873
>> Oh, yeah!

577
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,583
>> Came up to the cave and

578
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,585
settled down for a nice sleep.

579
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,712
The rain is falling really,

580
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,756
really, really, really hard, the

581
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,382
hardest since we've been here.

582
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,383
>> We're totally covered.

583
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,344
Oh, my God, this is so great.

584
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:01,014
>> This is amazing.

585
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,349
>> Oh!

586
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,600
>> And I kind of feel bad for

587
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,476
the whole Airai tribe.

588
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,353
I know that they are probably

589
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,314
not doing well right now.

590
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,078
>> I'm sure the other tribe is

591
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:24,413
doing really well, staying dry

592
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,582
and probably laughing about us

593
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,667
right now having to endure this

594
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,753
wicked storm.

595
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,715
I just hope no spiders get me--

596
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,593
or scorpions or rats.

597
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,699
>> Last night was probably the

598
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:01,325
worst night that we've had since

599
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,410
we've been here.

600
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,454
It rained all night, and the

601
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,916
shelter didn't do one single bit

602
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,418
of good.

603
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:16,214
>> Oh, God!

604
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,966
>> This morning, we feel like we

605
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,593
got beat up twice yesterday--

606
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:20,969
once by the other tribe and once

607
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,056
by nature.

608
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,104
>> Glorious evening, huh?

609
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:37,903
>> I didn't sleep at all.

610
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:38,570
Did y'all?

611
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:38,779
>> No.

612
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,323
>> No.

613
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,450
>> My fingers are prune-y from

614
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:44,993
it being so wet.

615
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,913
>> Oh, I know.

616
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,290
>> I bet the water is warmer.

617
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,251
How did you sleep on the boat?

618
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,086
>> Huh?

619
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:54,711
>> How did you sleep on the

620
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:55,545
boat?

621
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,047
>> Oh, fine.

622
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:57,631
>> Not the sort of night you

623
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:58,507
want to have before a challenge,

624
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,926
and this one's for immunity.

625
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,928
I think that people are pretty

626
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:03,428
demoralized right now.

627
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:07,057
We cannot lose today.

628
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,065
>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!

629
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,658
We'll now bring in Ami and

630
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:25,659
Kathy, returning from Exile

631
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:29,496
Island.

632
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,958
(<i> applause</i> )

633
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:33,542
>> We had to just sleep in the

634
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,502
rain.

635
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:38,505
>> Love you guys.

636
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:39,798
>> PROBST: Ready to get to it?

637
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:40,799
>> Yeah.

638
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,134
>> PROBST: First things first.

639
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,051
I know you're hiding that idol

640
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:43,844
back there, Amanda.

641
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:44,511
>> I know.

642
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,846
I'm trying to keep it from you.

643
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:49,349
We'll get it back.

644
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,143
>> PROBST: Once again, immunity

645
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,352
is back up for grabs.

646
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,354
For today's challenge, each

647
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,939
tribe will choose two men and

648
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:56,982
two women.

649
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:57,566
Their job will be to hold to a

650
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,402
very heavy rope net while

651
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,945
members of the other tribe

652
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,114
attempt to shoot coconuts into

653
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,907
the net.

654
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,242
The more coconuts you get into

655
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:08,452
the other tribe's net, the

656
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:11,246
heavier that net will become.

657
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:12,330
The tribe that holds on the

658
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,708
longest wins immunity,

659
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,084
guaranteed at least one more

660
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:16,543
night in this game.

661
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,670
Losers go to tribal council.

662
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,298
Somebody will be voted out.

663
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,758
Give you a minute to strategize.

664
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,260
We'll get started.

665
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:27,387
Here we go.

666
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,223
Holding the net for the fans:

667
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,143
Erik, Natalie, Tracy, and Joel.

668
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,269
For the favorites: Parvati,

669
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,188
James, Jonathan Penner, and

670
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,898
Cirie.

671
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,150
Survivors ready?

672
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,526
Go.

673
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,986
>> Come on, Ozzy.

674
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:43,779
>> PROBST: Ozzy and Mikey B. up

675
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,156
first.

676
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,574
Learning curve.

677
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,534
You want to get as many coconuts

678
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:50,577
in the other tribe's net as you

679
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,955
can.

680
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,123
Jason connects for the fans.

681
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:55,457
>> Good job.

682
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,334
>> PROBST: The more coconuts,

683
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,168
the heavier that net will

684
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,503
become.

685
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,047
>> God, that's heavy.

686
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,340
>> PROBST: A little harder to

687
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:03,882
throw a coconut than you'd

688
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,717
think.

689
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,845
Alexis connects for the fans.

690
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,932
Eliza just misses.

691
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,184
>> Come on, Amanda!

692
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:14,643
>> You almost got it!

693
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,479
>> That wasn't correct, Amanda.

694
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,939
>> PROBST: Jason showing them

695
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,108
how it's done.

696
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,234
Yau-Man finally breaks the

697
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,693
spell.

698
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:24,486
Favorites are on the board.

699
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:28,490
Kathy just misses for the fans.

700
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,200
Ami gets one in.

701
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:33,954
Now the favorites are on a roll.

702
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:34,955
Alexis drills another one.

703
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:35,705
>> Yeah, you're good, little

704
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:35,872
one.

705
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:36,623
>> PROBST: Eliza goes underhand.

706
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:39,584
>> Yeah, Eliza!

707
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:40,794
>> PROBST: Chet!

708
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,337
Nobody missing.

709
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,922
>> Sweet lord, Chet!

710
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:48,009
Yes, Ozzy!

711
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,636
Yes!

712
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:50,929
Come on, Kathy, show us how it's

713
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,682
done in Wisconsin.

714
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,143
Chet, we're at a pageant

715
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:59,729
and... Chet!

716
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:00,647
>> PROBST: Penner talking a lot

717
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,484
of trash-- just what we expect.

718
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,068
>> Nice shot there, squirrely

719
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,236
boy.

720
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,195
>> PROBST: Reminds me of the

721
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,406
Cook Islands.

722
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,041
Nets starting to get heavier

723
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,918
now.

724
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,128
How's it going, James?

725
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:23,920
>> I'm chillin'.

726
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:24,671
>> PROBST: Yeah.

727
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:29,342
>> Always.

728
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,719
>> PROBST: Fans having to

729
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,721
readjust a little bit.

730
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,139
>> Come on, guys.

731
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,223
Let's speed it up.

732
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,558
>> Come on, Oz.

733
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:36,766
Nice.

734
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,476
>> PROBST: Ozzy puts another one

735
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,227
in.

736
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:39,978
Jason banks another one for the

737
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,688
fans.

738
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:42,606
Amanda connects.

739
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,608
Kathy connects.

740
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:45,942
>> Nice shot, Kathy.

741
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:46,818
>> PROBST: Everybody putting

742
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,778
coconuts in the net.

743
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:49,654
Weight starting to get heavy

744
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,073
now.

745
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,408
Starting to show.

746
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:56,786
Starting to take its toll now.

747
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,246
>> Yeah!

748
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,122
>> PROBST: Parvati, James,

749
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,290
Penner, and Cirie now starting

750
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,834
to struggle a bit.

751
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,253
>> Sink it, Mike!

752
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,129
>> PROBST: Fans starting to put

753
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:06,922
some weight in that favorites

>> Come on, guys.

758
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:20,602
You got to sink those.

759

Penner, Cirie struggling.

761
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,607
Mikey B. adds more weight.

762
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,150
>> Just a couple more, guys--

763
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,151
couple more!

764
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:28,777
>> PROBST: James trying to hold

765
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:28,944
on.

Parvati trying to hold on.

767
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:31,613
Chet puts another one in for the

768
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,490
fans.

769
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,742
>> Hold it!

770
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,577
>> PROBST: That's it!

771
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,288
Fans win immunity!

772
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,832
(<i> fans cheering</i> )

773
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,292
>> That's what I'm talking

774
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,794
about.

775
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,671
>> We won!

776
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,464
>> Oh, my god!

777
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:49,798
>> PROBST: Fans,

778
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,634
congratulations.

779

(<i> cheering and applause</i> )

780
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:56,763
>> All right!

781
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:58,723
>> PROBST: Immunity, nobody

782
00:25:58,807 --> 00:25:59,975
going home, nobody going to

783
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,559
tribal council.

784
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,894
Favorites, you know the drill.

785
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,229
Tribal council, one of you will

786
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:04,646
be voted out.

787
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,647
Grab your stuff, head back to

788
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,109
camp.

789
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,208
>> Today we lost the immunity

790
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,794
challenge, which sucks.

791
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:30,005
It was hard enough just coming

792
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:30,630
back from Exile Island after the

793
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:33,258
night that I had, but then

794
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,468
coming back, losing a challenge,

795
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,386
and having to go to tribal

796
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,888
council tonight-- I mean, does

797
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,474
it get worse on<i> Survivor?</i>

798
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:48,356
>> She's sleeping with James,

799
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,317
and we can't have it.

800
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,276
You know, we just can't have

801
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,402
that.

802
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:52,819
I'm sorry.

803
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,654
It's a dumb play on her part.

804
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,864
Do you agree?

805
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,824
>> All right.

806
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:58,408
>> And we're cool, right, you

807
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,367
and me?

808
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,118
>> We're cool.

809
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:00,952
>> I think we should just stick

810
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:01,286
with the plan.

811
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,954
>> Okay, stick with the plan,

812
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,040
stick with the plan.

813
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:11,880
>> Cirie wants Yau-Man gone,

814
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,798
so... we need her.

815
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,843
>> Yeah, but that's her play.

816
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:19,846
>> And he's going to go to Exile

817
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:20,847
before the next immunity

818
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:21,723
challenge.

819
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,767
There's just a strong

820
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:24,309
possibility it's going to

821
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:24,851
happen.

822
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,270
>> Yeah, but still...

823
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,063
>> And I know they want to vote

824
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,022
me out.

825
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,065
>> Yeah, they're after your ass,

826
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,108
baby.

827
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,194
>> Better not!

828
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,785
>> I just... I feel like Eliza

829
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:42,786
would be a better choice.

830
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:43,244
Yau-Man's stronger.

831
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,496
>> Eliza, we can get rid of

832
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:44,829
Eliza any day.

833
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,123
>> I know, but if we keep Yau-

834
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,833
Man, the chances of having a

835
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,919
good run at an immunity

836
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,754
challenge are better.

837
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,589
Eliza is not good at challenges.

838
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:55,090
>> He's out for himself.

839
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:55,757
>> I swear, we can vote Eliza

840
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,675
next.

841
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,426
>> And he'll sneak by.

842
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,469
>> We can, anybody you want, but

843
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:01,346
I cannot stay here and see him

844
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:02,972
find another idol and not be

845
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,265
able to go, and I thought we

846
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:04,849
were all cool on that.

847
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,519
>> What do you think?

848
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,270
>> Yeah, I mean, if you guys

849
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:09,729
really feel that way.

850
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,065
>> I feel.

851
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:12,941
>> Which one?

852
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:13,817
>> Yau.

853
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,529
>> Or Jonathan, either one.

854
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:18,947
>> What's going on, dudes?

855
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,490
>> What's up, man?

856
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:21,116
>> I didn't mean to break up the

857
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,242
party.

858
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,827
>> Oh, you didn't.

859
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,704
>> You all right?

860
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:27,330
>> Okay, we're going to do some

861
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:30,041
girl stuff.

862
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,756
>> Me or Yau?

863
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,841
So who's she voting for, me or

864
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:38,758
Yau?

865
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,010
>> I don't know.

866
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:41,761
>> Just tell me, is it me or is

867
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,221
it Yau?

868
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:43,888
>> I don't know.

869
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:44,848
They're trying to decide.

870
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:45,849
That's what they were talking

871
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,308
about when you walked up.

872
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,143
>> I'm starting to feel a little

873
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,310
antsy about the vote, only

874
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,271
because I'd like to believe that

875
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:51,813
Cirie is tight with us, but

876
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,107
obviously Amanda and Parvati

877
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,567
have been pouring a lot of BS

878
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,985
into her ear, and you know, you

879
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,904
have to hope that Cirie is, I

880
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,197
don't know, smart enough, loyal

881
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,657
enough, happy enough to stick

882
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,159
with our group.

883
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,160
It's going to be the five of us

884
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,578
to vote off Parvati because

885
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,163
she's got these two guys wrapped

886
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:11,583
around her finger.

887
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,709
It's that simple.

888
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:13,835
Now, I don't know what they've

889
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,545
said to you about our

890
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:16,880
trustworthiness or our desire to

891
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:17,839
vote you out.

892
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:18,756
I don't know what they've said,

893
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,299
okay?

894
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:20,049
>> Uh-huh.

895
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,134
>> It's not true.

896
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:24,220
Please, because we've been a

897
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,513
solid five.

898
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,014
The plan is a good one.

899
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,057
It's simply not true.

900
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,893
>> Those two pairs together--

901
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,478
right?-- forms a core four.

902
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,645
>> You know, I hear that.

903
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:33,480
>> There's no way you could work

904
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,522
yourself into it.

905
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,315
I mean, as soon as they've got

906
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:35,940
the vote, they're going to take

907
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:36,191
you out.

908
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,650
>> But you know what, Yau?

909
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:38,568
The same argument that you're

910
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:39,861
using, they use the same

911
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,029
argument.

912
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,280
So why should I believe this one

913
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,239
over that one?

914
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,032
>> I'm not going to use an

915
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:44,282
argument.

916
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:45,658
I'm going to use common sense.

917
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:46,534
>> Uh-huh.

918
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,869
>> Honestly, the five of us

919
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,413
should march forward together.

920
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:50,955
There's no reason not to.

921
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,749
We have... I have no hidden

922
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:53,541
agenda.

923
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,167
I have no interest in voting any

924
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,960
of the four of you out.

925
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,754
That's the god's honest truth.

926
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,297
>> I know that you and Yau have

927
00:29:59,380 --> 00:29:59,881
y'all little thing, and if you

928
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:00,882
want to stand here and say that

929
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,675
y'all don't...

930
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:03,384
>> But there's only the two of

931
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:03,885
us.

932
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:04,260
>> Cirie, Cirie...

933
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,678
>> Okay.

934
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:06,387
>> Hold on, hold on, hold on.

935
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,055
>> That's my thing.

936
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:07,805
That's my thing.

937
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:08,473
>> I appreciate that.

938
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:09,182
I appreciate that.

939
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:09,557
>> Keep it real.

940
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,558
>> Let's keep it real.

941
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,226
>> Yeah.

942
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:11,935
>> I think that you and I have a

943
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,436
little thing, okay?

944
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,062
I think that Ami and I have a

945
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,605
little thing.

946
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:16,564
It's ridiculous!

947
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,065
>> Call it what you want.

948
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,650
>> I'm going to.

949
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:19,442
I'm going to.

950
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,151
>> And being like that is not

951
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:20,902
really going to get my vote,

952
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:21,778
seriously.

953
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:22,904
>> Listen, wait a second.

954
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,781
We have a long way to go.

955
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:25,323
It's day...

956
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,032
>> I know.

957
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:26,282
I played.

958
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:26,908
Just like you played, I played

959
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:27,909
too.

960
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,203
How far did you go?

961
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:30,954
>> I don't know, maybe not as

962
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:31,246
far as you.

963
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:31,913
>> I've seen everybody.

964
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,123
I may look like I'm laughing and

965
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,166
joking and playing, but I'm

966
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,876
watching everybody, and I know

967
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,503
that what you have... I know

968
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:39,504
there's no way you would vote

969
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:40,004
him out before me.

970
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,298
I know it ain't.

971
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:42,966
>> I don't... you know what?

972
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,050
I thought we were solid.

973
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,093
And they've come up, and they've

974
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,178
said stuff to you that has put

975
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:47,971
doubt into your mind.

976
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,098
But I have not done anything to

977
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:50,890
you to put that doubt into your

978
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,642
mind.

979
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:53,977
>> I just...

980
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,061
>> I'm trying... you know, you

981
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,438
want to keep it real.

982
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,523
I'm trying to keep it real.

983
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,774
>> I have, I have.

984
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:00,525
This is why we're having this

985
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,234
conversation.

986
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,860
>> Well, I am keeping it real.

987
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,530
We're having a conversation.

988
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:11,744
>> I'm going to change, and I'm

989
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:12,370
going to think, and I just need,

990
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,455
like, five minutes without all

991
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,208
the stuff.

992
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:21,045
(<i> Cirie sighing</i> )

993
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,005
>> I mean, let's take Yau-Man

994
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,172
out tonight if that's the way

995
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,591
it's got to be, but Parvati...

996
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,258
>> I don't think that's a good

997
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:25,466
idea.

998
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,759
>> I don't think so either.

999
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:27,677
So who's it going to be?

1000
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,303
>> I think Eliza is the obvious

1001
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,387
choice.

1002
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,763
>> All right.

1003
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:31,889
>> If you guys were to vote for

1004
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:32,724
Parvati, it's going to be

1005
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,225
throwing votes away, and it will

1006
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,602
be Yau-Man who goes home,

1007
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:36,227
because they will have numbers.

1008
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,229
>> You know, I hear what you're

1009
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,272
saying about your relationship

1010
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,232
with her, you know, but I'm

1011
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,484
talking about the fact that

1012
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,153
she's got you in her corner, and

1013
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,279
she's got James, and it's

1014
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,155
dangerous.

1015
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,906
You know, Eliza's not a threat.

1016
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:49,532
I mean, you're right, she's the

1017
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,242
weakest link, but she's also the

1018
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:51,951
least threatening link.

1019
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,745
You know what I mean?

1020
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:54,662
I mean, that's just the way I've

1021
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,872
been think about it, but I can

1022
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,081
rethink it, I guess.

1023
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:57,957
>> Cirie is not going to change

1024
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,834
her vote.

1025
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:02,170
She's voting for Yau.

1026
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,088
>> That's fine.

1027
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,007
>> We have to vote with her.

1028
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:06,549
>> I'm not... I'm voting for

1029
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,009
Eliza.

1030
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,052
I have to.

1031
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,720
I think that's the right thing

1032
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:11,054
to do.

1033
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,097
I think that to keep us strong

1034
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,558
is to vote out Eliza.

1035
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:16,184
>> But Cirie's not budging on

1036
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,061
Yau.

1037
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,687
She's voting Yau-Man.

1038
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,605
If we don't...

1039
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:21,856
>> We don't need Cirie.

1040
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:22,940
>> If we don't vote with her...

1041
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:23,274
>> Then what?

1042
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,025
>> ...she's not going to...

1043
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,068
she'll never trust us.

1044
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:27,028
>> Who's she going to trust,

1045
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,780
someone other than the five of

1046
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:32,158
us?

1047
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,159
>> I just don't think it's a

1048
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,494
good thing if we vote different

1049
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,620
people.

1050
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:36,621
I just think we all need to vote

1051
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:37,121
the same person.

1052
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,164
>> I don't think it's good, too,

1053
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,916
that she's, like, setting this

1054
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:40,750
decision.

1055
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:41,292
Like, what's up with that?

1056
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,043
>> I don't think that's right.

1057
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,795
>> Next time it's going to be

1058
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:44,295
all her decision, too?

1059
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:44,504
>> No.

1060
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:45,755
>> You see what I'm saying,

1061
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:46,464
though?

1062
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:47,173
Like, I didn't like that.

1063
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,258
>> I agree.

1064
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,009
Let's talk to her right now.

1065
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,219
>> Who?

1066
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:55,348
>> Cirie.

1067
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,225
>> What?

1068
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,852
>> All five of us need to talk.

1069
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:00,853
>> The more that I think about

1070
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,313
it, the more it seems like it

1071
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,691
makes more sense to vote Eliza.

1072
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,275
>> Eliza, please?

1073
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,443
Please, please.

1074
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,695
>> Come on, Cirie.

1075
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:09,654
>> Why is it so...

1076
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:10,571
>> Because we need the strength

1077
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,155
right now.

1078
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:11,572
>> For challenges.

1079
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,699
>> We're going to be on man

1080
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:13,408
short.

1081
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,158
>> It doesn't matter, but we all

1082
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:14,742
need to be on the same page as

1083
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:15,868
far as the five of us.

1084
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:16,994
>> I really... honestly, I don't

1085
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:17,495
want to change my vote.

1086
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,622
I don't feel threatened by Eliza

1087
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:20,248
at all.

1088
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,999
>> That's not sticking together,

1089
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:22,834
though.

1090
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,252
>> My vote has never changed.

1091
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,963
Your votes changed.

1092
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,423
>> Cirie is killing me.

1093
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,132
You can't be the boss of

1094
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,341
everything, and everybody just

1095
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,759
let her go, let her go, and let

1096
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,593
her go.

1097
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,886
She went from the swing vote to

1098
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:34,470
the one who's deciding what's

1099
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,264
going on for the whole group.

1100
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,516
That can't happen.

1101
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,350
This feels like I'm in China

1102
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,309
again, messing with a bunch of

1103
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,186
dumbasses.

1104
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,229
>> I'm not sure we can't still

1105
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,856
get Parvati out with four.

1106
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,399
I'm not sure.

1107
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,859
Because they're split between...

1108
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,987
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1109
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,071
>> Some folks want to vote for

1110
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,657
Yau, and some folks want to vote

1111
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,617
for you.

1112
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,201
Four votes for her may be

1113
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,871
enough.

1114
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:00,580
>> They're not going to go into

1115
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:01,664
tribal split.

1116
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:02,832
That's the dumbest thing ever.

1117
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,751
They're not that stupid.

1118
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:05,793
>> They were kind of talking

1119
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:06,919
like they might.

1120
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:07,503
>> Craziness, craziness before

1121
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,130
the vote.

1122
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,256
Well, the four of us, the

1123
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,841
remaining four of the five, not

1124
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,009
including Cirie, are going to

1125
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:16,679
stay tight and vote for Parvati.

1126
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,181
>> What's going on?

1127
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,141
>> Because right now, the other

1128
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,851
group, including Cirie, are

1129
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:22,810
split.

1130
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:23,978
Some of them want to vote Eliza

1131
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:25,938
out as the weakest link.

1132
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,273
Some of them want to vote Yau-

1133
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:28,858
Man out as either the weakest

1134
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:29,442
link or the biggest threat.

1135
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,068
I'm not sure why they would vote

1136
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,279
Yau-Man out.

1137
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,363
Come on, go be productive.

1138
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,740
You're being paranoid.

1139
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,617
If we can keep them split, if we

1140
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,785
can keep them from coming to a

1141
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,454
consensus, our four votes would

1142
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:42,663
actually be enough to get

1143
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,247
Parvati out.

1144
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,583
Our four votes may actually win

1145
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,959
the day.

1146
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:47,794
That's what I'm hoping for,

1147
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,420
fingers crossed.

1148
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,231
>> PROBST: Penner, got to ask,

1149
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:08,856
how disappointing is it to be

1150
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,025
back here?

1151
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:11,400
>> It's terrible.

1152
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,861
After that big victory yesterday

1153
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:14,987
that felt so great and so

1154
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,656
earned, today was a tough day

1155
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,324
after that loss.

1156
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,534
>> PROBST: James, do the fans

1157
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,828
earn a bit of respect from you

1158
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:22,453
guys that they are here to play

1159
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,330
as well?

1160
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,581
>> Yeah, they have definitely

1161
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,541
earned some respect.

1162
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:27,792
They got a little more hunger in

1163
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:28,876
them.

1164
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,503
We're dry, and we have food, and

1165
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:31,462
I guess it's made us kind of

1166
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:32,505
soft.

1167
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,756
We do need to win and make sure

1168
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,882
that the favorites are on the

1169
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:35,424
top at the end, and they're

1170
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:36,342
winning right now, and I don't

1171
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,761
like it.

1172
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:39,595
>> PROBST: Yau-Man, have you

1173
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,763
isolated a problem why you're

1174
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,598
losing?

1175
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,933
>> We need to really, really be

1176
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,268
hungry for the win.

1177
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:46,853
Whenever we won anything, we

1178
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:47,395
were all very happy for, you

1179
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,981
know, a day, and then once we

1180
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:50,565
lost, happened to be the more

1181
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,109
critical ones, and I feel very

1182
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,318
vulnerable every time we lose.

1183
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,153
>> PROBST: Penner, there's two

1184
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,446
ideas going on early in the

1185
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,865
game.

1186
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,157
Is this more about "Let's all

1187
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,325
try to stay together," or is it

1188
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,952
"I'm going to win this game, one

1189
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,704
way or another"?

1190
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,122
>> I think some of us would like

1191
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,624
to stay together and make this

1192
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,251
tribe as strong as possible.

1193
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,878
And I think that some of us are

1194
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,963
making moves already to

1195
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,131
eliminate people that they

1196
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,257
consider threats to them and

1197
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,427
take control of the game.

1198
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,386
>> PROBST: Cirie, where are you

1199
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,220
sitting on this?

1200
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,680
>> For me, Jeff, I'm looking at

1201
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:25,099
it as far as the tribe and as

1202
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:26,350
far as myself in this game.

1203
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:29,103
And if I'm not playing the game

1204
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:30,396
that's going to benefit you the

1205
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,440
most, it doesn't mean that I'm

1206
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,649
not doing what's best for the

1207
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,234
tribe.

1208
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,235
>> PROBST: Penner, you had a lot

1209
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:36,736
of reactions during that

1210
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,195
comment.

1211
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:38,779
>> I mean, she's made a move

1212
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,698
today that will advance her in

1213
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:41,949
the game and put her in a power

1214
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,159
position, and I don't think

1215
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,202
anybody believes that voting out

1216
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,245
the person that she wants to

1217
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,371
vote out is going to make the

1218
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,539
tribe stronger.

1219
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,373
>> For me, Jeff, had I made the

1220
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,250
move that he wanted me to make,

1221
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,418
we wouldn't even be having this

1222
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,670
conversation.

1223
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,504
>> I thought you were in an

1224
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,464
alliance, and you flopped, and

1225
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,840
then you brought everybody over.

1226
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:58,466
You did.

1227
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,425
>> Is this not the pot calling

1228
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,010
the kettle black?

1229
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:01,844
Whatever.

1230
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:02,511
>> I don't know.

1231
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,137
I thought I was in an alliance

1232
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,096
with you.

1233
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,264
Until today, I was.

1234
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,724
>> Jonathan, I came into your

1235
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,476
alliance as the fifth person,

1236
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,518
and I'm supposed to trust you.

1237
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:10,269
>> Were you in the alliance?

1238
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,228
Were you in the alliance?

1239
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,188
Did you say you were in the

1240
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,189
alliance and working with us and

1241
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,106
that we were solid and all that?

1242
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:14,899
You did.

1243
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:15,566
>> I did, I did.

1244
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,150
>> Okay, that's all I want to

1245
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:16,984
say.

1246
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:17,777
>> I did, but I don't trust you,

1247
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,612
point blank, period.

1248
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:20,529
>> And now you've asked everyone

1249
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:21,739
else to help you vote off the

1250
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,157
person that is a threat...

1251
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:23,741
>> I didn't ask anybody

1252
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:24,367
anything.

1253
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,117
>> Please.

1254
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,202
>> We all came to a decision to

1255
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,370
vote who we vote... who we're

1256
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:27,620
voting.

1257
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:28,955
>> Because you said you weren't

1258
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:29,747
going to vote for anybody else.

1259
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:30,373
That's the only person you were

1260
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,207
going to vote for.

1261
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:31,832
>> You told me the best thing

1262
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:32,708
for this tribe was to get rid of

1263
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:33,459
Parvati.

1264
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:33,960
>> I still believe that.

1265
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:34,585
>> And because I didn't do that,

1266
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,461
this is why we're having that

1267
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:37,213
conversation.

1268
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,089
>> I'm only trying to make moves

1269
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,090
to make this tribe stronger.

1270
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:39,966
>> I'm not doing what you want

1271
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:40,841
me to do.

1272
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,093
I don't trust you as far as I

1273
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:42,677
can pick you up and throw you.

1274
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,512
Sorry.

1275
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:45,429
And if you're upset that they

1276
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,264
trust me, too bad.

1277
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,557
>> I'm not upset.

1278
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,767
I'm upset that you are going to

1279
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,227
now be in the driver's seat.

1280
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,061
>> Because I'm not voting the

1281
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:52,561
way you want me to vote.

1282
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,437
>> Anybody can vote any way they

1283
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,189
want.

1284
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:55,898
>> They should.

1285
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:56,983
I don't have mind control over

1286
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:57,400
anybody here.

1287
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,568
So y'all all vote however you

1288
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,444
want to vote.

1289
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:01,362
>> Right, I would urge everyone

1290
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,905
to vote their conscience.

1291
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:03,531
Then we have some common ground

1292
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,324
that we can work from.

1293
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,409
Otherwise, it's going to be, I

1294
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:09,578
think, a much bigger split and

1295
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,080
kind of disastrous.

1296
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,039
So I'm hoping that people do

1297
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,000
vote the way they honestly

1298
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:14,917
believe this tribe is going to

1299
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,002
be the strongest.

1300
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,003
>> Everybody here knows it was

1301
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:17,878
split.

1302
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,631
>> Right.

1303
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:21,716
>> PROBST: Parvati, during this

1304
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:22,758
whole thing, you had a look on

1305
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:23,592
your face like "I just wish this

1306
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,261
would go away."

1307
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,303
>> Yeah.

1308
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,722
I mean, people are concerned

1309
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,348
that maybe I'm just flirting and

1310
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:32,393
manipulating other people to,

1311
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,728
you know, make alliances and get

1312
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,396
people on my side.

1313
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,023
So yeah, I know that my name has

1314
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,149
been brought up.

1315
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,483
And that scares me, but that

1316
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,194
doesn't surprise me at all.

1317
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:42,820
>> PROBST: Well, it sounds like

1318
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,613
however it goes down, it's going

1319
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:45,906
to be a very big vote for this

1320
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,782
tribe.

1321
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:47,450
Let's get to it.

1322
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:47,908
It is time to vote.

1323
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,453
Amanda, you're up.

1324
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,092
>> I have nothing against you,

1325
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,261
Parvati, but I think that by

1326
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:08,679
following Cirie, you have signed

1327
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,139
your own death warrant.

1328
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:10,765
She's led you like a sheep to

1329
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,391
the slaughter and played you

1330
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:12,725
like a fiddle.

1331
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,728
I'm sorry for you.

1332
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:37,541
>> You aligning with the biggest

1333
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,252
liar in the game made me feel

1334
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,712
like strategically this was the

1335
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:42,838
best move for me.

1336
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,341
Sorry.

1337
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:46,634
>> PROBST: I'll go tally the

1338
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,428
votes.

1339
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:58,729
If anybody has the hidden

1340
00:39:58,813 --> 00:39:59,522
immunity idol, now is the time

1341
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:03,567
to play it.

1342
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,485
Once votes are read, the

1343
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,153
decision is final.

1344
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,321
Person voted out will be asked

1345
00:40:07,404 --> 00:40:08,364
to leave the tribal council area

1346
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:08,656
immediately.

1347
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:12,910
I'll read the votes.

1348
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,745
First vote, Parvati.

1349
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,168

Yau-Man.

1351
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:28,050
That's two votes Yau-Man.

1352
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:31,095

1353
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,054

Two votes Parvati, two votes

1357
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,398
Yau-Man, one vote Cirie.

1358

Yau-Man.

1359
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:47,278

00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,613
votes Parvati, one vote Cirie.

1361

votes Parvati, one vote Cirie.

<i>vs. Favorites,</i> Yau-Man.

1366
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,340
That's five.

1367
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:08,966
That's enough.

1368
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,885
You need to bring me your torch.

1369
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,095
>> Great playing with you.

1370
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,555
Don't worry.

1371
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,224
Don't cry.

1372
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,107
>> PROBST: Yau-Man, the tribe

1373
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:28,194
has spoken.

1374
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,361
Time for you to go.

1375
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,404
>> Good luck, you guys.

1376
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:31,655
Have fun.

1377
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,167
>> PROBST: Well, the problem

1378
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,294
with this tribe is no secret.

1379
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,629
You guys are divided.

1380
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,005
Big question is what are you

1381
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:48,631
going to do about it?

1382
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,341
Grab your torches.

1383
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:51,217
Head back to camp.

1384
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,552
Good night.

have to say.

1397

>> What did I ever do to you

1398
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:14,615
except ask you to be in an

1399
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:14,990
alliance with me?

>> You know that I broke your

1403
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:18,702
alliance, done.

1404
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,538
>> You said you were going to

1405
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,121
get Mike off a long time okay.

1406

head off.

>> PROBST: ...and an Exile

1411
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:27,878
Island that can't be missed.

1412
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:35,386
>> No hard feelings.

1413
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:36,387
I had a great time.

1414
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:36,971
I was a very big target coming

1415
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:37,680
into this.

1416
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:40,057
You know, by virtue of me doing

1417
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,600
so well in Fiji, I consider

1418
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,810
myself lucky.

1419
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:43,852
Many people want to get on

1420
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:45,354
<i>Survivor</i> once.

1421
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:46,772
Well, I've been on twice.

1422
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:48,232
But I wish I would have been in

1423
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:48,816
there longer.

1424
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,859
That's the way how this game is.

1425
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:51,944
It's a very cruel game, but

1426
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:54,029
that's the way it goes.
