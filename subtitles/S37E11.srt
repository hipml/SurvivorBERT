>> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON

00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,842
"SURVIVOR," AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
GABBY AND CHRISTIAN VOTED OUT A

3
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:10,009
DAVID.

4
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:13,446
CARL, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.

5
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,815
SHOCKING NICK, DAVIE, AND
ANGELINA.

6
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:17,317
EIGHT ARE LEFT.

7
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:20,387
WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?

8
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:31,998
>> WELL DONE, GUYS.

9
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:34,067
>> I KNEW YOU GUYS WERE LYING TO
ME.

10
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,169
>> LET ME TELL YOU, I WASN'T
LYING TO YOU.

11
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:37,937
>> DON'T UNDERESTIMATE ANYBODY.

12
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:39,139
>> NO, NO.

13
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:43,009
>> NEW YORK I'M SAYING, CARL WAS
THE GODFATHER.

14
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,644
>> I'M GLAD HE'S GONE.

15
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,580
>> TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS
A SHOCK TO ME.

16
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:50,950
CHRISTIAN AND GABBY VOTED OUT
CARL, AND I WAS BLIND SIDED.

17
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:52,752
I DON'T GET IT TOO.

18
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:54,120
THEY'RE SO SMART THEY'RE DUMB.

19
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,990
LIKE WHAT KIND OF MOVE IS THAT?

20
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:59,359
TRY TO MAKE ME UNDERSTAND WHY
CARL HAD TO GO TONIGHT.

21
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:02,128
>> OKAY, HERE'S THE THING.

22
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:05,265
>> I SAVED YOU FROM GOING VOTED
OUT THE OTHER DAY.

23
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:09,536
WE USED THREE ADVANTAGES TO GET
THE MAJORITY, AN YOU JUST GAVE

24
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:10,236
IT TO THEM.

25
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,005
>> WE DIDN'T GIVE THEM ANYTHING.

26
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:15,141
>> I REGRET SAVING CHRISTIAN.

27
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:18,011
WE BURNED EVERY ADVANTAGE WE HAD
TO GET DAVID LEAD, AND NOW HE

28
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:20,580
DOES THIS AND DOESN'T EVEN TELL
ME THE VOTE.

29
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:21,448
I'M PRETTY MAD.

30
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:23,650
WE'RE GOING TO BE NEXT, DUDE.

31
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:27,220
>> HOW THE HELL IS THAT
POSSIBLE?

32
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,289
>> GABBY, SHE...

33
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:31,491
>> I REALLY DON'T THINK GABBY IS
GOING TO FLIP.

34
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,026
>> SHE JUST DID, DUDE.

35
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:38,064
>> HONESTLY, EVERYONE WANTS
ALISON OUT.

36
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,200
SHE REALLY IS NEXT

37
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:44,404
>> IN MY MIND, THE MASON-DIXON
ALLIANCE IS DEAD.

38
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,906
I'M STILL GOING THE PLAY IT UP,
BUT I'M GOING TO REMEMBER, THIS

39
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:50,109
AND AS SOON AS I GET THE CHANCE,
I WON'T HESITATE "THE BLIND TO B

40
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,111
CHRISTIAN.

Captioning funded by CBS

42
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:06,626
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

43
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:14,534
ALL RIGHT.

44
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:19,072
31 DAYS IS A LONG TIME TO BE
AWAY FROM HOME.

45
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:19,939
>> YES.

46
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,674
>> Jeff: I'M NOT GOING TO BURY
THE LEAD.

47
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:22,942
IT'S TIME FOR SOME LOVE.

48
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,411
>> YEAH.

49
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,947
>> Jeff: DAVIE, YOU READY TO
SEE YOUR MOM?

50
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:28,848
>> OH, YES.

51
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,517
>> Jeff: HAZEL, COME ON OUT.

52
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,620
>> MAMA.

53
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:45,698
MOM!

54
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:47,901
>> OH.

55
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:51,404
>> Jeff: HAZEL, TELL ME ABOUT
DAVIE.

56
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,474
>> HE'S DAVIE CROCKETT FOR ONE
THING.

57
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,608
HE'S AN EXPLORER.

58
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:59,145
I WOULD BE IN MY HOUSE, WHERE IS
DAVIE?

59
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:03,616
HE'LL COME BACK WITH FROGS AND
SNAKES, SCARING THE DAYLIGHTS

60
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,485
OUT OF ME.

61
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:09,122
BUT ABOVE ALL OF THAT, HE'S SO
LOVING.

62
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,291
HE'S MY MOST LOVABLE KID.

63
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,025
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

64
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:13,259
GIVE HIM A LAST HUG.

65
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,961
>> OH, I LOVE YOU.

66
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,529
>> I LOVE YOU, TOO.

67
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,299
>> Jeff: HAZEL, YOU CAN TAKE A
SPOT RIGHT UP HERE ON THE BENCH.

68
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,901
>> OH, GOD.

69
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,037
>> Jeff: ALISON, LET'S GET
YOUR MOM OUT HERE.

70
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:38,618
WILLA, COME ON OUT.

71
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:44,991
THAT IS SOME MOM LOVE RIGHT
THERE.

72
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:49,729
ALISON, IS "SURVIVOR" PART OF
THE FAMILY EXPERIENCE OR JUST

73
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:50,997
YOURS?

74
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:55,234
>> I'M LIVING MY FAMILY'S DREAM
RIGHT NOW 100%, AND HONESTLY THE

75
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:58,738
REASON I'M OUT HERE IS BECAUSE
OF MY MOM, TO TAKE A LEAP OF

76
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:02,342
FAITH AND GO ON AN ADVENTURE
LIKE THIS IS OUTSIDE OF MY

77
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,744
COMFORT ZONE, AND IT'S BECAUSE
OF HER THAT I KNEW I HAD THE

78
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:05,778
STRENGTH TO DO IT.

79
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,146
>> Jeff: GIVE HER LAST HUG.

80
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:10,216
>> OH, MY GOD, I LOVE YOU, MOM.

81
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,421
>> Jeff: KARA, YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE READY FOR SOME LOVE.

82
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,956
LET'S GET YOUR BROTHER OUT HERE.

83
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:22,528
ERIC, COME ON OUT.

84
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:30,269
>> COME HERE.

85
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:31,537
>> OH, MY GOD.

86
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:35,742
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

87
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:39,946
>> Jeff: KARA, THE THING ABOUT
A BROTHER-SISTER RELATIONSHIP,

88
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,247
ONE OF YOU IS NOT THE PARENT.

89
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:44,951
IT'S A REALLY UNIQUE DYNAMIC IN
THE FAMILY.

90
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,855
>> I FEEL LIKE THE LIFE THAT
WE'VE LIVED TOGETHER IS LIKE THE

91
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,424
LIFE... IT'S SIMILAR TO
"SURVIVOR."

92
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,393
YOU CAN'T DESCRIBE IT, BUT IF
YOU'VE BEEN TO IT, IT BRINGS YOU

93
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,228
CLOSER THAN YOU COULD IMAGINE.

94
00:04:55,294 --> 00:05:00,500
WE HIT BOTTOM OUT HERE, AN I'M
SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE I WANT TO

95
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,169
CONSIDER MY FRIENDS, BUT I DON'T
KNOW WHAT THEIR INTENTIONS ARE,

96
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:10,109
BUT TO SEE YOU, I KNOW YOU LOVE
ME.

97
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:11,711
>> I'M HERE FOR YOU.

98
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,514
>> Jeff: GIVE HER LAST BIG
HUG.

99
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,949
>> I LOVE YOU SO MUCH AND I'M SO
PROUD OF YOU.

100
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,285
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, NICK.

101
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:20,987
YOU READY TO GET YOUR DAD OUT
HERE?

102
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:27,760
JIM, COME ON OUT.

103
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,829
>> HI.

104
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:39,706
>> Jeff: NICK, ONE THING I
NOTICED THERE IS THAT THE LITTLE

105
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,140
BOY CAME OUT.

106
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:44,410
I MEAN, YOU'RE A GRUN MAN, BUT
YOU SAW YOUR DAD WALKING DOWN,

107
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,079
AND IT JUST... YOU CHANGED.

108
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,447
DID YOU FEEL THAT?

109
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:51,350
>> ABSOLUTELY, AND THAT'S WHAT I
FELT OUT HERE.

110
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:55,021
I FEEL LIKE I DIDN'T ALWAYS
APPRECIATE HIM, AND, YOU KNOW,

111
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:59,959
GOING TO COLLEGE, MY FRIENDS
LIKE HAD THEIR DADS' CREDIT

112
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,862
CARDS AND DOVE THESE CARS AND
STUFF, AND I DIDN'T HAVE THAT.

113
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:07,767
I CALLED MY BROTHER ONE DAY, AND
I SAID, YOU KNOW, I BUSH WE HAD

114
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,001
MORE.

115
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:12,472
HE SAID, YOU DON'T REALIZE WHAT
DAD DOES FOR US UNTIL YOU HAVE

116
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,742
DONATED BLOOD THE BUY MILK FOR
FIVE KIDS, YOU DON'T REALIZE

117
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,243
WHAT THIS MAN HAS GONE THROUGH.

118
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,580
I JUST HAVE SO MUCH APPRECIATION
NOW FOR WHAT HE'S DONE FOR ME

119
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,949
AND ALL MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS
MY WHOLE LIFE.

120
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:26,753
>> IT AIN'T A MATTER ABOUT WHAT
YOU HAVE OR WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE,

121
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:30,022
IT'S ABOUT WHAT YOU GIVE, YOU
KNOW?

122
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:30,957
IT'S ABOUT THE LOVE.

123
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:31,791
>> Jeff: THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

124
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,092
GIVE HIM A LAST HUG.

125
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,395
>> I LOVE YOU.

126
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,631
>> Jeff: YOU'RE GETTING TO
LIVE YOUR DREAM.

127
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:39,465
AWESOME.

128
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,868
GABBY, YOU READY FOR SOME LOVE?

129
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:46,439
LET'S GET YOUR MOM OUT HERE.

130
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,206
ENCARNITA, COME OUT.

131
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:50,910
>> YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL, GIRL.

132
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:58,684
GABRIELLE.

133
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:02,588
>> Jeff: GABBY, CAN YOU FEEL
THE YOUNG WOMAN LET GO AND THE

134
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,191
LITTLE GIRL COME BACK, THAT THIS
IS MOM?

135
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,027
>> YEAH.

136
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,264
SHE ALWAYS SUPPORTS ME WHEN I'M
DOING MY WORRYING THING, WHICH

137
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,431
IS ALL THE TIME.

138
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:15,868
>> SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN TYPE A,
LIKE HER DAD, SO SHE CALLS ME

139
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,604
JUST TO CALM HER DOWN.

140
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,072
BUT SHE'S ALWAYS MY BABY.

141
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,240
SHE'S ALWAYS MY LITTLE GIRL.

142
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:25,144
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, MOM, GIVE
HER SOME LAST LOVE.

143
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:25,945
>> I LOVE YOU.

144
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:31,150
>> I LOVE YOU, TOO.

145
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:34,053
>> Jeff: ANGELINA, YOU READY
FOR SOME LOVE?

146
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,454
LET'S GET YOUR MOM OUT HERE.

147
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:50,203
ANNA, COME ON OUT.

148
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,104
>> I LOVE YOU.

149
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,907
>> Jeff: ANGELINA, I HEARD YOU
SAY "JUST LIKE YOU TAUGHT ME,"

150
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,477
WHAT IS THAT INDICATIVE OF?

151
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:03,449
>> MY MOM IS LITERALLY THE
STRONGEST WOMAN I KNOW.

152
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:07,086
SHE HAS FIVE KIDS SHE PUT EVERY
OUNCE OF LOVE INTO, AND I'M SO

153
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,355
LUCKY THAT I GET TO BE ONE OF
THEM, BECAUSE I WOULD NOT BE THE

154
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,858
WOMAN WITHOUT HER.

155
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:21,500
I SACRIFICED MYSELF FOR THE
TRIBE YESTERDAY.

156
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:22,101
THAT'S WHAT YOU DID.

157
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,769
>> YOU GOT A LOT OF LOVE.

158
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:28,374
>> Jeff: NOW MOM IS WORKING
THE GAME.

159
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,375
GIVE HER A LOT OF LOVE.

160
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:34,614
>> LOVE YOU, MOM.

161
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,248
>> ALL RIGHT, MIKE.

162
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:36,249
HERE'S YOUR BOYFRIEND JOSH.

163
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:43,489
COME ON OUT, JOSH.

164
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:48,861
>> THAT'S THE WAY.

165
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,162
>> HOW YOU DOING?

166
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,797
>> Jeff: SO MIKE, TELL ME
ABOUT JOSH?

167
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:52,999
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN TOGETHER?

168
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:57,370
>> SIX YEARS AND LIKE WE'RE
SUPER DIFFERENT, BUT WE'RE

169
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:02,708
BONDED LIKE IN A DEEP WAY, AND I
AM SO HAPPY TO SEE HIM, AND

170
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:03,876
STOKED.

171
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:07,146
>> Jeff: MIKE, AS A WRITER,
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS LOVED

172
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,347

ANYTHING I'VE EVER DONE OR SAID.

178
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:26,599
IT MAKES ME REALIZE HOW NOBODY
IS ALONE AND HOW EACH PERSON HAS

179
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,503
A NETWORK OF PEOPLE WHO LOVE
THEM AND YOU'RE NOT JUST

180
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:31,704
IMPACTING THEM.

181
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:35,741
YOU'RE IMPACTING A WHOLE WORLD
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DECENT, GOOD

182
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:39,612

DESTROY MY GAME, BUT, WHATEVER

>> NICE TO MEET YOU.

198
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,110
>> I LOOK LIKE A CRAZY MAN.

199
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:15,548
I JUST PULLED OUT OF THE FOREST.

200
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:16,749
>> Jeff: THERE'S THE HUG.

201
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:20,686
THERE IT IS.

202
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:23,923
SO CHRISTIAN, FIRST THING
EVERYBODY WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT

203
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,024

204
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:25,858
>> YEAH.

205
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:26,993
>> Jeff: SO WE'VE GOTTEN TO
KNOW YOU.

206
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:30,096
SO TELL US ABOUT THIS WOMAN,
EMILY.

207
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:35,101
>> SHE IS THE MOST
SELF-SACRIFICING, KIND, FUNNY,

208
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,003
SMART WOMAN I'VE EVER MET.

209
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:41,841
AN HAVING SOMEONE WHO GETS YOU
AN REALLY UNDERSTANDS HOW YOU'RE

210
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:48,180
FEELING, EVEN BEFORE YOU FEEL
IT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT IS SO

211
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:48,981
PRECIOUS.

212
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,750
>> Jeff: GIVE HIM A LAST HUG,
EMILY.

213
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:51,851
MAKE IT A GOOD ONE.

214
00:10:51,917 --> 00:11:02,194
IT MAY BE THE LAST ONE HE GETS.

215
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,562
>> SEE YOU SOON.

216
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:04,296
ALL RIGHT.

217
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,398
ALL RIGHT.

218
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:08,134
>> Jeff: CHRISTIAN, YOU'RE
EMOTIONS SEEM TO COME OUT AS

219
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,936
EMILY WAS LEAVING, AS YOU WERE
SAYING GOOD-BYE.

220
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,271
>> YEAH.

221
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,974
>> Jeff: WHY IS IT HARD FOR
YOU TO LET THAT EMOTION OUT WHEN

222
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,476
SHE'S STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO
YOU.

223
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:23,649
>> SEEING HER IS GREAT, BUT
LOSING HER FEELS FAR WORSE.

224
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,352
IT'S EASY THE TAKE YOUR LOVE ONE
FOR GRANTED.

225
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,820
YOU SEE THEM EVERY DAY.

226
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:31,357
AND FOR ONCE A DAY I CAN LOOK AT
HER AN REMEMBER THAT MOMENT

227
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:35,895
WHERE SHE WALKED AWAY AND USE
THAT AS A REMINDER OF

228
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,129
APPRECIATING WHAT YOU HAVE.

229
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,932
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF
US WANT TO COME AWAY FROM THIS

230
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:44,904
WITH IS THAT SOME KERNEL YOU CAN
TAKE AWAY FROM THE GAME THAT

231
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,738
CHANGES WHO WE ARE.

232
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:50,276
I THINK THAT'S HOW I'M GOING TO
DO IT.

233
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,077
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

234
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,645

YOU'RE GOING THE RACE UNDER AN
OBSTACLE TO A SAND PIT WHERE YOU

238
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,090

00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:35,160
SAY YOUR LAST GOOD-BYES.

347
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:35,894
SORRY, LOVED ONES.

348
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,197
TIME FOR YOU TO HEAD BACK.

349
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:44,837
>> I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

350
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,606
>> Jeff: MIKE, ANGELINA,
DAVIE, NICK, ENJOY A ONCE IN

351
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,375
ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME AFTERNOON.

352
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:50,175
COME ON DOWN.

353
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:54,079
>> BYE.

354
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:57,483
>> Jeff: GABBY, KARA, ALISON,
CHRISTIAN, GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD

355
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:58,083
BACK TO CAMP.

356
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,019
GOT NOTHING FOR YOU.

357
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:13,432
>> DAVIE.

358
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,333
>> ALL RIGHT, MOTHER.

359
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,735
I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU.

360
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:21,673
>>YOU DON'T REALIZE.

361
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,008
>> AN OCTOPUS.

362
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:26,278
>> OH, MY GOD.

363
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,080
>> SO HOW IS THE GAME GOING?

364
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,716
>> IT'S GOING GOOD.

365
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:31,984
THIS RIGHT HERE COULD BE THE
FINAL FOUR.

366
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:32,684
>> THAT'S AWESOME.

367
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,053
>> ARE YOU RUNNING THE GAME?

368
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,388
>> WORKING THE MIDDLE.

369
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:37,923
EVERYONE THINKS I'M ON THEIR
SIDE.

370
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,726
I DEFINITELY THINK THE FOUR OF
US, I THINK WE HIGH MAKE A DEAL

371
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:41,960
AND MAKE A FINAL FOUR.

372
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:45,464
>> THIS IS EXACTLY THE GROUP OF
FOUR THAT I WANTED HERE TODAY.

373
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,933
THIS IS... I MEAN, BECAUSE THERE
ARE SOME VICIOUS PEOPLE OVER

374
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,803
THERE.

375
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:53,772
AT THE BARBECUE WE OBVIOUSLY
SPENT THE MAJORITY OF OUR TIME

376
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,809
WITH OUR LOVED ONES CATCHING UP,
BUT WE ALSO TOOK THIS TIME TO

377
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,043
TALK SOME STRATEGY.

378
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,213
I WANT TO GO TO THE END WITH
PEOPLE WHO I TRULY RESPECT, AND

379
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,081
THAT YOU WOULD BE HAPPY SEEING
WIN IF IT'S NOT YOURSELF.

380
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,316
>> ABSOLUTELY.

381
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,553
>> THE LOVED ONE VISIT WORKED
OUT PERFECTLY, BECAUSE THE GROUP

382
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,956
OF FOUR WHO WENT IS ACTUALLY THE
GROUP I WANT TO BE IN THE FINAL

383
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:11,924
FOUR.

384
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,193
>> COULDN'T HAVE PICKED A BETTER
GROUP, NO WAY.

385
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,528
>> THIS IS MY FINAL FOUR
IDEALLY.

386
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,362
>> ABSOLUTELY.

387
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,464
>> I WOULD LOVE THAT.

388
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,066
>> THIS IS MY FINAL FOUR.

389
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:26,305
>> I THINK WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS.

390
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:29,808
>> MIKE, NICK, AND ANGELINA,
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT FINAL

391
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:34,446
FOUR, BUT THEY'VE ALL SPENT MUCH
LONGER WITH EACH OTHER THAN I

392
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:38,917
HAVE, BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL ON
THE JABENI TRIBE TOGETHER.

393
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,386
SO I'M STARTING TO FEEL A LITTLE
BIT ON THE OUTSIDE.

394
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:47,793
I DON'T THINK THIS ALLIANCE IS
THE SMARTEST MOVE FOR ME.

395
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,895
>> YOU CAN TELL SHE'S A LITTLE
SHY.

396
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:54,132
I KNEW THAT EVERY COMPLIMENT I
WOULD PAY HER, SHE WOULD BE

397
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,400
EMBARRASSED, YOU KNOW?

398
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:59,671
SO I WAS SAYING WHAT I FELT, BUT
I ALSO WAS MEASURING HOW I SAID

399
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,941
IT SO SHE WOULDN'T GET
EMBARRASSED, YOU KNOW, IN FRONT

400
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,042
OF ALL THOSE STRANGERS.

401
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:07,045
>> BECAUSE YOU'RE ONE WHO THINKS
ABOUT HER BEFORE YOU.

402
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,614
SO YOU THINK ABOUT HOW SHE'S
GOING TO FEEL.

403
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,050
>> WHEN I SAW CHRISTIAN WITH
EMILY, I NOTICED THAT HE WAS

404
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:16,321
COMFORTING HER, AND I REALIZED
THAT'S WHAT CHRISTIAN HAS BEEN

405
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:17,456
TO ME OUT HERE.

406
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:21,093
HE'S PLAYING UP THE ROLE OF
COMFORTER AND FRIEND, AND I

407
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:24,696
CAN'T LET MYSELF GET RIEWRED
INTO THAT SENSE OF SECURITY

408
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:27,466
LIKE, OH, CHRISTIAN IS LOOKING
OUT FOR ME, CHRISTIAN'S GOT MY

409
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:28,100
BACK.

410
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:35,941
I NEED TO PLAY FOR ME.

411
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:40,646
>> I AM FEELING MORE AND MORE
LIKE WE HAVE TO DO CHRISTIAN,

412
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,047
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

413
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,716
CHRISTIAN AND I HAVE MADE NEARLY
EVERY STRATEGIC MOVE TOGETHER,

414
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:47,252
BUT HE'S THE ONE PERCEIVED AS
MAKING ALL THE MOVES, SO I NEED

415
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,656
TO REMOVE HIM SO THAT I AM FREE
TO PLAY MY OWN GAME.

416
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,424
>> NOT A SOUL CAN BEAT HIM.

417
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,560
>> LITERALLY.

418
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:55,761
LITERALLY.

419
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:57,796
I FEEL LIKE THE GAME HAS BUSTED
WIDE OPEN AND IT'S TIME THE

420
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,897
PLAY.

421
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,966
PEOPLE HAVE SEEN ME AS
CHRISTIAN'S SIDEKICK, AND I HAVE

422
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,968
BEEN STRUGGLING TO FIGHT THAT
PERCEPTION.

423
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,270
I WANT RESPECT IN THIS GAME.

424
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:10,576
SO WHAT BETTER WAY THAN TO SLAY
MY NUMBER-ONE ALLY?

425
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:14,279
SO I'VE BEEN MULLING SOMETHING
OVER FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS

426
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:15,514
WORRYING ABOUT WHEN TO MAKE A
MOVE.

427
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:16,982
>> YES.

428
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,217
>> AGAINST CHRISTIAN.

429
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:20,152
WE NEED TO GET CHRISTIAN OUT.

430
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:21,286
>> OH, MY GOSH.

431
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:24,256
>> GABBY WANTS TO BLINDSIDE
CHRISTIAN.

432
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,258
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT WAS COMING
OUT OF HER MOUTH.

433
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,559
IT BLOWS MY MIND.

434
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,661
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET
CHRISTIAN OUT OF THE GAME FOR A

435
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,262
WHILE.

436
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,430
HE'S A REALLY GOOD PLAYER.

437
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,499
SO I'M ALL FOR THIS PLAN.

438
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:59,024
>> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS.

439
00:20:59,091 --> 00:20:59,925
ALL RIGHT.

440
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,160
SHALL WE GET TO TODAY'S IMMUNITY
CHALLENGE?

441
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:04,396
FIRST THINGS FIRST, DAVIE, GOT
TO TAKE IT BACK.

442
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:07,065
NO HELP AT ALL.

443
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:12,304
THANK YOU.

444
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,906
ONCE AGAIN IMMUNITY IS BACK UP
FOR GRABS.

445
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:18,310
FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'RE
GOING TO BALANCE ON A NARROW

446
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:21,279
PERCH WHILE HOLDING A POLE
CONNECTED TO A BUCKET OF WATER.

447
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:25,550
IF AT ANY POINT YOU STEP OFF THE
PERCH OR RAISE THAT POLE TOO

448
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:29,688
HIGH OR DROP IT TOO LOW, THAT
BUCKET WILL EMPTY AND YOU'RE OUT

449
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:31,023
OF THE CHALLENGE.

450
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:36,528
LAST PERSON LEFT STANDING WINS
IMMUNITY, GUARANTEED A ONE IN

451
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,964
SEVEN SHOT AT GETTING TO THE END
OF THIS GAME.

452
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:42,134
LOSERS TRIBAL COUNCIL WHERE
SOMEBODY WILL BECOME THE SIXTH

453
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,301
MEMBER OF OUR JURY.

454
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:44,136
TAKE YOUR SPOTS.

455
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,303
WE'LL GET STARTED.

456
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:52,210
GOOD LUCK.

457
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:53,078
ALL RIGHT.

458
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:53,979
EVERYBODY LOOKING GOOD.

459
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,982
THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.

460
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:03,622
IT REQUIRES YOU BEING IN FULL
CONTROL OF YOUR BODY.

461
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,724
TWO WAYS THIS CHALLENGE CAN GET
YOU.

462
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:10,462
YOU STEP OFF THE PERCH, LOSING
YOUR BALANCE, OR YOU LIFT JUST A

463
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:16,768
LITTLE TOO HIGH OR DROP JUST A
LITTLE TOO LOW, THE BUCKET OF

464
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:24,976
WATER WAITING TO DRENCH YOU,
ENDING YOUR SHOT AT IMMUNITY.

465
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,412
MIKE, THE SLIGHTEST TWITCH AND
MIKE IS OUT.

466
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:28,413
FIRST TO DROP.

467
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,915
WE ARE DOWN TO SEVEN.

468
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:31,683
MIKE NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.

469
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:41,593
THAT'S HOW FAST IT CAN HAPPEN.

470
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,728
ALL RIGHT.

471
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:44,162
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE NEXT
PHASE OF THIS CHALLENGE.

472
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:47,566
YOU'RE GOING TO PLACE YOUR FRONT
FOOT, PLACE IT BEHIND YOUR BACK

473
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:52,037
FOOT, YOUR ARMS FURTHER OUT,
WHICH GIVES YOU LESS LEVERAGE,

474
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,038
MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT.

475
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,540
I'M GOING TO COUNT YOU IN.

476
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:58,243
GABBY, THE SLIGHTEST BIT OF A
MOVE.

477
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,345
GABBY DROPS, SHE IS OUT.

478
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:01,913
SECONDS AWAY FROM MOVING TO THE
NEXT ROUND.

479
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,615
WE ARE DOWN TO SIX.

480
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,183
YOU HAVE TEN SECONDS.

481
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:11,256
GOT TO GET THAT FRONT FOOT
BEHIND YOUR BACK FOOT.

482
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:19,498
SIX, FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO,
ONE.

483
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:24,636
EVERYBODY SUCCESSFULLY
NEGOTIATES THE TRANSITION.

484
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,004
NICE JOB.

485
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,940
WE WILL STAY HERE FOR TEN
MINUTES NOW.

486
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:32,410
YOUR ARM NOW FURTHER OUT, WHICH
GIVES YOU LESS LEVERAGE, MAKING

487
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:35,313
IT MORE DIFFICULT.

488
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:43,755
YOU HEAR THE BREATHING, TRYING
THE FIND THAT MEDITATION.

489
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:56,134
CHRISTIAN CONTINUES TO MAKE A
RISKY MOVE, SCRATCHING HIS HEAD.

490
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:59,905
>> Jeff: ALISON'S LEGS REALLY
TWITCH, BUT SHE'S HOLDING STEADY

491
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:05,443
IN HER PALM.

492
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:13,552
NICK, EVEN A MOVE TO THE FACE IS
RISKY.

493
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:16,254
ALISON CAN'T HANG ON ANY LONGER.

494
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:20,325
ALISON IS OUT, AND WE ARE DOWN
TO FIVE.

495
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:37,375
ANGELINA CAN'T HANG IN ANY
LONGER.

496
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:38,844
ANGELINA IS OUT.

497
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:42,013
WE'RE DOWN TO FOUR.

498
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:48,153
IT IS DAVIE, KARA, CHRISTIAN,
AND NICK.

499
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:56,328
FIGHTING FOR IMMUNITY.

500
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:57,529
ALL RIGHT.

501
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,932
WE'RE GOING THE MOVE YOUR FRONT
FOOT BEHIND YOUR BACK FOOT.

502
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:05,070
THERE'S MORE PRESSURE ON YOUR
ARM, LESS LEVERAGE TOWARD YOUR

503
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:06,271
BODY.

504
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:16,781
YOU'VE GOT TEN SECONDS, NINE,
EIGHT, SEVEN, SIX, FIVE, FOUR,

505
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:21,253
THREE, TWO, ONE.

506
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,788
EVERYBODY AND A HALF GAITS
ANOTHER TRANSITION.

507
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:24,956
>> GOOD JOB, GUYS.

508
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,858
>> Jeff: EVERYBODY SAFE IN
THIS THIRD ROUND.

509
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:31,596
WE WILL GO FOR 20 MINUTES HERE.

510
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,932
>> NICK YOU NEED TO GO HIGHER.

511
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,967
THAT'S GOOD.

512
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,969
JUST HAIR UP.

513
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,472
JUST A HAIR.

514
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:43,975
>> NICK, YOU'RE DROPPING LOW.

515
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,243
JUST HAIR UP.

516
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:50,982
>> Jeff: A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR
NICK DOWN ON THE END.

517
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,550
>> AM I NICE AND CENTERED, GUYS.

518
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:53,919
>> WE DON'T WANT TO MESS YOU UP.

519
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:54,986
NICK'S WAS SUPER OBVIOUS.

520
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:58,256
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON.

521
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:03,295
>> DON'T LOOK AT HIS, NICK.

522
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:05,130
>> Jeff: CHRISTIAN NOW
STARTING TO SHAKE A LOT.

523
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:08,500
YOU CAN SEE THAT RIGHT ARM ALL
OVER THE PLACE.

524
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:12,270
HIS POLE EDGING CLOSER, JUST
SLIDING OFF OF THE ONLY THING

525
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:14,506
HOLDING HIM IN THIS CHALLENGE.

526
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:23,281
CAN HE GET IT BACK UNDER
CONTROL.

527
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,684
BUT IT'S NICK WHO DROPS.

528
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,551
NICK IS OUT.

529
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,286
AN WE'RE DOWN TO THREE.

530
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:33,358
DAVIE, KARA, AND CHRISTIAN, WHO
IS BACK SOLID AGAIN.

531
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,038
"DAVE'S PET SHOW'S" BODY
STARTING --

532
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:51,876
DAVIE'S BODY STARTING TO MOVE
NOW.

533
00:26:51,943 --> 00:27:04,122
>> I DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING.

534
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:05,490
>> Jeff: CHRISTIAN STEPS OFF.

535
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:06,191
CHRISTIAN IS OUT.

536
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:07,759
NO SHOT AT IMMUNITY.

537
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:10,762
WE ARE DOWN TO TWO.

538
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,465
DAVIE AND KARA.

539
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:16,201
A DAVID VERSUS GOLIATH SHOWDOWN.

540
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:20,972
KARA HAS NOT WAVERED THIS ENTIRE
CHALLENGE.

541
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,109
HAS BARELY MOVED.

542
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:32,751
DAVIE STICKING SHAKING BUT STILL
UNDER CONTROL WITH HIS ARM.

543
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:33,985
DAVIE DROPS.

544
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:35,253
DAVIE IS OUT.

545
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:40,625
KARA WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY,
SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

546
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:45,063
CANNOT BE VOTED OUT OF THIS
GAME.

547
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:45,730
>> WOW.

548
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:51,870
WOW.

549
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,939
>> Jeff: KARA, COME ON OVER.

550
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:55,907
>> Jeff: GOOD JOB, KARA.

551
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:57,008
>> GOOD GIRL.

552
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,477
>> Jeff: KARA, INDIVIDUAL
IMMUNITY IS YOURS.

553
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:02,013
SAFE TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,
CANNOT BE VOTED OUT.

554
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,717
AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 32
VERY TOUGH DAY, SOMEBODY VOTED

555
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:06,751
OUT.

556
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:09,220
SOMEBODY WILL BECOME THE SIXTH
AMERICA OF OUR JURY.

557
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:10,188
GRAB YOUR STUFF.

558
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:10,889
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL.

559
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:13,158
CONGRATS.

560
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,026
>> I LIKE THE WAY GABBY IS
THINKING.

561
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,761
IT'S TIME TO TAKE OUT CHRISTIAN.

562
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:22,100
I AM CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC THAT
THIS PLAN WILL SUCCEED, HOWEVER,

563
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,935
WE TRIED TO GET CHRISTIAN OUT
BEFORE.

564
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:26,337
WHAT'S TO SAY HE DOESN'T PULL
SOMETHING OUT OF HIS HAT THIS

565
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,973
THIRD TIME AROUND, AS WELL.

566
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:44,789
>> CONGRATULATIONS, KARA.

567
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:48,059
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

568
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:51,129
>> YOU WERE LIKE A STATUE.

569
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:54,732
>> FINALLY IT WAS TIME TO PROVE
THAT I CAN MAKE MOVES IN THIS

570
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:55,567
GAME.

571
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:58,369
AT THIS POINT IT'S GO BIG OR GO
HOME.

572
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:02,140
AND WHAT BIGGER MOVE THAN GOING
AGAINST YOUR CLOSEST ALLY, WHO

573
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,676
HAPPENS TO BE THE BIGGEST THREAT
IN THE GAME.

574
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:05,510
>> YOU OKAY?

575
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,545
>> I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED.

576
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,814
I WANTED TO DO WELL, YOU KNOW?

577
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:10,815
>> SAME.

578
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:15,220
>> AT THIS POINT WE'VE GOT TO
GET RID OF ALISON.

579
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:19,557
AS LONG AS WE HAVE EVERYONE IN
LINE.

580
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:22,460
>> CHRISTIAN BELIEVES THAT WE'RE
VOTING FOR ALISON, WHICH IS

581
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:25,130
PERFECT, BECAUSE WITH CHRISTIAN
HAVING A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL,

582
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:29,134
YOU HAVE TO TAKE HIM OUT WHEN HE
LEAST EXPECTS IT.

583
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:35,173
SO I'M EXCITED AND I'M NERVOUS
AND I'M SAD, BECAUSE IT MEANS

584
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,109
BETRAYING SOMEONE THAT'S BEEN
CLOSE TO YOU FOR SO LONG, BUT I

585
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:43,815
NEED TO REMEMBER THAT CHRISTIAN
DOESN'T WANT ME TO WIN,

586
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,750
CHRISTIAN WANTS CHRISTIAN TO
WIN.

587
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:53,324
AND SO I HAVE TO DO IT IF I WANT
TO WIN THIS GAME.

588
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:55,260
>>OKAY.

589
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:56,561
LET'S TALK STRATEGY.

590
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,629
>> YEAH.

591
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:00,565
WHO ARE YOU THINKING?

592
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:05,937
>> CHRISTIAN IS THE BIGGEST
THREAT TO WIN THE GAME.

593
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:07,639
100%.

594
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:11,509
HE'S MY CLOSEST ALLY.

595
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:14,212
IT KEEPS HIM FROM GETTING ALL
THE CREDIT.

596
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:18,082
HE'S SUPER SMART.

597
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:22,187
>> OF ALL PEOPLE, GABBY COMES UP
TO ME TO SAY HOW WOULD YOU FEEL

598
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:23,488
ABOUT VOTING OUT CHRISTIAN.

599
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:26,224
I'M LIKE, I'M TOTALLY FINE WITH
IT.

600
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,893
I WAS TRYING TO THINK OF A WAY I
COULD GET THE NUMBERS FOR

601
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,360
CHRISTIAN.

602
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:30,595
I'M MISSED OFF.

603
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:34,032
I SAVED CHRISTIAN'S BUTT FROM
GOING HOME TWICE, AND WHAT DOES

604
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:35,266
HE DO?

605
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:41,206
THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL, HE
TOTALLY BETRAYS ME.

606
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:42,874
>> ALISON ANKARA WOULD BE DOWN.

607
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,342
>> I'LL DO IT.

608
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:45,710
I CAN'T TRUST HIM.

609
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,879
>> YEAH.

610
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:50,081
>> AT THIS POINT CHRISTIAN IS
DEAD TO ME.

611
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:54,319
AND IT'S TIME HE GETS TASTE OF
HIS OWN MEDICINE.

612
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:59,090
>> SHE JUST COMES UP AND SAID,
CHRISTIAN.

613
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:02,060
IF IT'S CHRISTIAN, THAT'S MORE
COMPLICATED AND WE HAVE TO THINK

614
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:03,261
IF HE DOES HAVE AN IDOL.

615
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:04,629
>> I'VE SOON HIS IDOL.

616
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,264
>> OH, REALLY?

617
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:16,307
>> WELL, IF HE PLAYS HIS IDOL,
YOU COULD VOTE FOR GABBY.

618
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:22,347
>> WELL, IF HE PLAYS HIS IDOL,
YOU COULD VOTE FOR GABBY.

619
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:25,350
>> NICK IS TOTALLY DOWN FOR
VOTING CHRISTIAN, BUT GABBY IS

620
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:30,855
THE BACK-UP IN CASE HE PLAYS HIS
IDOL, BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

621
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:33,992
EVEN THOUGH CHRISTIAN BLINDSIDED
ME TWICE, I DON'T TAKE IT

622
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:34,559
PERSONAL.

623
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:35,526
THAT'S PART OF THE GAME.

624
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:37,962
BUT NICK IS CONVINCED THAT
CHRISTIAN HAS TO GO.

625
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:44,102
>> IT'S ABOUT TIME.

626
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:49,507
>> I'VE SHIELDED MYSELF SO FAR
BY HIDING BEHIND PEOPLE, SEEN AS

627
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,577
A BIG THREAT, BUT WHO IS GOING
TO BE MY SHIELD IF I GET

628
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:53,444
CHRISTIAN OUT?

629
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:59,017
SO I GOT TO KEEP CHRISTIAN IN
THIS GAME.

630
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,486
>> OH, MAN.

631
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:04,622
YOU REALLY GOT TO BE CAREFUL.

632
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:08,159
SHE KNOWS SHE NEEDS MOVES IN
THIS GAME TO MOVE FORWARD.

633
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:12,330
AN YOU GUYS DID THAT CARL THING
TOGETHER, RIGHT, SO SHE STILL

634
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:13,798
DOESN'T HAVE HER OWN INDIVIDUAL
MOVE.

635
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:15,033
>> RIGHT.

636
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,268
>> SO SHE'S LIKE, IT'S GOING TO
BE CHRISTIAN, IT'S GOING TO BE

637
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:17,702
CHRISTIAN.

638
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,137
>> I'M FLOORED.

639
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,839
ACCORDING TO DAVIE, GABBY IS
GUNNING FOR ME.

640
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:26,344
SHE FEELS LIKE SHEA DOESN'T HAVE
A CHANCE TO WIN UNLESS SHE MAKES

641
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:27,912
A MOVE AND TAKES ME OUT.

642
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:29,314
I'M STUNNED.

643
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:34,152
GABBY AND I HAVE BEEN TOGETHER
THIS ENTIRE GAME.

644
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:37,555
WE HAVEN'T BEEN SEPARATED FOR
MORE THAN AN HOUR OVER THE

645
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,890
COURSE OF THE WHOLE MONTH.

646
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:42,627
SO I'M HAVING HARD TIME
BELIEVING IT.

647
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:46,731
>> THE PLAN IS TO VOTE OUT
ALISON TONIGHT.

648
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,033
WHAT ABOUT NICK?

649
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,369
>> IS NICK DOWN WITH SENDING ME
HOME?

650
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:55,540
>> I REALLY THINK SO.

651
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:57,475
>> IT'S ME AND YOU.

652
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:00,645
APPARENTLY NICK WAS SO BURNED BY
THE CARL VOTE THAT HE WANTS TO

653
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:01,913
TAKE REVENGE ON ME.

654
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:06,684
I STILL HAVE MY IDOL THAT I CAN
PLAY TO ENSURE ALISON GOES HOME.

655
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:10,188
BUT THAT WOULD LEAVE ME
VULNERABLE AT THE NEXT VOTE.

656
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:13,524
SO THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION FOR
RIGHT NOW IS TO TRY TO REPAIR

657
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:21,399
THE DAMAGE WITH NICK.

658
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:24,602
FIRST OFF, IN HINDSIGHT, I DID
MAKE AN ERROR IN NOT TELLING

659
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,704
YOU.

660
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:28,272
THAT'S NOT -- THAT'S NOT FAIR TO
YOU.

661
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:31,309
IT'S NOT FAIR TO THE
RELATIONSHIP, AN I UNDERSTAND

662
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:34,979
WHY YOU FEEL MAD.

663
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:41,152
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE -- I'M OWN
UP TO WHAT WAS A MISCALCULATION

664
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,121
ON MY PART.

665
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,322
YOU'RE FRUSTRATED BY THE
SITUATION.

666
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:48,860
>> I'M TRYING TO GET OVER IT.

667
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:52,563
>> CHRISTIAN IS APOLOGIZING
PROFUSELY TO ME SAYING, YOU

668
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:56,234
KNOW, HE TOOK OUR RELATIONSHIP
FOR GRANTED, BUT I DON'T TRUST

669
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,470
CHRISTIAN ANYMORE AND I PROBABLY
NEVER ALMOST NOW I'M GOING TO

670
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,638
MANIPULATE HIM.

671
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,975
IF HE'S CONVINCED HE'S GOT THE
MASON-DIXON BACK TOGETHER,

672
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:06,144
THAT'S GOING THE MAKE IT THAT
MUCH EASIER TO BLINDSIDE HIM.

673
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:11,449
>> HERE'S THE THING, THE MAIN
THING IS THAT ALISON THINKS SHE

674
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:14,352
HAS FOOTING, BUT SHE DOESN'T
HAVE FOOTING.

675
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,954
>> WELL, THAT'S WHAT I WANTED
GONE.

676
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:17,822
>> I KNOW.

677
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,425
>> AS LONG AS ALISON'S GONE,
THAT'S FINE.

678
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:23,795
>> NOT BEING IMMUNE HAS PUT ME
IN A TIGHT SPOT.

679
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:25,563
I KNOW I'M GETTING VOTES.

680
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:29,500
FORTUNATELY NICK STILL WANTS TO
WORK WITH ME.

681
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,369
>> NICK SAYS THE PLAN IS GOOD,
RIGHT?

682
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:34,338
>> GET RID OF CHRISTIAN, YES.

683
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:38,276
>> I'M PRETTY SURE I CAN MARSHAL
ENOUGH VOTES TO VOTE OUT ALISON.

684
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,745
I'D RATHER NOT USE MY IDOL, BUT
I'LL PLAY IT IF I FEEL I HAVE

685
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,613
TO, BUT HOPEFULLY I DON'T HAVE.

686
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,682
TO AND SO FAR I'VE BEEN RIGHT
EVERY TIME.

687
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:15,713
>> Jeff: LET'S NOW BRING IN
THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

688
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:21,986
ELIZABETH, JOHN, DAN, ALEC, AND
CARL VOTED OUT AT THE LAST

689
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:26,357
TRIBAL COUNCIL.

690
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:29,961
SO LAST TRIBAL ANOTHER
BLINDSIDE.

691
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:31,729
ANGELINA, WHAT WAS THE FALLOUT
BACK AT CAMP?

692
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:35,066
>> YEAH, I MEAN, THERE WERE SOME
PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPER PISSED.

693
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:36,234
>> Jeff: WHO WAS UPSET?

694
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,002
>> NICK WAS PRETTY UPSET.

695
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,804
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS COMING
EITHER.

696
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,807
>> Jeff: NICK, WHAT WAS YOUR
FRUSTRATION.

697
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:46,010
>> IT WAS A BLIEKDSIDE, AND IT
WAS A BIG MOVE, BUT JUST BECAUSE

698
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:48,379
SOMETHING IS A BIG MOVE DOESN'T
MAKE IT A GOOD MOVE.

699
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,147
>> Jeff: WHO WERE YOU
FRUSTRATED WITH?

700
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:51,749
>> CHRISTIAN MAINLY.

701
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,984
I DIDN'T GET IT.

702
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:56,454
IF YOU'RE WITH ME AND YOU TRUST
ME, WHY COULDN'T YOU TELL ME?

703
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:59,123
SO EVERYBODY KNEW I WAS PISSED,
I WAS.

704
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,359
>> Jeff: WHEN YOU HAVE
SOMEBODY, CHRISTIAN, COME AT YOU

705
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,694
LIKE NICK AND SAY, HEY, I DIDN'T
LIKE IT.

706
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:07,365
DOES IT PUT A NEW FEAR IN YOU
THAT A GUY I THAWING I WAS WITH

707
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:08,533
IS NOW AGAINST ME.

708
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:11,302
>> I CERTAINLY TAKE IT VERY
SERIOUSLY, AND IT DOES AFFECT

709
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:14,438
YOUR THINKING GOING FORWARD AND
SAYING, YOU KNOW, FOR ONE YOU

710
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:18,476
HAVE TO REASSESS YOUR JUDGMENTS
AS TO HOW PEOPLE WILL REACT.

711
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:20,177
AND THAT'S ON ME.

712
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:23,981
>> Jeff:
>> WE WENT OFF TO THE SIDE AND

713
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,918
TALKED ABOUT IT AN REBUILT OUR
RELATIONSHIP.

714
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:30,054
IN MY HEAD, IF IT'S SOMEBODY YOU
DON'T CARE ABOUT, YOU DON'T

715
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:32,924
CARE, BUT THE PERSON YOU CARE
ABOUT, YOU SAY, HEY, WE HAVE A

716
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,793
PROBLEM, AND IF WE'RE GOING TO
CONTINUE TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP,

717
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,061
WE NEED TO WORK IT OUT.

718
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:40,965
>> Jeff: GABBY, IT'S SO
COMPLICATED, BECAUSE YOU WANT TO

719
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,801
MAKE THE BIG MOVE TO SHOW YOU'RE
PLAYING THE GAME, BUT IT CAN

720
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:47,138
HURT FEELINGS, AND THOSE HURT
FEELINGS CAN THEN CHANGE THE

721
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:48,406
GAME AGAIN.

722
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:50,975
>> YEAH, IT'S HARD, BECAUSE WHEN
I CAME INTO THIS GAME, I NEEDED

723
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:54,845
A LOT OF REASSURANCE, AND THAT
CAME FROM OTHER PEOPLE A LOT OF

724
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,915
THE TIME, AN NOW I FIND
REASSURANCE IN MYSELF.

725
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:01,686
THAT'S WHAT MY DECISIONS GOING
FORWARD MANY THIS GAME ARE

726
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:02,887
ABOUT.

727
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,790
I'M GOING TO DO LESS, DO YOU
THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT MOVE, DO

728
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,960
YOU GIVE ME REASSURANCE, AN NOW
I'M SAYING WITH CONFIDENCE, THIS

729
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:13,030
IS HOW I'M GOING FORWARD, AND IF
IT GETS ME VOTED OUT, AT LEAST I

730
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:14,231
DID SOMETHING WITH GUMPTION.

731
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:17,735
>> Jeff: ALISON, THE LAST FEW
TRIBALS YOU HAVE SPOKEN OPENLY

732
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,905
THAT YOU FELT YOU WERE A FAR
GET, THAT YOU WERE A THREAT.

733
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:26,377
>> I LOOKED THE GRIM REAPER, WHO
IS YOU WITH YOUR FREAKIN' TORCH

734
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:30,648
SNUFFER IN THE EYES, LAST TRIBAL
COUNCIL, AND I WALKED AWAY BEING

735
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:31,816
MORE OF A THREAT.

736
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:33,651
>> Jeff: YOU THINK YOU'RE MORE
OF A THREAT BECAUSE WHY IN.

737
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:38,522
>> BECAUSE I SURVIVED BEING ON
THE BOTTOM AND HELPED PULL OFF A

738
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,156
GREAT BLINDSIDE.

739
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:40,858
IT WAS NOT AN VJ MOVE.

740
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:45,630
IT TOOK FIVE VOTES, BUT IT WAS
MY NECK ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.

741
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:49,033
>> Jeff: ANGELINA, DO YOU FEEL
THAT EVERYBODY IS AN EQUAL

742
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,834
THREAT?

743
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,335
IS ALISON WORRIED ABOUT NOTHING?

744
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:53,571
BECAUSE THERE ARE SEVEN OTHERS
SURROUNDING?

745
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:58,309
>> NEW YORK I DON'T THINK THAT
EVERYONE IS AN EQUAL THREAT.

746
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:03,180
MY CRITERIA IS SOMEONE WHO I
DON'T SEE ANY ENDING WITH IS A

747
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:04,115
GOOD PERSON TO GO.

748
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:06,450
>> Jeff: NICK, WHAT IS THE
CRITERIA FOR YOU?

749
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:10,087
>> WELL, PUTTING PEOPLE ON THE
JURY, AND WE'RE ALSO PUTTING WHO

750
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:14,392
WE GO TO THE END WITH, SO YOU
CAN FIND SOMEBODY WHO YOU WANT

751
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:18,663
ON THE JURY YOU DON WANT TO GO
TO THE END WORK IT LOOKS LIKE A

752
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:20,264
GOOD PERSON TO TAKE OUT.

753
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:22,199
>> Jeff: IS IT REALLY THAT
SIMPLE, MIKE?

754
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:25,970
>> A LOT OF TIMES YOU GET RID OF
A THREAT AND YOU REALIZED, OH,

755
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:27,738
THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE RIGHT
PERSON.

756
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:28,939
IT'S NEVER EASY.

757
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:30,207
IT'S NEVER SAFE.

758
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:33,744
IT'S A GAME ABOUT DECEPTION, AND
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALL

759
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:38,516
ARE VERY CONSCIOUS OF.

760
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:39,183
>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

761
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,018
IT IS TIME TO VOTE.

762
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:46,190
GABBY, YOU'RE UP.

763
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:55,366
>> IF THIS DOESN'T WORK, THEN
I'M LOSING MY CLOSEST ALLY AND

764
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:58,502
MY BEST FRIEND IN THIS GAME, BUT
IT'S SOMETHING I NEED TO DO FOR

765
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:10,681
MY GAME.

766
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:46,250
>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
VOTES.

767
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,485
OKAY.

768
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,321
IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,

769
00:39:50,387 --> 00:39:57,228
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.

770
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:57,695
OKAY.

771
00:39:57,762 --> 00:40:00,765
>> A SECOND JEFF.

772
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:12,209
I'M NOT QUITE SURE YET.

773
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:13,444
I'LL PLAY IT.

774
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:17,148
THIS HAS BEEN IN MY VIEW FOR THE
PAST FOUR TRIBAL COUNCILS, AND

775
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:30,461
AS ONE MIGHT IMAGINE, IT IS
SLIGHTLY UNCOMFORTABLE.

776
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:43,240
SO I COULD BE WRONG, BUT I'M
PLAYING THIS FOR MYSELF TONIGHT.

777
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:45,576
>> Jeff: THIS IS A HIDDEN
IMMUNITY IDOL.

778
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:49,680
ANY VOTES CAST FOR CHRISTIAN
WILL NOT COUNT.

779
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,549
I'LL READ THE VOTES.

780
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,518
>> WOW.

781
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:55,820
FIRST VOTE CHRISTIAN.

782
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:58,589
DOES NOT COUNT.

783
00:40:58,656 --> 00:40:59,123
CHRISTIAN.

784
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,991
DOES NOT COUNT.

785
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:03,260
>> HOW DID YOU GET THAT BIG
BRAIN?

786
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:08,599
>> Jeff: CHRISTIAN, DOES NOT
COUNT.

787
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:09,266
CHRISTIAN, DOES NOT COUNT.

788
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:13,270
>> HE'S SO SMART.

789
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:15,773
>> Jeff: CHRISTIAN.

790
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:20,244
DOES NOT COUNT.

791
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:20,811
ALISON.

792
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:22,713
THAT'S ONE VOTE ALISON.

793
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:28,219
>> I'M SO SORRY, ALISON.

794
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:28,786
>> Jeff: GABBY.

795
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:30,187
>> OH, MY GOD.

796
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:31,222
>> Jeff: WE'RE TIED.

797
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:39,730
ONE VOTE ALISON, ONE VOTE GABBY,
ONE VOTE LEFT.

798
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:43,133
13th PERSON VOTED OUT AND
THE SIXTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,

799
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:43,534
GABBY.

800
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:45,536
>> OH, MY GOD.

801
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:45,936
WOW.

802
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:52,843
>> I'M SORRY.

803
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:57,748
>> GOOD GAME, GUYS.

804
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:59,750
>> Jeff: GABBY, THE TRIBE HAS
SPOKEN.

805
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:02,987
>> BY, GABBY.

806
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:04,722
>> SORRY, CHRISTIAN, I LOVE YOU.

807
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:13,898
>> WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER SOON,
OKAY?

808
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:17,635
>> Jeff: WELL WORK ONLY SEVEN
PEOPLE LEFT AND EVERYBODY SEEING

809
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,738
EACH OTHER AS THREATS, THERE'S
NOWHERE TO HIDE.

810
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:22,907
GRAB YOUR TORCHES, HEAD BACK TO
CAMP.

811
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:26,543
GOOD NIGHT.

815
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:36,787
FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.

816
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:45,930
>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON
"SURVIVOR," EVERYONE IS ON THE

817
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:47,164
CHOPPING BLOCK.

818
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,133
>> I WANT NEW ENGLAND OUT NEXT.

819
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:50,167
-- NICK OUT NEXT.

820
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,269
>> IS IT BETTER TO TAKE OUT
CHRISTIAN?

821
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:53,804
>> I WANT IT TO BE NICK.

822
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:56,874
>> I'M DROOLING AT THIS IDEA.

823
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:59,443
>> NOW IS THE TIME TO TAKE YOU
OUT.

824
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,911
>> IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S MORE
POSSIBILITIES THAN THERE HAS

825
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:02,246
EVER BEEN BEFORE.

826
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:05,249
>> I STARTED THIS GAME AS AN
UNDERDOG.

827
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:08,419
I STILL FEEL LIKE I WAS KIND OF
AN UNDERDOG, BUT FOR ME IT WAS A

828
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:13,824
PERSONAL TRIUMPH TO DO SOMETHING
WITH CONFIDENCE AND NOT SEEK

829
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:15,926
REASSURANCE FROM ALL OVER.

830
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:19,730
BUT IF PEOPLE SAW SOMETHING IN
ME THAT THEY WANTED TO TAKE OUT,

831
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:22,800
THEN MAYBE I'M MORE OF A GOLIATH
THAN I THOUGHT.
